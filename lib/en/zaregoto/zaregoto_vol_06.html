<p class="null-p">On that note, have you ever thought of yourself as the protagonist of a story? You do not need to have much conviction about it, but have you ever, at least once, thought of yourself as an existence somewhere in an enormous story? Too predestined to be just chance, too inevitable to be just an incident, too karmic to be just a coincidence, too fated to be just an accident, anything, anytime, anywhere, when something abnormal occured around you, having thought that, have you never ended up thinking that? That there is something like an outline here and that you and others are just following it, idly and unconsciously, being pulled along the same weird way that magnets draw iron sand to create a sort of object along the glass pane in between, in a place you don't know, by some large someone that you don't perceive at all, in a place you don't know, a large Story that you don't perceive at all is moving, if you have not pondered that even once-------then you do not deserve to be alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a person is not alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's just inertia.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each and every person has a predefined role. There is no pointless person, everyone is a cog for the world. Even the tragic cog just spinning in place in a completely meaningless location, even such hollowness greatly a ects its surroundings……an existence that doesn't a ect the world, true solitude that does not relate with anyone, it doesn't exist even as a nonexistent existence. Even existences that were long ago rejected by reality, those fantastic and illusory existences (whether those that were called gods or demons, in this case it has the same meaning), continue to a ect the current environment.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is karma.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is predestination.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the Story exists.</p>
<p class="null-p">Complete with unwavering existence and overwhelming influence. "And if that is necessary, if that must absolutely be done, then whether the performer had or had not the intent is irrelevant. If it is not done today, it will just be done tomorrow, and if it is not done tomorrow, then someone else will do it. If something must occur, even if it does not occur, it is just the same as if it had occurred. Taken the other way, the unknown possibilities where it does not occur----the 'what if' parallel world does not even slightly exist, as neither hope nor despair."</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, these are not the words of the user of nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">You can forget them, as if you had been nipped by a fox.</p>
<p class="null-p">What will begin is an absurd and ridiculous story.</p>
<p class="null-p">No one would believe it if I were to tell it, not that it is something that can be told to anyone trustworthy, a story of 800 deceptions . A desperate story whe re everyone would be greatly deceiving someone, and that everything told would be a lie. The participating people, each and every one of them, would simply lose out. A story, through and through. One of them does not even listen to other people, and their world closes shut the moment they do. A story that cannot be argued. A spine-chilling story where friendship and trust are impossible, stu ed with blasphemy and gluttony. An anarchic story of the worst crossed with ugliness and weakness crossed with fragility. A story of the aftermath of a battlefield stu ed with blood and covered in blood and stu ed with corpses and covered with corpses. An ordinary story that misses its chance to depart from the norm, and ends up fated to lose everything as a result. A completely harmonious story that manages to lose all meaning and will and significance, and becomes superfluously purposeless and ignorant and inorganic. A decaying story that definitively colors out the white, that mixes in the utmost chaos.</p>
<p class="null-p">A dull and uninteresting story wholly lacking in emotion and any sense of service. A story that makes you wonder about its author's mental state given how selfish and devoid of readers it is. Not one decent person makes an appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone, each and every one, is mad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone, each and every one, is broken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone, each and every one, is sick.</p>

<p class="null-p">0</p>
<p class="null-p">I grew tired of hearing your lies.</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, I had prior knowledge about Kigamine, an assistant professor at the Human Biology Department of Kouto National University. Contrary to expectations, it may not have been enough information to be called prior knowledge, but if I remember correctly, I heard that name from the mouth of Aoi Mikoko, a classmate of mine from the same department of Meikan</p>
<p class="null-p">Private University, around May this year at the Shinkyogoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm. Kiga? Kigamine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wrong! You're pronouncing it like some starving person! That's scary!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikoko-chans traightmanned me with an exaggerated motion. "No way! Ikkun, you don't know about that famous professor? Like 'a giant homerun to the backscreen, except during the season-opening ceremony' !" "Famous," I said after a moment of pause with a straw clenched between my lips. "Why would I know about a professor at a di erent school?" "She comes to our school, too! I'm even attending one of her classes! Third period on Fridays! Right after lunch break!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikoko-chan energetically rattled on. "It's a super popular lecture, so it's like baaaam, and then boooooom, the huge lecture hall is packed together like potatoes being washed! Some people even skip lunch to get seats!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh. Third period on Fridays, that would be language study for me….</p>
<p class="null-p">Italian. Hmm. So, what is the name of the class?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Name of the class."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhhh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is the class about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Class, about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhhh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are just skipping that class!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so not! I'm just always sleeping!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">We were in the McDonalds located near the center of Shinkyogoku Road. We had come here because I had been dragged along by Mikoko-chan to help her with shopping, and I had come to realize that one must not incidentally tag along with a girl's shopping, and just past noon I had become completely worn out, and so we were in the midst of a small break. There were quite a few paper bags next to the table. And in the paper bags were what I could only presume were abnormally-priced clothing. Mikoko-chan was apparently surprisingly rich. I thought or did not think that it may not be bad to tag along with her, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you know, Assistant Professor Kigamine is really, really famous!" Mikoko-chan reverted the topic as to avoid having to talk about something inconvenient to herself. "And she's really pretty. Mikoko-tan admires her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pretty? Oh, a she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I could not tell by the name Kigamine Yaku, and given the way Mikoko-chan described the person, I had figured them to be a man, but one also does not usually refer to a man as pretty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup! She teaches while wearing a lab coat. Lab coat, a lab coat! I usually don't like science teachers because they're hard in the head, but once you get past a certain point, they're kinda cool. Ah, now that we mention it, maybe we can stop by and buy a lab coat since we're out here already. Ikkun, where do you think they sell lab coats?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like I have seen some at stores that specialize in uniforms... also I would think art universities would sell them in bulk in their stores."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Art stores? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Artists usually wear lab coats when they are working with oil. That or aprons. So that it's fine to get dirty. Even science types normally wear it to be fine to get dirty , right? These are not wedding gowns, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said as I imagined Mikoko-chan in a lab coat.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">Not bad at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although in that case, you must keep the glasses."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?" Mikoko-chan tilted her head to the side. Given her expression, it seemed her intent to buy a lab coat was in jest, unfortunately. "Ikkun, so weird. Oh well. You're Ikkun because you're weird. So, as I was saying--... are you listening? Hello? Ikkun, what're you thinking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? No, I am listening. I was not at all thinking about Tomoe-chan in a lab coat or Muimi-chan in a lab coat or anything. I was not at all thinking that Tomoe-chan would look the best in it while Muimi-chan looks absolutely terrible in it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gosh! Ikkun, you're going on about silly stu again! How vulgar! Like 'it's not scary if we cross it together, except it's a rope bridge!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh... it is wonderful to be with a girl who plays the straight-man properly. Kunagisa and Aikawa-san and most people seem to play the fool, and it exhausts me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what were we talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were really not listening... shock~," Mikoko-chan doubled over in despair. Five seconds later, she revived. "About yesterday! Mikoko-tan ran into Doctor Kigamine in the university lecture hall!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikoko-san said emphatically, as if announcing a tremendous incident.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl really has tough vocal chords.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A near-miss!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You missed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It wasn't a miss though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…. wait, yesterday was Friday…. right? Does she have classes other than on Monday? This Assistant Professor Kigamine"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dunno. Even if she didn't, she probably was just there for some other reason," Mikoko-san continued, not considering this a big deal. "And then!</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I wasn't paying attention, wham!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wham! Mikoko-chan held out both of her palms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I ran into her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you ran into her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Teacher Kigamine's files and papers and books spilled all over the hallway. Wabam, flutter flutter-."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikoko-chan hung her head in shame. Really, she had such exaggerated responses. Although, if one were to say that it is not at all boring watching her, they would be right.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh-…. so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so I apologized and apologized, but Teacher Kigamine smiled serenely and said, 'it is nothing to worry that much over' ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Handled like an adult."</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'I had already predicted beforehand that we would collide in this hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our crash here was but guidance from the tip of the greater destiny.' "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Handled so strangely."</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Run away run away run away!</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I asked. 'What do you mean?' "</p>
<p class="null-p">"It does not seem to me like the time to be asking such questions."</p>
<p class="null-p">What are you, a hero?</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, by that point, Teacher wasn't looking at me anymore. She was picking up her files, and then she mumbled something like 'in other words, in this world this girl and I only have the relationship to collide in this hallway …. that is destiny. That is karma. However, a means for avoiding the chosen inevitability, too…. must certainly, inevitably exist…. no matter how great an existence destiny may be, that is still but a mere landmark…. yet more destiny exists outside the scope of destiny…. resolutely, and without any sort of opposition e ect', and then as Aoi Mikoko looked on with a flabbergasted look, Teacher Kigamine turned her back to me and left. Chalacha-n, cha, chacha, cha-n. Chalalala-n."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…."</p>
<p class="null-p">The peaceful BGM she sounded did not suit the scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Ikkun, what'd you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person is definitely whack."</p>
<p class="null-p">One cannot underestimate university faculty.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, what can I say, because after all, educational faculty at universities are people who have always devoted themselves to studying…. (distant look).</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Mikoko-san had a displeased expression. She puckered her lips, pu ed her cheeks, and showed an extremely obvious displeased look. It seemed she did not appreciate my thought ('that person is definitely whack'). It seemed Mikoko-chan had been hoping for something more positive and in agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. was I supposed to say something like 'sounds like a cool person'?" "Uhh-…. gosh! Like 'firing a hundred rocket-style fireworks in quick succession, except under a clear, blue sky!' " Mikoko-chan slapped down on the not-particularly-sturdy-looking table in McDonalds. "Sure, you might think she's just a weird person based on what I said! But she was really cool! The way she moves, or more like the way she acts! In a way that I can't get across in words!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, as a girl, she just makes you think she's really, really cool!</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what I wanted to say! I just wish you could get what I meant to say!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You do not need to be so insistent…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I tried to play it cool by sipping at my drink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, really, certainly, you could tell she's cool! Like, as a girl, the ideal form! Made me want to become someone like her down the line!" "Cool, huh--…. well, I know a few cool women as well. But, without exceptions they are all tall. At the very least, 175 centimeters. Mikoko-chan, it is impossible for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H- how cruel!" Mikoko-chan stood from her chair and made a boxing pose. "It- it's something I fret over! My height, I think about it a lot, absentmindedly! Ikkun's short, too! Not much di erent from me, too! Abominable, Ikkun! Brute! Repulsive! Like 'a million-dollar smile, except it's McDonalds' and 'we're entering summer, except you're a vampire' and</p>
<p class="null-p">'your face is safe, except you're boxing' !"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mikoko-chan, you are the best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Triple combo.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ikkun's stupid!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikoko-chan spun around, turning her back to me at one point, and then chopped at me with enough force to crush my windpipe (although she stopped right in front).</p>
<p class="null-p">Haa….</p>
<p class="null-p">But you know….</p>
<p class="null-p">"The real deal is di erent, after all…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so.</p>
<p class="null-p">What pulled me out of my pointless flashback scene and back into reality was a cool, clear voice. I stopped staring meaninglessly at the ceiling and returned my gaze to the source of that voice in front of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">The location was no longer the Shinkyogoku McDonald's, but instead a certain large domestic hotel located x notches in a di erent direction, in its first-floor cafe. We sat facing each other at a table for four. One was myself of course, and the other -- was, well, Assistant Professor Kigamine Yaku. She was of course not in a lab coat, but rather a navy-colored suit properly adhering to social norms. Her fairly long hair was loosely tied together near her nape, and she wore frameless glasses. Slightly thick eyebrows, and a beauty spot below her right eye. Her front hair was parted toward her right, and I see, even with both of us seated I could discern her height thanks to how she kept her back straightened. She may not be as tall as Suzunashi-san, but she could probably line shoulders with</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san. Mikoko-chan's description of her as cool fit perfectly.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a shame.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even acknowledging her as beautiful and cool , if I could add but one more word---</p>
<p class="null-p">"---you look like you're appraising people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Uh, uh huh," I hurriedly responded to Assistant Professor Kigamine</p>
<p class="null-p">Yaku. "Ah, if that bothers you, I must apologize. It is like a habit of mine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A habit, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfortunately, I have a terrible memory. I would not consider myself as having an observant eye, but as a result, or perhaps out of necessity, when I meet someone for the first time, I must hammer some characteristics into my head or I forget them entirely."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do not mind. I had already predicted that you would be someone whose nature was like that." Assistant Professor Kigamine brushed my apology and excuse aside, and then she nodded. "I would not call it a habit so much, but I also have a custom I follow. Or should I call it a custom, or something else…. anyways, when I meet someone, I cannot help but think about what that person means to me, and where that person is positioned within my flowchart of decision-making. Fufufu…. in general though, people do tend to look alike, and it's hard to distinguish between them without taking a careful look, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh huh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All of them just imitate others…. like they're afraid of being distinguished from others…. like they've learned to find comfort in being a follower, in being mass-produced-----as if they have resigned their unique names, which is just like saying that they've laid themselves at the feet of destiny, or perhaps accepted it…. fufufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment I thought she was making a joke, but it seemed by the latter half she was just talking to herself. In that case, she was not making a joke, but rather that was her true thoughts .</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine returned her gaze to me, as if she were firing lasers through me. Her lips were curled in a smile, but her smile seemed filled more with intimidation, and her expression hinted less friendliness and more wariness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"While you are currently in the midst of summer break…. us professors do not have anything called a break. As such, there does not exist such a thing as idle time for this Kigamine Yaku…. so, allow me to get right to the point." "Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, today is the first of August. As Assistant Professor Kigamine implied, university exams ended yesterday, and so I was beginning my summer break today. However, having summer break equated to idle time so simply rubbed me the wrong way. While it was true that I was not particularly busy, that did not mean that I was simply lying around being lazy, I have a couple problems of my own. For example, the left arm I injured last month in Aichi</p>
<p class="null-p">(regrettably, it seemed Kokoromi-sensei's treatment went above and beyond satisfactory, so while I would still have scars, I was told it would heal with no lingering e ects, but still, it was too early for me to have removed the cast), or having to watch over Hime-chan's studies because she managed to score in the red for every single semester exam she took, or that I feel sluggish and began accompanying Miiko-san on her morning training routines (which are pretty rough), or, well, and so on and so forth. Anyways, I meant to say that I am not simply lying around. To the point where I could have been excused if I had ignored the call-out by a professor of a class I do not even take.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should also mention that I was told to meet her at 3PM. Yet assistant professor Kigamine showed up at 3:15. I was tempted to ask if she mistook this for one of her classes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. would you mind, before we get to the point?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because she was displeased by being sidestepped, Assistant Professor Kigamine scrunched her brows just a bit. She seems to be just as obsessive-compulsive and di cult as she looks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did you find out my cell phone number? I am an extremely closed-o person, so I hardly ever tell anyone my phone number." "-- I had already predicted beforehand that you would find me suspicious. However, that," she shrugged. "Can be done in a great many ways. There are very few things in this world that cannot be found if you wish to search. Or perhaps I should say there cannot be."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to know how, specifically."</p>
<p class="null-p">This was something I wanted clarified. As for why, that was one of the reasons -- or rather, the only reason that I agreed to meet her. A phone call to a phone number that should not be known. I do not live a peaceful-enough life to leave that mystery be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no meaning to be gained by knowing. Nothing" Assistant</p>
<p class="null-p">Professor Kigamine continued to parry my question. "There are many ways. You too could immediately think of at least three ways of doing that, can't you? So, there is nothing to be gained. Nothing important or meaningful…. this, might be something important or meaningful to you, but the important thing, is that I, myself, am the type of human being that does not pick and choose my methodology in order to achieve my goal. I wanted to know your phone number, so I learned it. Is that not enough?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a way, she had told me enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">More than enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is well to be wary of me, in fact it is a reaction I would recommend myself. The people that say simply that you should trust other people have it easy. However, when it comes to making a decision about me, when it comes to evaluating me, I think it would not be too late to decide after hearing me out. After all, you came here to do that, did you not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">I decided to take a step back. I thought this was the type of person that is annoying if you dig too deep. Annoying, I say, but I felt like I had already stepped into her realm of annoyance, but still. Well, that is true, that when it comes to the overall decision, and a means of responding, indeed, it would not be too late to do after hearing her story.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It appears you come equipped with calm, rational judgment. I had already predicted beforehand that you are that type of understanding person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, your point…. what is it you want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Direct to the point," Assistant Professor Kigamine said. "You were a match for my glasses."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was far too direct.</p>
<p class="null-p">I braced myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether she recognized my mental reaction or not, Assistant Professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine smiled a mischievous, knowing smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you believe in what is called destiny?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">There it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">There it was there it was there it was. Ever since I recalled my conversation with Mikoko-chan, the misgivings I felt! The malaise! The wariness! The primal instincts of avoiding this situation! I thought, in the back of my mind, that she might bring up this sort of topic, but!</p>
<p class="null-p">Destiny, ahh, destiny!</p>
<p class="null-p">What a grandiose theme….</p>
<p class="null-p">Second only to love .</p>
<p class="null-p">"D, destiny…. you say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Ahh, I'm not meaning to say we were lovers in a past life or anything of that sort, so rest assured. I simply want to ask if you believe in the sort of thing that can be called destiny ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh huh…. well, let me see, umm…. I thought otherwise when you mentioned such an exaggerated word as destiny , but if you were to rephrase that as inevitability or karma , I would have to say such rule-like things exist? Reaping what you sow, poetic justice. In other words…. the apple will fall , rain will fall , the sun is bright , the night is dark ,</p>
<p class="null-p">something funny will make you laugh , something sad will make you cry ---" "If you're living you will die ," Assistant Professor Kigamine smirked. "I had already predicted beforehand that you would have that sort of opinion."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. if you say so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Karma….</p>
<p class="null-p">Come to think of it, I do not remember the context, but I remember saying something like mistaken karma. Now, what ever did I say that for….</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something on your mind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I am sorry, I was just reminiscing about something. So, what was it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Something about karma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu. Yes, cause and e ect -- in other words what is obvious. What is natural, what is natural, naaaaatuuuuuuraaaaaal. This is a case where I would not mind if you were to pull out the quote God does not play with dice. While we are capable of a ecting the minute details of the future, we cannot change things like the greater current. Being alive and not dying is something that no one can do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nobody."</p>
<p class="null-p">The way she spoke sounded like she was persuading herself more than she was speaking to me. It seems this person, in a characteristic not uncommon among the obsessive-compulsive, did not take any heed to the existence of others. While it would be hypocritical of me to say anything about that trait, I still found it di cult to accept, having been called out here by the person in question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand it was rude, but I investigated your background."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Assistant Professor Kigamine seemed to make a declaration.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she curled her lips, seemingly pleased.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Interesting. Your background is truly interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Background….. that word alone indicated nothing about how much she had dug up. That, or at least going that far, was certainly on a di erent level than looking up my cell phone number. Kunagisa would have favorably manipulated the critical points even without my asking. Half-assed information-gathering abilities would simply lead to a pile of faux knowledge. However, how about this person….? I may be speaking subjectively, but from my experience thus far, this sort of person is extremely skillful at these things. I would not go so far as to say the snake knows the snake's path best, but….</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is already impressive for you to have been a liated with the ER3 System, but what was truly astonishing was the records you left behind. To be honest, it is impossible for me to comprehend why you would drop out of the ER Program and leave yourself in the care of such an outward, northern island, and in a common university at that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know about the ER Program."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, not that it is particularly hard to find that out, given that I had been making no e ort to hide that fact. There is nothing you can really do to hide that you have studied abroad. That was why, although my problems preceded that , the ER3 brand name stood out to professors with all its shining glory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, I would imagine the records I left behind are untrue. When I was over there, I was buddies with one Omokage Magokoro. I simply could not keep up in their system and turned tail and came home. I am a drop-out, a drop-out. Part of it may have been homesickness. But anyways, the person I was buddies with was incredible, and I think our doings may have been…." "And then -- even after you returned to Japan, you had a hand in a lot of things. A lot, a lot. Aaaaaa loooooooot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine continued, completely ignoring me. I would prefer if she listened to people even just a tiny bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For example, this May. Several students at the Rokumeikan Private University, which you attend, passed away. And not because of an accident or something, but because of murder."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Murder. Murder. Muuurrrrdeeerrr. Along with what can only be described as a terrifying mass-murder case that occurred at the same time…. it is said that with regards to both cases, like an esteemed detective that shows up in a traditional, stereotypical murder mystery novel, solving them swiftly and skillfully, was none other than, you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm-…. that is a wonderfully comfortable misunderstanding. In fact it is so wrong I cannot even begin to imagine how such a misunderstanding could have come forth."</p>
<p class="null-p">But the Assistant Professor did not stop at my denial, as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Other rumors involving you do not stop at a mere few. And not just limited to those within the school, as you seem to be making quite the rounds. Well, of course, most of them, as you say yourself, are likely misunderstandings or exaggerations-----but it is enough for me that you are a person that causes such numerous rumors, such misunderstandings, such exaggerations."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are, interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine shut her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are... truly, interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh huh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">She even said it twice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are, truly interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You do not need to say it three times…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. you know. I cannot forgive this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cannot forgive?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What can you not forgive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" That a human as interesting as you has no relation whatsoever to my life ------it is utterly unforgivable. I want you to have some sort of bond with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, uh huh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wow.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have been given many evaluations by many di erent sorts of people, but this was the first time someone had ever been so blunt with me. Ahh…. no, to be precise just once before, six years ago, by Kunagisa's big brother, by Kunagisa Nao-san, albeit nuanced in a completely opposite way, I was told something similar. However, even so, I must admit it feels di erent to be told this by a lady rather than a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And yet, when I took a look, you were not registered for my class. And based on the classes you are taking, it did not feel as though you would register even after this year. At this rate, despite being on the same campus at the same time as this Kigamine Yaku, you would, without coming even close to brushing paths, leave this campus. No, in your case, you live a lifestyle that would not make it surprising if you were to drop out at the start of next year. After all, you do not seem particularly passionate about classes, anyways. I couldn't stand for this. I will not acknowledge such destiny."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will not acknowledge…."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Destiny exists . However, that destiny is one that you create for yourself .</p>
<p class="null-p">That is why I called out to meet you today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I understand what she is trying to say, but how should I put it, she expresses it with such extravagance. If she were to say it normally instead of in such a bizarre way, it would sound a bit more bizarre, I think.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I agree that I skip out on classes a bit, but I do not know how to reply to this so suddenly…. to be honest, I can only answer that you are overestimating me. There is nothing to be had by hanging around me. Although I admit I get dragged into problems quite often."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is my decision as to whether I am overestimating you or not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">This person really does not listen to others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Feels pointless to say anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are interesting, but I myself am quite interesting, if I may say so myself. From that perspective, I do not think it a bad deal for you to become acquainted with me, either. How does that sound?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How does that sound…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And in that vein, with regards to a certain allotted period of time, I would like for you to assist me in my research. I would be thrilled if you could consider it a part-time job over the summer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. a part-time job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, a part-time job. A part-time job. A paaaaaart, tiiiiiime, job. What a convenient phrase. Like…. well, that aside, I will pay you a worthy sum, of course. How about 200 dollars a day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. how many days?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A week, continuously."</p>
<p class="null-p">One week…. in other words, an influx of 1,400 dollars.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm, suddenly this conversation had taken a pragmatic, realistic twist. 1,400, for one week, is not too bad. I had at some point become in charge of quite a sum of money, but I had also used a significant amount of it on Hime-chan's academic fees, and had arrived at a standard of living much like that of your average, poor student, and as a result I could only look upon the o ered sum with a grateful eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, however.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. assisting your research…. while I cannot say that I had never partaken in such activities abroad…. Experiments and such are not my area of expertise. If anything, my speciality is thinking inside my head." "I had already predicted beforehand that you would gently turn down my o er in such a way," nodded assistant professor Kigamine. "However, as I have come this far, I will not simply nod and stand down. It would not be too late to respond after hearing a bit more, would it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or rather, assistant professor Kigamine. That sort of specialized research already has its own allocated sta , does it not? I cannot imagine you would be allowed to hire an outsider like myself merely because you want to become acquainted."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Merely because I want to become acquainted…. merely. Merely merely merely. Meeeeee, reeee, lyyyy. Fufu, you make it sound so pleasant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it pleasant?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In any case, my research has no sta . I request assistance every now and then, but in general I alone…. well, no. To be precise, there is always one more helper at all times, but their circumstance cannot be described as being sta ."</p>
<p class="null-p">" One ….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was said with a meaningful emphasis.</p>
<p class="null-p">It bothered me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That aside, I understand fully your concerns, but in this case, more than experimentation or field work, I mean for an even higher level, confirmation of results sort of help. If anything, I prefer for an outsider, a non-specialist in this field to be giving me a hand. In other words, what I want is not sta but a monitor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Monitor…. ah, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Confirmation of results. Then I can nod my head in understanding of the relatively high pay. She is no longer in the position of caring about the remaining budget. Although relevant to just a sliver of university research, there exist many important projects that would impact human society greatly. I had seen plenty of examples during my stay at the ER3. "It will be from Sunday, August 21st to Sunday the 28th. By that time, the cast on your left arm should be o , and you should be fully healed, correct? I do not intend for you to be performing menial labor, but you will be coming inside Takatsu University…. is what I would like to say, but pardon me, you will be coming to my somewhat di cult-to-reach private laboratory. Upstream Kamogawa, climb over one or two mountains, and then at the foothills…. or just about. It should be from nine in the morning to about six in the evening, but I would like for you to understand that the ending time may very well be extended. There are no buses nor trains from town, so if you could drive a car. Do you have a car? OK. Then of course, I shall pay for fuel. A little over twenty for each day, round-trip. And then, you may be asked to stay the night some days. In that case, I shall pay you extra for each night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, w- wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">All of a sudden, she began speaking under the premise that I had accepted. It was not like I was being sucked into her pace during the conversation, but rather that she was the "my pace" type that completely ignored other people. There is nothing more di cult than keeping up with a self-centered intellectual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To date, I have generally gone with the direction of turning down such o ers. I must apologize."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. such o ers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Picking up from our earlier conversation, the May incident. I refer to that when I say I have gone through some rough times tagging along with people."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was not being completely truthful, but I also did not feel obligated to explain in detail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you are being wary…. if I understand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Frankly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does the title, assistant professor, Takatsu University Human Biological</p>
<p class="null-p">Studies not provide any insurance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am not very comfortable with…. titles."</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially because a lot happened last month.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm," Assistant Professor nodded, pausing for a bit. "Stubborn.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assertive, for a youngster these days. Even though you look timid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, thank you…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hey, wait.</p>
<p class="null-p">She just casually insulted me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you are asking for higher pay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I am not.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am not, at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about 300 a day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah."</p>
<p class="null-p">The total went over 2000.</p>
<p class="null-p">Way too tempting.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the moment, my sources of income were being a part-time tutor to the three middle/high-school students, including Hime-chan, and helping Aikawa-san with her job every so often. The tutoring made for a decent income, but if I were to really break even, I would have to tutor way more people. Helping Aikawa-san made for good money, but it was always with my life on the line.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was worth pondering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"300 a day is still low, you say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, um, that was not what I meant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do not mind. I do not dislike youngsters who do not undersell themselves," Assistant Professor Kigamine chuckled like a villain. "Then, allow me to unveil my limit. 500 a day. That is my limit after taking your cost performance into account."</p>
<p class="null-p">"500…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Would mean, a total payment of 3,500….</p>
<p class="null-p">How many hundreds is 3,500?</p>
<p class="null-p">At that point, wariness takes over. I do not wish to believe happenings like the Shadou Kyouichirou Research Facility last month roll around everywhere, but I wonder about illegal experiments….</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite that, this was su cient to make me understand just how much Assistant Professor Kigamine required me. I do not understand why, but this Assistant Professor Kigamine was quite infatuated with me. Hmmmm…. that said, I feel like my tendency to attract weirdos was growing stronger by the day. Although if someone were to say you reap what you sow, I would have to agree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is still di cult for me to give an immediate answer," I said after contemplating. "However, I have begun to think it would be alright to respond after learning more details."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. Then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine took an A4 envelope from the bag that she had placed on the seat next to her, and handed it to me. It was sealed tightly, and it seemed it would be di cult to open it on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please take a look over these papers. It is a rough outline, but it explains what my research entails, and what I would like for you to help me with.</p>
<p class="null-p">And…. if you would be willing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you could gather a few more people who would be willing monitors. I would prefer for monitors for this cycle to be completely unrelated to myself, so I cannot go out and gather people. Surely you have a few friends who you can trust?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. guha."</p>
<p class="null-p">I winced.</p>
<p class="null-p">H…. how could she say that? This person. T…. that. That was the one thing that could not be used with regards to a person like myself. In other words, it was taboo. Friends who I can trust…. that….. that….</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will pay them individually as well, but of course I cannot a ord to value them the same as you. The fee I pay for you includes the physical directive to warp destiny, so in this case, yes, accounting for what I am o ering you, I would be able to pay 120 per day for each. That is still fairly high is it not? Of course, I am receptive to bargaining, but I am also not demanding heavy labor, so it would be problematic if they were to ask for more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A few…. how many are you wanting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Two, or three at most. My laboratory itself is not very spacious, so it would be problematic if many were to come. And I do have a budgetary limit. My patron is not that wealthy. So…." and then Assistant Professor Kigamine looked at the</p>
<p class="null-p">Omega watch on her right arm, which I presumed was intended for men. "This puts us at a good spot to end. If you are willing to give me a good answer, I can wait a week, so please e-mail me at any time. My address is on the business card I handed you at the start."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I cannot send e-mails."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked at me as if she were looking at a barbarian.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shit, don't think everyone has a computer. Is a cell phone that can't send e-mails that rare? These have their pros, you know.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does that mean that you are not well-versed in things like…. computers? I thought you were specializing in Information Technology at Rokumeikan</p>
<p class="null-p">University."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…. do you require such skills for your work?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, to the extent that it is not bothersome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can fulfill classwork fairly easily. I cannot send e-mail because of, shall we say, household reasons, or shall I say personal reasons. I did learn such things at the ER3, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. Then, I am relieved," Assistant Professor Kigamine said. "Then, I do not mind giving me a call. The time does not matter, be it morning or noon or late night. However, I am busy myself, and so you would be leaving a message in most cases. If you could give me a ring, I will call you back.</p>
<p class="null-p">How does that sound?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, until next time…. if we have a connection."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that farewell phrase, the Assistant Professor elegantly stood from her seat. Her slender stylishness was magnified when she stood. Indeed, as Mikoko-chan said, the way she acted, the sort of aura around her, had that feminine coolness to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However----even so, even after acknowledging all that, if I may say one word -- her coolness was far from being describable as seductive or alluring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, that was just the first impression.</p>
<p class="null-p">At some definitive point, Assistant Professor Kigamine was completely lacking in humanity. Even after conversing with her in person as I had just been doing, I was truly given the impression that I was speaking to a computer. I would even compare it to talking to a cyborg. Such a supposition was of course extremely rude; however, yes, the more I think about it, she seemed o as a human.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took the business card she had given me in the beginning from my pocket, and looked at it again. Assistant professor , Takatsu University Human Biological Studies . Professor , Anthropology . Professor , Biology . Dr. KIGAMINE YAKU . And then her laboratory phone number, her personal website, and her e-mail address (using the domain ac.jp).</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, it was definitely a business card for work.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Biology professor….</p>
<p class="null-p">I called out to Assistant Professor Kigamine as she left.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um…. if I may ask a question?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go right ahead," Assistant Professor Kigamine turned. "I had already predicted beforehand that you would ask me a question at the very, very end like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. specifically, what are you researching, Assistant Professor Kigamine?" "You would understand the general gist by looking at the contents of that envelope…. but yes. My research could be called a rebellion against cause and e ect. A revolution against the existent destiny, a declaration of independence that sets up camp against the oncoming absolute. But without ornamentation, you would call it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine answered simply.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without any emphasis, without any hidden meaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without any particular emotion, without any rousing feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">She answered, simply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----researching not dying."</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">It may seem di cult to imagine for those who have never done it themselves, and perhaps this is something tough to explain, but the walk from Kyoto's Shijo Kawara to Senbon Nakadachiuri does not require that much stamina. If anything, you could call it the perfect scenario for taking an absent-minded walk. It is, after all, the perfect distance for taking a stroll deep in thought. Well, granted most of the reason that I walked was because taking public transport, like rail or bus was di cult with my arm in a cast, but that is that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet still, for the duration of the roughly one-hour walk, I struggled to come to an answer with regards to Assistant</p>
<p class="null-p">Professor Kigamine's invitation. It did not seem too great a scale a conversation, and it did not seem like an event that would go awry, but if I were to reflect on how often I have casually said sure and tagged along and found myself mired in tragedy, I felt that the decision to tread lightly around the sleeping boar seemed the best choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">However….</p>
<p class="null-p">Personally, I could not deny my curiosity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Researching not dying .</p>
<p class="null-p">Not dying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if living, not dying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">That is, an amazing thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Romance.</p>
<p class="null-p">SF.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mystery.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fantasy.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's, entertainment.</p>
<p class="null-p">In total, absurd.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the same as if one were to say one were researching alchemy. Does academia these days accept such research? At the very least, it would be impossible in public…. and even if it were done behind closed doors, public universities would not be able to boldly proclaim their opposition to realism. Mm.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, that is why. Maybe that is why she is not researching within campus grounds? At the very least it is not a public, or publicly acceptable endeavor…. I do not know.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I guess I cannot know without reading this thing…." I am not one to walk around with a bag, so I carried the envelope in my right hand. I glanced at it, but I do not have any clairvoyance skills, so all i could see was the mere envelope, and not its contents. "However, this is getting boring."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having returned near the antique apartment I had inhabited since February, my eyes wandered to the garage that</p>
<p class="null-p">housed the Vespa (a white vintage model) I was gifted from Mikoko-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were two faces I recognized.</p>
<p class="null-p">One was Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other one was Miiko-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stopped my legs and looked at them. I wondered what they were doing under this blazing sun, and found that they were absorbed in playing kendama. The red ball a xed with string sliced through the air. Come to think of it, having been hounded by Hime-chan, I bought one at Osaka's Tokyu Hands….</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miiko-saaan."</p>
<p class="null-p">I raised my voice as I invaded the fenced garage. Miiko-san and Hime-chan noticed me and turned to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, Inoji." "Ah, Master-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san was yet again in her jinbei. However, it was after all August in Kyoto, in the dead of summer, in the heat of the most powerful of summers, so she had taken o her jacket, and tied it around her waist. Her healthy shoulders were emphasized by the black tank-top, and it was a bit blinding. The steel fan I had gifted her some days earlier was sheathed away by her hip. Her samurai-like ponytail, and that cool expressionless-ness that remained unchanged by the heat.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for Hime-chan, she seemed to have just returned from school as she wore a sailor uniform (although it was summer vacation, she was such a studious student that she was forced to go in for supplementary classes every day). And a giant yellow ribbon. She was looking at me, yet the kendama ball landed at the end of the sword like it was drawn by gravity. Hmm, as you might expect of the apprentice of the former Zig Zag, Shisei Yuma, she seemed quite skilled when it came to playing with things that involved a needle and string .</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master-. Where were you today?" Hime-chan trotted over by my side. It was like watching a puppy. "Ooh, that envelope looks pretty suspicious!" "Nothing much. Please refrain from flaunting your strangely precise instincts. It is nothing that Hime-chan needs worry about," I lightly warded</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan o , and turned to Miiko-san. "Good day, Miiko-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san nodded, lightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She just nodded, and returned her attention to the kendama.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pfoosh………………………………………………………………... clank, thud, phwip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inoji, can you do it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh, well, I did play it a bit as a kid."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san handed me her kendama. I looked at the red ball, and noticed that even though I had only bought it for her a few days ago, it was scratched all over. I stole a glance at the kendama held by Hime-chan. Her ball was hardly even touched, as pretty as new.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">First, I tried to put the ball back on the dish.</p>
<p class="null-p">I bent my knees to act as a cushion, and succeeded.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, next….</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san made a sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was so shocked that I let the ball fall back out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. what is it…. you surprised me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fantastic…. you succeeded on your first try."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, um, that was just setting up…."</p>
<p class="null-p">It is harder to not be able to do this.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hard part about kendama is placing the sword through the ball, right? "Hmm…. if Inoji can do it, then wouldn't it mean there is an underhanded contraption in the kendama itself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It says Japanese kendama Association here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. mmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san furrowed her brows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humiliating…. there should be nothing in the world with a sword that I cannot handle…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. that sounds pretty ridiculous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mii-nee-san is surprisingly clumsy-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan cackled. And as she cackled, she made the kendama ball go CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK CLANK around the world, and then with a fwip extended the kendama itself with centrifugal force, sliding the sword into the hole. "Yay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. splendid."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Contrary to her dull-looking appearance, this girl was extremely deft with her fingertips. She could play eight kendamas at once. She was small, but as if she were made inversely proportionally, her fingers were extremely long. "Is there like a trick to it?" Miiko-san asked me. "Hime has been teaching me a lot, but I have not improved one bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. No matter what Hime-chan says, Mii-nee-san just becomes lewd."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">While I would very much welcome Miiko-san becoming lewd, I must point out for her sake that Hime-chan meant confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A trick…. but this is just placing it on the dish. Even when it comes to sliding it on the sword, you just have to twist the ball like this, and it is simple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's cheating," Hime-chan heckled. "You can't teach her the easy way out like that. Once people learn the easy way out, it becomes a habit. And then you can't expect them to improve anymore. People are growing Asimov!" "Those are wonderful words."</p>
<p class="null-p">I grabbed Hime-chan by her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let us put those words into practice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nyagi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Instead of playing around like this, go study."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nyagiiiii."</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that primal voice, Hime-chan slumped over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come, come. Hurry up and go put the Three Laws of Robotics into practice." It was not as though Asimov was himself a robot, but I felt like jumping aboard her mistake. "First, you must always follow your Master's orders."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Studying is boringggg. Boring boring boring."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how many times you repeat boring, nothing will ever change." "How would you know that? Something might happen and make things happen. Why do you always reject people outright like that? Jeez, this</p>
<p class="null-p">Master always makes me lose the will to go on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh stop with the sophism…. geez, I do not know why, but you have suddenly only improved at talking rubbish."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Definitely your fault."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san said, spinning her kendama sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm, that may be so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master-. Hime-chan, just now, and I mean so just now, so much that it wouldn't be a lie to say just one second ago, Hime-chan just came back from school. Like a brave hero that just returned alive from the hellish supplementary classes. Why can't I play around a bit? It's like a warrior's break time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Warriors have no time for rest! Once people learn the easy way out, it becomes a habit. And then you can't expect them to improve anymore. Now, go ahead!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umiii... Master is always obfuscated!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"While I accept your opinion with some validity, Hime-chan, you should stop forcing yourself to use di cult words."</p>
<p class="null-p">Obfuscated → × Obnoxious → ○</p>
<p class="null-p">They are not even close.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say so," Hime-chan nodded, bored. "Well then, Mii-nee-san, thanks for playing with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm? Hmm? Uhh, sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san unnaturally nodded. To her, she probably had not played with her so much as they were playing together , or perhaps she might even have taken it as Hime-chan playing along with her . She was a bit childish in that sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bleeeh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan stuck out her tongue, and with kendama in hand ran from the parking lot. Filled with energy, she disappeared from our sight quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seventeen.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, when I was seventeen, I was not that lively…. I feel like I was a di erent sort of sunk, a sort of person lacking life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not that I want to remember.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're pretty mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san said from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no need to force her to study like that. When I was her age I was a twisted fool, a small brat. Compared to that, Hime's a straightforward, good girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the livelihood of a student is studying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You hardly go to classes yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are free once you get to university."</p>
<p class="null-p">That said, let it remain secret that I had simply warded Hime-chan o so I could be together with Miiko-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh. I wanted to play with her a bit more, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh, that was what she meant by mean .</p>
<p class="null-p">What a child.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Come to think of it, Miiko-san, do you not usually have a part-time job at this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asano Miiko, twenty-two years old, part-time worker.</p>
<p class="null-p">She made a living by bouncing around various part-time jobs and teaching neighborhood kids swordsmanship. While one would think she does not have that many expenses as someone living alone, she was passionate about collecting antiques, and it had become less a hobby and more a pastime, so I had the impression of her as someone that fretted mightily over income.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, part-time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was fired yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">And as carefreely as she would as passing greeting, she continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I clashed with a customer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh huh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have been working at a bar this time. Perhaps there was a rowdy customer…. Miiko-san may look like an aloof, quiet, wise person, but she was actually a quick-tempered type.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I need to get a grip…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are apologetic, after all…."</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the third time she was fired for the same reason. It is true that people cannot so easily change even if they understand their wrongs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I need to find my next job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">I glanced at my envelope.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part-time. Work. Source of income.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though they all mean the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even in such a circumstance, I cannot drag Miiko-san into this suspicious job….</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's living expenses of course, but there's also the matter of the hanging scroll I found last month…. I need to pay for it by the end of this month, so I'm in a bit of a mess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is reserved, for now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More-or-less."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And how much is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"14,000."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….. wow."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even among the antiques that Miiko-san cycled through as she bought, then sold, then bought with the money she received, then sold again, that number stood out. Simple antiques cycling would not catch up to that amount so easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How far o are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About 2,000. I was hoping to make up that money this month, but I was just fired from the job I was the most depending on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kyoto is a tough city to find part-time work in, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. do you really want it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm. It's an authentic from an artist I like."</p>
<p class="null-p">An authentic.</p>
<p class="null-p">How luxurious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that seller trustworthy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I saw the expert's proof."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">2,000…. even if I were to accept Assistant Professor Kigamine's o er, she would still not reach that sum. I would receive a total of 3,500, but everyone else would receive a total of 840. Well, the deadline is the end of August, so she could fill the gap with other part-time work, or perhaps….</p>
<p class="null-p">But, you know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not want to drag Miiko-san into unnecessary things. Although if this were Nanananami, I would not hesitate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san's interest returned to the kendama. As I had suggested earlier, she spun the ball hanging from the string and tried to land it on the dish. While it landed on the dish for a moment, the momentum and spin made it fall back o . …. I wondered why she wanted to spin it onto the dish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muuu. Even though it's a sword…. even though it's a sword."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not that that has anything to do with it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I clumsy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe it is more to do with personality. Miiko-san does not seem the type to be suited to playing with compact trinkets."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Compact. But I think it's fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san was able to state that something she was poor at was fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Frankly, I thought that admirable.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I were a person with any bit of composure, I may have thought I would like to pick up that trait from her. At the very least, even the way I am now, I felt like I wanted to follow her example.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. It's on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You did it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The first time she was able to land the ball on the dish….</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she truly is clumsy, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or perhaps a natural-born hard-worker.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I hope she treasures her trait well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I will return to my room as well. Are you free tonight? If you are, would you like to have dinner together? I can treat you to meat, to help you forget about your job loss."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfortunately, I have plans tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">How terribly unfortunate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Inoji," Miiko-san snapped the kendama ball from the air. At the very least, she did not look like she lacked reflexes or hand-eye coordination. "Apologies if I'm being noisy about this. But about that thing in your room, Inoji, how long are you going to leave that thing in your room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to poke my nose into personal a airs, but this room has three underage kids in Hime and Moe and Hou. I think that thing causes a bit of a developmental problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am technically still underage too," I jokingly shrugged. "Well, you are right. Yes, eventually, I will do something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eventually."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When it comes to that thing at least, it is partly my responsibility that things turned out this way, so it is a bit di cult to handle. That said, for now, there is no likelihood of problems that would bother Miiko-san, so please rest easy on that end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ok. I'll trust you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then."</p>
<p class="null-p">I flippantly raised my hand, and when I had turned my back to her, I heard the sounds of the kendama resume. It seemed Miiko-san was quite enamored by such play. That said, kendamas are normally an indoors play, so I wondered why she had bothered to walk all the way out to the parking lot…. well, I suppose that four-tatami apartment lacks the space for even beanbags, much less kendamas.</p>
<p class="null-p">Four-tatami space, tatami-matted, with bare light bulbs.</p>
<p class="null-p">No bath, a shared bathroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nowadays you would not normally imagine such a horrible living conditions existing, but the people living in this apartment are truly unique, and so being here is amusing, and very pleasant, I think. Along with the swordsman Asano Miiko-san, that old man I finally found out the real name of, Hayabusa Koutoumaru, the ran-from-home siblings Ishinagi Moeta and Yamiguchi Houko-chan, the worst witch, Nanananami Nanami, and the Zig Zag apprentice, Yukariki Ichihime. When placed alongside such characters, this very ordinary user of nonsense simply fades into the background.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without a doubt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Exceedingly and interminably.</p>
<p class="null-p">Essentially and unmistakably.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you allow me to sum it up in one word.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it is nonsense…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I arrived at the apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wooden and three-storied.</p>
<p class="null-p">I climbed the stairs to the second floor, and passed by my neighbor</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san's room, and opened the door to my room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome home, Master."</p>
<p class="null-p">I opened the door and was immediately greeted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I longed greatly for your return. I recognize and understand the fatigue felt by the Master of the House and so I shall do my utmost best to relieve your burden. Will you have dinner or will you have a bath? Or perhaps will you have me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Among the lines in this world that number as many as the stars, I was given the one that would cause the most mental damage. I could not even fathom a response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you look so stunned, Master?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing an apron and displaying obedient behavior, yet undone by that cool, intellectual expression and the shoulder-length hair. She smiled faintly, but it looked nothing short of fake. When it comes to di cult of measuring temperature, I thought back to Assistant Professor Kigamine, but if Assistant Professor Kigamine were like a robotic, cold iron, this one was like pleasant, cold water.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her name is Kasugai Kasuga.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai Kasuga.</p>
<p class="null-p">A animal scientist that specializes in animal physiology and animal psychology, a biologist---in other words, she did not only share temperature vector with Assistant Professor Kigamine-----that until last month worked at the Shadou Kyouichirou Research Facility deep in the mountains of the Aichi Prefecture.</p>
<p class="null-p">I say that in past tense because, obviously, it no longer held true.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last month, Professor Shadou Kyouichirou, he who held the alias Mad Demon , and his research facility essentially collapsed. At the same time, that meant she lost her job, and because she lived at the job, her home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I jest. A playful big sister's jest. Don't look so seriously scared. How cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for why that Kasugai-san is here. If I am to explain why she traded her lab coat for an apron.</p>
<p class="null-p">----here is the flashback.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yahoo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. how did you find where I live."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I looked it up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. how did you get from Aichi to Kyoto."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I walked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beginning today, this is where I live."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was fired and have become freely unemployed because of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was fired and have become freely unemployed because of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……well, that might, be true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this rate my life as a lady is at risk of ending. I would be happy if you could display some manly chivalry spirit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….no."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. A shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are quite quick to give up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh ahh. I even prepared a maid uniform and everything but it has all gone to waste. A shame, a shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then bye bye. Until we meet again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't say anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you did. Say it again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I even prepared a maid uniform and everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...please, make yourself at home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Neither seek nor shun the fight, oppress the strong and assist the weak, you would not think that I would not lend a hand to a person in need."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all, not at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">----end flashback.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, all of that might be a joke or a lie so it would be bothersome if you believed all of it, but the truth might not be much di erent, or perhaps not.</p>
<p class="null-p">This marked the end of week one of living with Kasugai Kasuga-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't just stand there come in. It's your home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san waved me forward in invitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The end of week one of living together.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was gaining composure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, screw composure, this was the sort of person she always was. Although I dare not borrow assistant professor Kigamine's words, while my first impression of her was among the worst possible because of the circumstance of our meeting, having allowed her uniqueness shine through experiencing a slice of life together, I could say that it is very rare to run across someone as interesting as this Kasugai Kasuga. She was so interesting that I felt like I had lost my chance to kick her out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes yes…. will you cut it out with those jokes. After all, there is no bath or food. This room does not even have a refrigerator."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yet surprisingly we do have food. I ordered delivery. And sushi, at that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I received some special income."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is to thank you for housing me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh huh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">That is quite an unexpected and kind act of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Special income, did that mean she had found a place to work?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now come in, come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, alright…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to the bucket of sushi lay a girl wearing a manteau.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does it not look delicious? I asked Koutoumaru-san for recommendations for stores around here. Actually I took a bite earlier myself and found it to be quite delicious. You cannot drink so we cannot have a toast but I did prepare some Oolong tea. This is called Red Oolong--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kasugai-sAn."</p>
<p class="null-p">My voice sounded awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Awkward!</p>
<p class="null-p">Awkward awkward!</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it all of a sudden?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This Girl, wHo is She?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt like I was talking like a space alien.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Well I'll explain that in a bit so let's leave it aside for now. It is better to focus on grabbing some sushi first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is not better."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not better at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could stake my whole existence on that.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl covered in a black manteau was small, and seemed to be asleep. If I focused my ears I could even hear her cute sleeping breath. Even standing this far away I could tell her black hair was grown extremely long. I would say something about her sleeping with her glasses still on, but she slept peacefully nonetheless.</p>
<p class="null-p">A cute face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably around seventeen, just like Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, underaged.</p>
<p class="null-p">Underaged, in other words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Underaged kidnapping!</p>
<p class="null-p">Kidnapping, and imprisoning!</p>
<p class="null-p">And it being a girl made it fatal!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dark clouds…. great dark clouds hanging over my life…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh…. I can even see the Alcor star.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, actually I cannot see anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do not say such accusatory things. You make me pout," Kasugai-san folded her arms and sounded genuinely insulted. "I helped a person out. When I was taking a walk I found that girl collapsed by the side of the road, so I picked her up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Collapsed…. picked her up….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san answered, matter-of-factly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she went ahead and sat down on the tatami, crossed her legs, and reached over to grab sushi. She popped one into her mouth, exhaled, and briefly had a blushed expression. She is strange, but her appetite, at least, was first-class.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just her appetite, anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, what about her common sense?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha- what are you thinking!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you mad about? I mean you're the one that's making no sense and being unreasonable. What was wrong with what I did? Or are you saying that you could ignore someone collapsed on the ground and go on your merry way? That you can walk along without helping a poor little girl?</p>
<p class="null-p">That'd be quite the human failure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……...guh."</p>
<p class="null-p">I never imagined being told something correct by someone wrong could be so irritating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now let's hurry up and eat sushi. All the egg ones are mine. Hmm? What's that envelope? It smells quite interesting…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please stop trying to progress the story while ignoring such an important event! Like 'world domination, only if the world were a village of a hundred'</p>
<p class="null-p">!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was so flustered I had a Mikoko-chan moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The police! The police the police, with prompt decision and prompt execution and prompt immediacy, please call the police! We currently have a vehement need of the police!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh please. Don't make it sound like I'm a person with no common sense." Tsk tsk tsk, went Kasugai-san as she waved a finger. Perhaps someone might seriously call me short-tempered, but right now, each and every motion by this person seems to irritate me further. Ahh -- I knew it, I knew this person would one day screw something up…. I knew it, so why did I let her talk me into this? Was living together with a beautiful lady that tempting to be willing to risk the rest of my life? There has been almost nothing good to come of this past week. All that happened was that my already-small room had become divided in half!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, life is full of surprises. And it doesn't always go the way you'd like."</p>
<p class="null-p">The exact person not letting things go my way decided to placate me. "Hmm, alright. Then, big sis will o er a bit of advice to the young worried boy. What do you get when you write problem( 困 り ご と) with preparing( 備 える) and heart( 心)? " "What do you get?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Distress( 困 憊)! "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sense some distress in your eyes ☆"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop with the ☆!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This was that girl's one belonging," said Kasugai-san as she deftly stood up, changed the subjects. and pulled out a wallet. It was clearly one meant for a child, given the fancy animal character (perhaps an anime character) inked onto the vinyl surface. Kasugai-san unzipped it and pulled out a piece of paper. It was a business card.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here look at this."</p>
<p class="null-p">The business card read:</p>
<p class="null-p">Great Detective</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Rizumu</p>
<p class="null-p">NEONOMIYA RHYTHM</p>
<p class="null-p">And then an address and phone number (land / FAX / mobile).</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like, baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, is there anything you can say as to why it was wrong for me to not carry this girl o to the police, or perhaps you can't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Irony…"</p>
<p class="null-p">No, irony is totally irrelevant in this case.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem is the profession written on that business card with a round hamster illustration and purikura stickers plastered all over the back of it, like it had been created at an arcade.</p>
<p class="null-p">Great Detective.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Who cares about some biology professor.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is even rarer than Nessie.</p>
<p class="null-p">More unidentified than an UFO.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hyakki Yako like the identity of a ghost!</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it has been completed…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And a bishoujo great detective," Kasugai-san continued. "Bishoujo great detective. Bishoujo great detective. Right? How could you possibly sell o a girl so amusing to police influence?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that is your reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that said, leaving her reason aside, it was indeed di cult to call her decision wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">A (self-described) great detective wearing a manteau.</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely and utterly a suspicious character, undeniably unidentified, and certainly public enemy number one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are right…. a great detective surely must have a black manteau…." I was so flustered I began babbling without purpose. "However, why does that mean you needed to bring her into my room, Kasugai-san?" "Because. I came all the way to Kyoto because I thought being with you would be amusing but all you're doing is living a daily life. It's so boring watching you work as a tutor and fall in love with Asano-san and have little spats with Ichihime-chan. So I decided to bring in some trouble." "I see, now that I know what you are up to, please shut that mouth and be quiet."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then choke to death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Murderous intent.</p>
<p class="null-p">This emotion bubbling up in me must certainly be murderous intent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope she is not sick…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I kneeled down by the girl and placed a hand on her forehead. It was a bit hot, but all girls this age are like that, so this was probably normal. I thought about taking her pulse, but her arms were both inside her manteau. It cannot be helped then, I cannot just take o her clothes. I touched the vessels in her neck. Thump thump thump thump. Looks perfectly healthy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I already performed those ordinary checks. That girl is really….</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan is really just sleeping. I am a biology professor after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up, Miss Unemployed."</p>
<p class="null-p">I tried telling o an older woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan, eh….</p>
<p class="null-p">A strange name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is her surname that…. Neonomiya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably romanized o the kanji, pronounced like Niounomiya."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, Niounomiya…." I withdrew my hand from Rizumu-chan. "I feel like</p>
<p class="null-p">I have heard the name before…. But where…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tut tut, you're a university student but you really know nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya comes up in the Tale of Genji. Even I know that despite being a science professor. One of the largest stories spanning 54 chapters. And of those the first arc began with The Paulownia Pavillon and ended with Vanished in the Clouds . Although of course because Vanished in the Clouds did not actually exist the arc actually ended at The Seer with Vanished in the Clouds being a notifier to the reader about the protagonist's death. And then the second arc sandwiching Vanished in the Clouds . From The Maiden of the Bridge to the final chapter The Floating Bridge of Dreams is called the Ten Uji Chapters and includes the volumes The Perfumed Prince, Red Plum Blossoms and Bamboo River . Nioumiya is the name of the protagonist's nephew."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew I had heard the name somewhere. This answers that question without any doubt whatsoever. How nostalgic, when was the last time I read the Tale of Genji? That is right, back in the ER3 days. I read the English version for a class. This makes me run against the grain, but personally I preferred the after stories over the first arc. It felt more like an aftermath, like they were cleaning up afterwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Ikki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...What is that nickname."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ikki," I was ignored. "Are you not going to look under her manteau?" "Not going to look…. please do not treat me like some pervert. And you know, I am not particularly interested in little girls. In fact I think it is something else to be drawn to younger girls once you become 19 years ol--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think your odds with Asano-san are slim though."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said it so clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit shocked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you should check out what's under Rizumu-chan's manteau because it's amusing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amusing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Very very amusing. The biggest reason why I picked up that girl is actually under her manteau."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt like I was being tricked, but I fearfully lifted the innocent-looking girl's black manteau and peeked under. If someone were to take a photo of this scene, my life would be over.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing a straitjacket.</p>
<p class="null-p">You know the one that people recognize as the one Hannibal Lecter wore, the one for extremely dangerous criminals on death row, the one with no sense of sexuality. Her sleeves were crossed in front of her chest as part of the clothing, and even then they were tied by two leather belts, and probably because the size did not fit her, the sleeves were too</p>
<p class="null-p">long, and she wore the rest of the straitjacket like a one-piece dress. Just a bit, just a bit if you really tried hard it could look like an oversized hoodie------no, you cannot. You absolutely cannot.</p>
<p class="null-p">I put the manteau back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">I am so done.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just way, way too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have lived nineteen-and-a-half years to date, and have experienced all sorts of trials and tribulations, but I have never experienced being in such a pinch as this. This is without a doubt the first time in my life I have been cornered on the edge of a cli like this. I could feel the urge rising to accept the next time the Wet Crow's Feather Island gave me one of their at-least-twice-a-month calls inviting me back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leaving the manteau aside, how can you even take her pulse like this…." "I wonder if this sort of fashion is trending with young girls these days. My my, I am getting old. Does this fall under goth-loli? Death metal? Punk?" "Can you really call something fashion if you cannot wear it without help…." and I do not think this falls under goth-loli nor death metal nor punk. It was obviously a real straitjacket. "I guess someone who's a great detective always has a screw loose, after all…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I earnestly thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess I have yet quite a ways to go in sharpening my senses…. "That said, perhap s Rizumu-chan isn't wearing that clothing of her own will," Kasugai-san suddenly began speaking in a stern, professor-like voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It may be child abuse."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. abuse."</p>
<p class="null-p">Child abuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Abuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words felt like cold steel.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the point where I did not want to imagine anything related.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. by who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By Ikki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyone looking at this scene would think the same."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shit.</p>
<p class="null-p">This person is too funny.</p>
<p class="null-p">A live-in biology scientist and a straitjacket girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could no longer decide what to be more confused about…. perhaps I should call Hime-chan for help…. wait, what point is there in adding more fools to the scene?</p>
<p class="null-p">Help, Mikoko-chan! Help, Shito-kun!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ikki is such a boring man," Kasugai-san sighed as she looked down on me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted you to play the straightman part out beautifully there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ikki is a boring man so you aren't allowed to say anything other than a straightman's line from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then I shall focus on being the straightman…. wait, why!?" I played the straightman once, and then. "…. wait, why, why!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You pass."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san gave me a thumbs up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keep at it and aim for Oogaki-kun's level."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you turned him into that…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai Kasuga's animal training lesson.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was when.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm…. mmmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">While we were fooling around, the girl, Rizumu-chan, turned over in her sleep. It looked like she might be awakening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu. This is your time to shine. What sort of excuse will Ikki come up with?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I will have to think about how to kick this person out later.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought maybe I should not be too close by when she awakened, so I slid away from Rizumu-chan. I saw that Kasugai-san was not moving from her current position, so I hid behind her. Kasugai-san was a bit taller than me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You coward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Call me what you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You child-abusing pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am not."</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Rizumu opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. mm. Nya."</p>
<p class="null-p">She raised her small body. She did it easily despite being unable to use her arms. And then Rizumu-chan looked in Kasugai-san (and my) direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she tilted her head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her large, black and white eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just stared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Purely inquisitive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">Weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suspicion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Caution.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuuuu---"</p>
<p class="null-p">She began winding up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U, ukyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A glass-shattering shriek.</p>
<p class="null-p">With tears, produced by scream!</p>
<p class="null-p">Shit! It's all over!</p>
<p class="null-p">This is where the User of Nonsense ends!</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you for reading!</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's, it's, it's sushi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for the meal!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With the force of a starved beast, Rizumu-chan began gorging on the platter of sushi. Without the use of her arms, she looked like a dog, but she ate with such ferocity that I could not even comment on how it was rude of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh! The egg are mine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san hurriedly shouted, after skipping a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that I think about it, this is the first time I have ever heard this person raise her voice….and that was when I finally thought, are you really using your savings on this?</p>
<p class="null-p">How wasteful….</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">I had nothing to do and nothing to say, and so I simply stood quietly and watched this manteau-wearing great detective and apron-wearing biology scientist fight over sushi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fade out.</p>
<p class="null-p">3</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Niounomiya Rizumu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan bowed her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan, myself, and Kasugai-san sat facing each other in a triangle. As we were in such a small room, it was like we were sitting at separate corners. Rizumu-chan had taken o her black manteau and folded it at the side of the room, and so now she was in only the one-piece straitjacket. Although it was evening, the Kyoto night was not particularly cool. Or rather, Kyoto feels much more like summer during the night. However, I also feel that it is cruel to place blame solely on Kyoto for the damp, overbearing air I currently su ocated in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sixteen years old! A great detective!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I am Kasugai Kasuga. A biology professor."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san answered without missing a beat, and extended her right hand. Rizumu-chan, with her arms strapped, simply smiled. It was an incredibly innocent smile, one that insinuated being out of touch with reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person is Ikki. A user of nonsense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do not just go ahead and introduce others."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan switched expressions and looked at us. I could almost sense a bit of weight behind that look, almost allowing me to nod my head at her self-proclaimed great detective-ness. If only she did not have so many grains of rice stuck around her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why am I in a place like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">…..but even if you asked me.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is a critical problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I would like to ask that, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">I would like to ask God.</p>
<p class="null-p">God, are you stupid?</p>
<p class="null-p">"My my, do not call it a place like this. After all, it is my home you know?" "It is not your home," I said. "Kasugai-san. You are simply complicating things, so please shut up for a while." "I want to make things complicated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up. I'll kill you." I looked away from Kasugai-san and faced Rizumu-chan. And then I used the high-level technique of lying without falsifying the truth. "As for the question of why you are here in a place like this…. well, that nice lady over there was not able to leave you alone lying around like that, and picked you up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lying around!" Rizumu-chan looked surprised. "W- where? Where was I lying around this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time?</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, means, there was a last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I cocked my head to the side and looked at Kasugai-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where was she lying around?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Below the bridge near Kamogawa Park."</p>
<p class="null-p">She answered. Saying Kamogawa Park did not narrow the area down any given its size, but that aside, that is quite the distance to go for a walk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I suppose the strange behavior of this person has quite some reach.</p>
<p class="null-p">She has nothing to do anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see I see," Rizumu-chan nodded in acceptance. "Well then, thank you very much! I love you, Onee-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And her graciousness was very friendly and intimate. But it was not bad feeling to see a girl filled with energy. This world has been filled with many sarcastic brats of late, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, it is nothing to thank me over. I simply did what is normal for a civilized human being," Kasugai-san said despite undoubtedly not thinking anything of the sort. She was most assuredly one of those sarcastic brats in her days.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, if I may ask, what sort of profession is a great detective?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she continued with a question for which she undoubtedly had no interest.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was obviously just having fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan proudly smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I would describe it as Mental Labor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san tried to sound amazed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It reeked of a blu .</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if I were to say one thing, a great detective isn't a profession,</p>
<p class="null-p">Onee-san, Onii-san. A great detective is a way of life!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan smiled, showing o .</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh no, she is an idiot.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said a way of life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's cool, very cool, very cool. A way of life. I admire those things,"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san was into this now, acting out a personality that made no sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, what is that straitja….. mgh."</p>
<p class="null-p">I hurriedly, with my body and soul, rushed over and smothered</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Phew, that was close.</p>
<p class="null-p">Idiot, how could you be asking such a pointed question so easily? How dense can you be? What happens if she truly were a victim of child abuse? What would you do then?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no nothing nothing. I just suddenly wanted to do a pro wrestling move…. hey, Kasugai-san, please do not lick my finger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I reflexively let Kasugai-san go. W- what is this feeling going through my body? All she did was lick my fingertip…. I ended up glaring at Kasugi-san, who in turn, stuck her tongue out through her thin lips, and then shot me a seductive look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Scary!</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai Kasuga, seriously scary!</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. umm. Now that we know where you were found knocked out, could you tell us why you were lying there? Was it related to being a detective?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not a detective, a great detective!" She corrected that slight di erence.</p>
<p class="null-p">She appears to have an odd fixation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now. As for why, yeah, I was probably starving. When I'm concentrating, I forget to eat. I was probably pretty wobbly because I hadn't eaten in three days."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">That explains her appetite.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, probably seems pretty vague."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I lose consciousness a lot. Habitually losing consciousness, or something? Sometimes I wake up in a place I don't recognize, in a town I don't recognize, and my memory is gone. It always happens."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….. huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That….</p>
<p class="null-p">That is pretty dangerous, is it not?</p>
<p class="null-p">Does that mean she has…. an illness?</p>
<p class="null-p">Nar- something, that sleepiness illness, that I forget the name of. "But this is the first time I woke up and found delicious sushi right in front of me. Jeez, thanks for the meal. I love sushi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no, think nothing of it," Kasugai-san matter-of-factly answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry about paying for it either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahah, lady, you're just as kind as you look. I love you! But I can't just accept that… ah, that reminds me!" Rizumu-chan stood up abruptly as if going gasp ! "My, my wallet is gone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be right here. It was in the pocket of your manteau,"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san handed her the wallet. I say handed, but Rizumu-chan grabbed it in her mouth. She must have -7 lifestyle points. "It was dangerous so I hung onto it. I know it's rude but I also wanted to know your name."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why thank you…. hey it's empty!" Rizumu-chan wailed. "Stolen again! There was 30,000 yen this time, too! Only coins and my business card are left!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Poor soul. It must have been stolen while you were knocked out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san said with an expression filled with sympathy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at the sushi platter that was as empty as the wallet. I confirmed the name of the store engraved with green.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm, this store, with this platter, with this amount, would be roughly</p>
<p class="null-p">30,000 yen….</p>
<p class="null-p">Special income.</p>
<p class="null-p">That meant a special source of income.</p>
<p class="null-p">Special as in not normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Are you a demon?</p>
<p class="null-p">I will say it however many times.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are you a demon!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"….well, I was able to eat some sushi, so I'll give up on that," said</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan even though she was clearly still a ected, and then she headed toward her folded manteau. "And because there is no need to stay, I thought I should begin my retreat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. huh. I wonder where to stay tonight…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stay, you mean you do not live around here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a wanderer from one journey to the next."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wanderer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Romanticist."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Come to think of it, the name on her business card was not something I recognized as being in Kyoto. I do not remember where that postal code was for, either. Given her profession (way of life) as a great detective, from one journey to the next must refer to being away from home often.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should divide risks if you are journeying. Like keeping at least three wallets on you. I did that while coming to Kyoto myself." Kasugai-san did not hesitate in o ering advice, as though she had experienced it herself. I will never again trust this person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Running out of funds in the middle of a trip is quite alarming.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Onii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I defaulted to a polite tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you put my manteau on me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Commenting is forbidden.</p>
<p class="null-p">I picked up the manteau, and like the top-class butler Sebastian (made-up name), I put the manteau back on Rizumu-chan. "Thank you," she bowed her head. Even after raising her head again, perhaps subconsciously, her back still dropped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pitiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was too pitiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was so pitiful, it was like the king of pitiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">More than anything, the lack of recognition of one's own pitiful state was what was definitively pitiful. These are the sorts of people that become abused by the powers that be in human society. "Huh? I can't find it anymore, oh well."</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">I could no longer contain my guilt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. Rizumu-chan. Do you want me to lend you some money?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan spun around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…. although I do not have much to spare."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you! Onii-san, I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thud!</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan charged into me for a hug. Obviously because she could not use her arms, it simply turned into a bodyslam. It was a surprisingly heavy blow, and as a result I crashed into the wall behind me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It kinda hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…..are you ok?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">I took my wallet out of my back pocket, and transferred 30,000 yen exactly to Rizumu-chan's wallet. While that constituted this month's living expenses, and while I was not living a particularly financially sound life, and while while while, I could not worry about that right now. I placed 30,000 yen in Rizumu-chan's manteau pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Rizumu-chan, you should not casually say you love people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because fondness leads to being taken advantage. Well of course, that is di erent if you yourself intend to take advantage of people that way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? …. yes. I don't really get it, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say such dark things to innocent girls, Ikki. This is why I hate realists," Kasugai-san spread her arms out and shook her head in an exaggerated motion, as if sighing and saying jeez, like a foreign host of a sales channel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">While I would normally agree with such an opinion, even so I could hold my head high knowing that I was a better human being than her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ok. Got it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And you should not be agreeing with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then well then well then, I am glad to have been in your care,</p>
<p class="null-p">Onii-san, Onee-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Feel free to stop by if you ever need help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm telling you to shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll still be in Kyoto for a while for work, so if we have a connection, let us meet again. I just arrived, so I still have to figure out a hotel and such, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. sure," I nodded. "If we have a connection."</p>
<p class="null-p">If we have a connection.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who said that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Right, Assistant Professor Kigamine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we meet again, I'll pay you back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, don't worry about that. You can forget we exist. That said, what do you mean by…. for work?" Was that not a way of life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kufufu-. Right now, I'm,"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looking for a man named Zerozaki Hitoshiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….." "…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's my mental labor right now. I'd like it if Onii-san or Onee-san called me at the number on that business card if you come across anything about</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki Hitoshiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In…. information…." I eeked out, stunned. "But without knowing what sort of person that is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you'll recognize him immediately. He has this super flamboyant tattoo on his face. Ah, but I don't think you'll run into him that easily. He's apparently really good at hiding. And he's dangerous, so you shouldn't raise your voice if you see him. Oh yeah, Onii-san, could you give me your contact info?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S, sure…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I instinctively gave Rizumu-chan my cell phone number.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. A good number."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What's wrong? That's an interesting expression."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nothing…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmkay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan bowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And with that, I shall take my leave. Farewell, Onii-san, Onee-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Energetic to the end, the self-proclaimed great detective, Niounomiya</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu formally bowed, shook her hand, and left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">All that remained was silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not even Kasugai-san said anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">I said nothing, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking for... Zerozaki Hitoshiki?</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking for, she said?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Zerozaki…." Kasugai-san mumbled after what felt like forever. "That was the name of the person who had infiltrated the Professor's facility last month…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…."</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki Hitoshiki is exactly the name of the serial murderer who had indiscriminately killed a total of twelve people in Kyoto in May.</p>
<p class="null-p">Could it be….</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not think I would encounter that name again in a circumstance like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Human Failure, Zerozaki Hitoshiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">The demonic child of the Zerozaki family.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sub-zero blade that murdered as easily as breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">>"…even so."</p>
<p class="null-p">I scratched my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no actual reason to be nervous. Even if she had come to Kyoto looking for him…. there is nothing to be done. I do not think he is in Kyoto anymore, much less even in Japan. Great Detective, rampaging.</p>
<p class="null-p">Would it have been better to tell her?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey…...Ikki."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san called my name with a solemn look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..what do you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I am full, the lady would like to do some erotic things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do it alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">August 1, a Monday.</p>
<p class="null-p">Summer vacation.</p>
<p class="null-p">A normal day in the life of the User of Nonsense went like this.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/zaregoto/illustrations/zaregoto_vol_06_8.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">0</p>
<p class="null-p">I won first prize in the lottery.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What will you buy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lottery tickets."</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">Phrases that come to mind regarding Aikawa Jun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Free and uncontrolled. Dissolute and unruly. Broadminded, crude yet strong. Red. Mankind's strongest contractor. Someone who accepts any job as long as the money is worth it. Desert eagle. Ogre killer. Overkilled Red. Sarcastic laugh. Always smiling, a treacherous look. The cynical, twisted speech mannerism. Slanted eyes, with the white of her eyes visible between her pupil and eyelids. Stylish suit. Loves making fun of people. Loves fun, loves trouble a lot. Overestimates other people. Pokes her head in when she senses panic and makes things worse. Hates things half-assed. Tall. Does not think about how others feel. Loves manga. Confident. Beautiful. Reliable. Someone you would never want to be an enemy of, makes you feel invincible when she is an ally, although you will need to prepare payment in kind. An aggressive way of talking, and an aggressive attitude. Forceful, unreasonable, selfish. Liar, with no trepidation over fooling others. Witty, although she does not make use of it often. Or rather, she prefers violent resolution. Mesmerizing, charismatic. Age unknown. Probably somewhere in her twenties. Loves cosplay. Drives a bright red cobra. Rides a Ducati, of course (imported), although I have never seen it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? …...what happened after that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean, after that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That…. great detective, named Niounomiya Rizumu, did you call her and told her? That you're doing something super pointless and stupid, so you look totally stupid and dumb right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…. not really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why? You should've told her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is a pain. And I do not want anything to do with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Looks really fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A little girl who is a great detective while wearing a manteau and a straitjacket and glasses?" "Looks really fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No thanks. I shall retreat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san nodded knowingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">August 4th.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was near Shijo Kawaramachi again.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was having lunch in the spaghetti restaurant above that large bookstore with Aikawa-san, or rather while sitting across from Aikawa Jun.</p>
<p class="null-p">She invited me out of the blue yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like this----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, Ii-tan. You free tomorrow? Because we're going to lunch." "Huh? Tomorrow? I need to help Ichihime-chan with her studies all of tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. Well, you're free if you cancel that, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"See you then!"</p>
<p class="null-p">-- like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">I am sorry, Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san was wearing a rather, what would you say, rough style of clothing today. Would you call it a young style, because she was wearing a tight-fitting t-shirt with her coat wrapped around her waist, slim jeans that looked like a pain to wear and take o , and instead of her usual high heels, wore sports shoes that resembled sandals except with thick soles, had a bandanna on, and tied her hair back. Everything she wore emphasized red, as usual, but it was almost like she was wearing a disguise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? This outfit? Nah, it's not a disguise or anything. I'm o today and having some private time. So I dressed up to match Ii-tan. Might as well have a day like this once in a while, it being a date and all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. this was a date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I came here filled with trepidation assuming that she was going to push another ridiculous job onto me. However, now that she mentions it, I could sort of agree with what Aikawa-san said. After all, considering</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san's normal crimson suit, no one in their right mind would think us a couple…. but rather a lady and her servant, or something like that. Well, not that we looked like a fit even with her dressing more normally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't half-bad, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Aikawa-san looks great no matter what you wear…. although I did laugh at the nurse outfit you wore once."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I said not to call me by my last name. Only enemies call me by my last name…. well, it's getting pretty annoying correcting you all the time. You're quite something to be able to beat me in patience."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a hundred repetitions, it seemed our common ritual had become perfunctory. Aikawa-san elegantly sipped up her tofu soymilk-cream pasta. Despite her rough look and mannerisms, she was astonishingly well-practiced when it came to etiquette.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had probably been trained well.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">Trained, eh?</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Ii-tan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How've you been?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. more-or-less as I just told you. I was invited to a part-time job by the assistant professor, and then picked up a great detective, and oh, the cast on my left arm finally came o . See, see," I waved my left arm around. "It is not all healed yet, but I have regained some level of freedom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Oh, your injury from last month. But if you think about it, it's quite a surprise you were able to survive that…. you did well, you did well." "…..I suppose. Even I thought I was going to die last month." I crossed my arms after hearing Aikawa-san's thoughts. "…. then again, that incident with Hime-chan the month before that, and the incident with Zerozaki before that, and Wet Crow's Feather Island before that, even though it lead to me getting to know Jun-san, I felt like I was going to die each and every time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it something to laugh about?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I feel like my life has gone in shambles since meeting Jun-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your life has always been in shambles. Even before you met me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm.</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded eerily true.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, Niounomiya , Niounomiya Rizumu, Niounomiya …. you've become acquaintances with quite the name. Your trouble-making is really gaining some shine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is wrong with Niounomiya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Wait, you don't know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. From the Tale of Genji."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Zerozaki Hitoshiki-kun didn't tell you anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We spoke about a lot, but most of it was just idle chat…. why? Is she a person from that side ? Is there something wrong with Niounomiya ?" "…. there are things in this world that you're better o not knowing,"</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san said, as she grabbed the check and stood up from her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's get out. I left the afternoon all open for Ii-tan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is quite the honor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have anywhere you'd recommend? I come to Kyoto a lot, but I've never really come here to play."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm," I also stood up from my seat, and thought while walking behind</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san. "And I am no good at playing. A working man, you might say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san paid the check.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san paid for the both of us, obviously.</p>
<p class="null-p">…..I felt a bit pathetic.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, where to go from here…. bowling or billiard or table tennis…. but there is no way for me to beat Aikawa-san in anything related to athletics. It is not like she is my caretaker, so I did not want to bore her with such an obviously one-sided setup…. but to go along with Aikawa-san's hobbies, like what, a manga cafe? There was an o beat-looking manga cafe near the entrance to Shinkyogoku, but going to a manga cafe for a date is very unromantic and shameful. At the same time, the typical, or expected, move of going to</p>
<p class="null-p">Kamogawa and just sitting together seemed wrong, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about a movie, Jun-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anything good on right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No clue. Shall we check it out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, nothing wrong with going."</p>
<p class="null-p">We walked down the stairs, past the bookstore, and then headed toward the big theater in the vicinity. That said, that theater only plays the major movies, so I do not stop by often…. ah, but, Aikawa-san likes the stereotypical stu , so maybe it will o er a menu to her liking.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, before we reached the theater, Aikawa-san said "nevermind," and stopped walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I came out to Kyoto, so why should I go watch a movie? Take me to some temple or shrine or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">What a whimsical person.</p>
<p class="null-p">The closest one from here would be Honnouji…. but there was a part of me that did not want to lead someone to a place I had not been to myself. But, being a resident of Kyoto myself, I did not know much about the sightseeing locations. When I first came here, Miiko-san guided me around some places, so I suppose I will have to choose from that set. Seimei Shrine…. Philosophy Road…. Nijo Castle…. all far.</p>
<p class="null-p">Enryakuji…. that is even further.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yasaka Shrine…. Kiyomizu Temple, that was about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yasaka Shrine and Kiyomizu Temple, which do you prefer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. Kiyomizu Temple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiyomu Temple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to jump o the Kiyomizu stage."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm kidding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of all people, you are very likely to do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">So please do not.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood, then. I must say that it is not far but it is a bit of a walk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No probs, I like walking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, where is your Cobra today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being worked on. Sadly, it broke. I guess I made it go through a lot, up to now. So, I came here by taxi today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Taxis are easy and nice, but it pisses me o not being able to drive myself." "Are you the type that cannot leave things to others? I do not understand that sentiment, myself. Well, Jun-san's job is more to make other people handle things, as opposed to delegating…. well, this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">I began walking ahead of Aikawa-san, to guide her.</p>
<p class="null-p">----that reminded me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was obviously so obvious that I had not ever thought about it, but Aikawa-san does not live in Kyoto. She seems to be jumping around a lot for work, but then, where does Aikawa-san call home?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jun-san, do you have a place of residence?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnya? Residence?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. An address where you can be reached."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope. I have a bunch of places here and there where I can hide, but I usually live in hotels. No place I can really call a home ground."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">That is quite the gorgeous life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I thought Ii-tan was like that, too. Ii-tan isn't planning on being in Kyoto forever, right? You're not living in that old apartment like you're at home , are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I suppose…. I am a rootless blade of grass. But, I do not think I will be leaving Kyoto for as long as Kunagisa is here. Unless something serious happens."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. Unless something happens, eh. I see, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san nodded in understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though I did not get what she understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">We backtracked all the way to Kawaramachi Street, and then walked south. If we made a turn at Shijou Street, we would run into Yasaka Shrine, which could be a bit of a cold shower…. so it would be better to take a left turn a bit further down. Hmm, that is a thought, to stop by Yasaka Shrine on the way back.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Niounomiya , you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san suddenly said, en route.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could call them a professional killer guild."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….professional killer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was quite a non-ordinary word.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though I suppose one could call it a common one, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, it was not a word used by this side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, a Massacre Magic Group, the Niounomiya Performing Arts Group. They're quite the name on that side of the world. Quite the name …. hahah, yep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. but it is not that rare a name is it? It could be just a coincidence," I said. "That girl, no matter how you looked at her, did not seem a professional killer at all. Well, not that she seemed like a great detective, either, but I cannot believe her to be a professional killer. I can figure that much, from her mannerism."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mannerism. …. come to think of it, the name Rizumu sounds familiar too," Aikawa-san continued. "What was it…. umm. Rizumu the Carnival …. or was it Rizumu the Man Eater ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds rather flippant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know much about them. They're a group of unidentified people, to begin with, and I go out of my way to avoid the professional killer groups as much as possible. All of those groups are filled with oddly messed up perverts. That world moves under a totally di erent set of rules -- I'd fall apart if I spent too much time with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mmm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Rizumu-chan was indeed a strange girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">A curious girl, I suppose.</p>
<p class="null-p">But nowadays, one could say that such a girl was no longer much of a rarity anymore. After all, these are the times we live in. As someone who knows Kunagisa and Hime-chan and others, Rizumu-chan did not seem abnormal enough to warrant an instruction manual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That said, a Great Detective …. the Niounomiya Performing Arts Group starting a detective agency, that's pretty funny…. but what do you think?" "Do not ask me. Although, I still think they might just happen to have the same name? It may not be at the level of Suzuki or Satou, but it is not that rare a name, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmmm. Well, that's true…. usually this sort of thing is just worrying too much. But this is you. Well, whatever the case, you should rip up and toss that business card. And change your cell phone number. You don't want trouble knocking on your door do you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…. I have begun to think I should just accept that side of things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh dear. A change in dogma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it is important for people to know when to give up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so you've accepted it. Is that because of what happened last month?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was last month…. and I am half-living with Kasugai-san right now. When you look at people like that…. you start to realize you are totally irrelevant, someone totally low level."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kasugai Kasuga. Hmph, to think that she would show up again…. an unpredictable turn of events if you want to call it that. Although she's like you in that you're both totally unpredictable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please stop…. I do not want to think of myself as the same type of character as her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…." Aikawa-san thought for a moment. "…. but Kasugai</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasuga-----she probably isn't aimless…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the beginning, she said being with me should be cause for amusement…. but I wonder. This is the same for Kou University's assistant professor, but I would like for people to not treat me like a radio station."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah. Radio station, that's a good one."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san smirked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Incidentally, does Kunagisa know? That the person who can be read</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai from either direction is here in Kyoto."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I would not tell her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cheater. Scum of man. Man of scum."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That hurts, making it sound like I am doing wrong," I said. "Kunagisa and</p>
<p class="null-p">I are long past that point. It is over between us. We are just friends now. Friends. A pure, platonic relationship in which each party respects the other but does not allow ego to get in the way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My my, a pure relationship. That sounds like nothing less than a coward's excuse." Aikawa-san gently rubbed at where it hurt. "I wonder if it's alright to be dawdling along like so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is, of course. The world only goes the way it wants to."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Only goes …. the way it wants to ," Aikawa-san repeated my words, like a cough. " As like you are alive , you'll die … researching not dying . Well, it's an old theme, that's for sure. Immortality and Everlasting Youth have been the homework of kings from ancient times. Weren't they doing something similar at the ER3, what with everything they do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows," I concealed. "I could not tell just by reading the papers the</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor gave me. It was like she was just warming up the tea…. well, not that it is surprising that she did not give me much, considering that I had yet to actually accept the invitation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what're you going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">I paused for a moment, and then answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I might as well accept, I suppose."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you'd already decided."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…. I am still hesitant, but eighty-percent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what? Curious about researching not dying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is that," I replied. "An apartment neighbor is having some financial problems. Needing 2000 this month. So, I have been in their care so much that I thought I could chip in."</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not receive a response, so I glanced at Aikawa-san, and found her to be staring at me with eyes wide open, like she had been summoned to the afterlife.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. this was quite the rare expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What what? What's going on?" Aikawa-san leaned in to me, and with practiced form, instantly put me in a headlock. "Why's that happening?</p>
<p class="null-p">What's going on for you to be trying to help someone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…. no, it is not that big of a deal," I answered, flustered. This reaction was unexpected. I did not realize I was looked upon as being so apathetic…. not that I blame her. Also, breasts. Your breasts are touching, Aikawa-san. "Returning the favor, just returning the favor. It is unpleasant to leave debts unpaid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….. mm," Aikawa-san released me from the headlock after my plain answer. "Mmm-…. uhhh, is that the one you mentioned before, the samurai-like lady? Asano Takuminokami or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, her name is not that flamboyant…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You like her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Guah.</p>
<p class="null-p">A fastball.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right down the middle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As much as Jun-san likes me."</p>
<p class="null-p">I tried swinging a light cross-counter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">No e ect!</p>
<p class="null-p">If anything, self-destruction!</p>
<p class="null-p">Self-explosion into a grave hole, no assistance needed!</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really hard to figure out…. does being unidentified and inexplicable feel that cool? Not that I care…. so, did you tell the Assistant Professor already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm, no, not yet. I need to decide on one, two, or three more monitors."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How many have you decided on, other than that samurai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I am not inviting the samurai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...hypocrite."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Call me as you wish," I shrugged. I was becoming accustomed to being the villain, so I paid it no heed. "Well, I tried inviting the apartment witch."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is one. Named Nanananami Nanami."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. You know a lot of people. So, what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'What? Why do I have to do work? My name's Nanananami Nanami, don't you know?' "</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa Jun went silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, quite.</p>
<p class="null-p">The worst witch, Nanananami Nanami.</p>
<p class="null-p">While prefacing everything by saying that I would not like to turn out like her, I feel that if I had even a tenth of her ego, my life would change quite a bit, and in that sense I cannot help but feel a sense of respect toward her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, then I tried inviting Teruko-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah! So, what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'Kyuiiii~! Teruko is happy!' Actually it did not even get that far, she declined before I even invited her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, I am stuck."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't know a lot of people."</p>
<p class="null-p">You only invited two people, she laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, of course I would be laughed at.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could try inviting classmates, but there was that thing in May, and I felt some sort of resistance to inviting truly ordinary newbies. And, I did not know if I could trust them. People that I could trust,</p>
<p class="null-p">Do they exist in this world?</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, what does it mean to trust?</p>
<p class="null-p">That you would be okay with them betraying you?</p>
<p class="null-p">That you would be okay with entrusting them with responsibility?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I know. Aikawa-san, would you like to tag along?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? I don't mind, but when was it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the 22nd of August."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh. Ah, then nope. I've got a job then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The second half of August is gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels like there's been a bunch of stu going down here and there these days. I don't know why but there's a lot of trouble going on, a boom in work big enough to make bamboo go extinct…. but something feels o ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh. Sounds rough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Come to think of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Making Mankind's Strongest Contractor work for a week for not even 1000 was pretty terrifying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I do need to call Assistant Professor Kigamine soon, given that it is almost a week beforehand…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kigamine?" She said flippantly, and Aikawa-san continued. "Kigamine?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine, you said? Just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Uh, did I say that? That is the name of the employer. Kigamine Yaku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not the part of famine (飢 餓) that is not starving (飢), but rather the tree (木) from Utsurigi (兎 吊 木) and the congratulations (賀) from Happy New Years (賀 正), with the peak (峰) of Mine Fujiko (峰 不 二 子 from Lupin III), and the approximation (約) of reducing fractions (約 分). Ah, by reducing fractions I do not mean translations (訳 文). "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kigamine…. Yaku."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you know her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, according to Mikoko-chan, she is supposedly famous. Though I do not know if that famous refers to within the school, or within some larger scope.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..no. I don't…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san narrowed her eyes and stopped, yet slowly, her eyes sharpened. She did not have kind eyes to begin with, so when Aikawa-san narrowed her sanpaku eyes, it became di cult to look at her directly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know…. I don't know, I think…. but, I feel like, I've heard that before…. no, did I see? Mmm-…. mm-?" Aikawa-san began mumbling. "Kigamine, Kigamine…. it's not that common a name, so I wouldn't forget if something happened…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Ii-tan. Don't you think it'd be better to turn that part-time down?" Aikawa-san turned to me. "I've got a weird, bad feeling about it. I can give you 2000, if that's what you need."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I cannot accept that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can introduce you to another job, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I swear to god I would rather you not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm-…. you're right. You're right, but, I guess it's better to take on this fuzzy feeling head-on instead of running…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I do not intend to head into a part-time job with such a manly outlook. "Ii-tan, you can pick anyone else for that monitor job you're trying to fill, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As long as it is someone who I can trust, apparently anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, take Ichihime."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. eh? Hime-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah," Aikawa-san nodded. "At the very least, if she's with you, the worst won't happen. She's pretty much invincible when it comes to the math of combat."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she is no match for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san did not forget to add.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, what with being titled the last apprentice of Zig Zag , that was true. The only other person to have cornered Hime-chan was the Strategist. She was more than good enough to be a bodyguard. However, was it truly alright to bring a happy-go-lucky high school girl (who was failing every class) into a serious university research study….</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ichihime's supplementary classes were until the 20th, right? Then, she's free for working part-time from the 22nd. She'll make it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed…. but I feel hesitant to eat up over half of Hime-chan's remaining ten days of free time--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who cares. She's gonna be bored, anyways. I'm the one with the bad feeling about this, so I'd usually be the one to come along, but obligations in the fleeting world are pretty strict, and it's something I can't get out of." "I see. I see…. then, I understand. I will ask her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">…..she is a nice girl and all.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I have trouble dealing with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because that girl is somewhat like Kunagisa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bright, and serious but careless, innocently direct.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, a complete opposite of myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..there's just something," Aikawa-san said, with some exasperation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm worrying for you, but you're lacking in the tension department."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Ah, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You. What's with that? Aren't you worrying over something totally di erent from what I'm warning you about? That Assistant Professor might be something seriously dangerous, you know? It was the same when I was telling you about Niounomiya earlier, you need to learn to have some tension toward life, or rather a sense of danger, you know? Have you never thought that you'd die?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said, I have long ago come to accept that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come to accept that, eh…..you sure you're not mixing that up with averting your eyes from the problem? Researching not dying is all good and all, but human beings can't actually escape from dying, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I guess that's just how you are. But it's like, do you actually have a sense of composure?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Composure?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not so much composure and more reserve strength. You're concealing your true strength at some level, right? It's not like you've given up or that you've accepted things, nothing that simple. But that you want to live life at seventy-percent power. Seventy percent…. no, more like sixty percent, about that much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I wonder. From my perspective, as the one you are talking about, I feel like I am barely hanging onto life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In all cases, your own perspective is always skewed. And that just sort of looks timid, like you're afraid of going all out…. like you're afraid of clearly looking at your upper limits, but you know, even though we're on di erent vectors, in that sense, I'm not really one to talk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because. I can't go serious."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san said, in a rare moment of self-deprecation, although she still had that cynical smirk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that sense, being the strongest is pretty boring, on paper. You can't battle when there's no opponent. Not having an enemy is a bad way to sit. That's why I always have to climb into someone's ring…...I have to play by their rules. But at the end of the day, that's still just making a mockery of them by handicapping yourself, you know? Being so much stronger and invincible is cheating. Cheating, and boring."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you know…...we mentioned him just now, but the one that was just like you, who showed up in May. Zerozaki Hitoshiki-kun. He was pretty good, relatively speaking. At the very least, he was the best, of late." "Of late…..then who was the best one, in the past? There was someone better than Zerozaki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmmm-…. there was," Aikawa-san hesitated. "However, that was before I was the strongest. There were two, when I was a kid, that I surrendered, thinking, there's no way I'll ever beat this guy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Two."</p>
<p class="null-p">That is surprising.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, that should be expected. Aikawa-san was not Mankind's</p>
<p class="null-p">Strongest Contractor from the moment she was born.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone has a past.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether necessary, or unnecessary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether favorably, or unfavorably.</p>
<p class="null-p">They arrive at the present, having stacked pasts together.</p>
<p class="null-p">They reach the future, by stacking presents together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Boring, inside…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It might just be me persuading myself to feel that way -- but that's a long time ago…. that Zerozaki-kun isn't a candidate anymore, either. That o beat great detective isn't it, and that guy isn't around anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is not around anymore -- you say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that sense, Ii-tan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Plop.</p>
<p class="null-p">She placed a hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she gripped it tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Powerfully. Without consideration or mercy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've got high hopes for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….please."</p>
<p class="null-p">I answered with a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">My voice was not all that trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop with the jokes, Jun-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you once…..right now, it's definitely a joke. So that it's nothing that you've got to worry about," Aikawa-san let go of my shoulder without much resistance. "But, I want to see it once, myself…. your seriousness. That's terrifying, and truth be told, it might be better to take you out before you ever pull out that seriousness." She did, indeed, tell me that, once.</p>
<p class="null-p">That if I were to ever find a goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">And if I were to ever work seriously toward that goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">What would happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Happen?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..that is impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because, this is how I am. Vague, and half-assed, and helpless. I do not refer to that conversation about Kasugai-san, but really, I have no goal in life, just a person wobbling about life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A clear explanation," Aikawa-san giggled, heehee. "Sounds about right. But if you ask me, not living seriously, regardless of how others feel, has to be really boring for the person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I have any reserve strength, that is the type of reserve strength that is too much for me to handle. One shall not touch overwhelming power, or something like that. Something like how human beings only use thirty-percent of their brain, and when you actually do try to use the rest, it turns out to be a pile of junk…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if it's a pile of junk, you've gotta use it when you've gotta use it. That's how reserve power works. You won't be able to stay that vague, half-assed way forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san resurrected my words.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she declared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because, you're living."</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">We made the rounds at Kiyomizu Temple and Yasaka Shrine, and then ate dinner at Aikawa Jun's preferred sake bar, and then spoke a bit afterwards, went around a bit, and then repeated taking breaks and walking around, and then once it passed midnight, in other words once it became August 5th, Aikawa-san hopped on a taxi, and we went our separate ways. It seemed, she had really only opened the afternoon, and so she was heading o to work without taking a break.</p>
<p class="null-p">She is quite swamped with work, I thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder when she sleeps.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then I wondered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was Aikawa-san working as a contractor? With her talents…. no, you cannot sum it up as simply talents, that person, Aikawa Jun as an entity could do whatever she wanted to do, and could attain anything she wanted to attain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Living yet not dying .</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she could even pull that o .</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, that is how absolute she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">That impression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet, why was she working as a contractor?</p>
<p class="null-p">A contractor is simply a proxy for someone else's work.</p>
<p class="null-p">An agent.</p>
<p class="null-p">A replacement.</p>
<p class="null-p">A substitute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was she satisfied with that?</p>
<p class="null-p">The same lady who was so insistent that other people be serious.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same lady who said she wanted to see me being serious.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same lady who said she had high hopes for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is she not being contradictory?</p>
<p class="null-p">Cannot become serious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Means the same, verbally.</p>
<p class="null-p">But they refer to a di erent spectrum, a spectrum too far o .</p>
<p class="null-p">I cannot be serious.</p>
<p class="null-p">She cannot become serious.</p>
<p class="null-p">…..that di erence is enormous.</p>
<p class="null-p">That di erence is absolute.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is the di erence between the strongest and the weakest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though one cannot necessarily call them totally separate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………... that is right."</p>
<p class="null-p">I had never thought about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I never wanted to think about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for Aikawa-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As for Aikawa-san…..what is she really after?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or perhaps, what is it she really does not want?</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe I should ask her next time.</p>
<p class="null-p">If the chance were to arise.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I remember, until the next time we meet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...well, time to go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned around. As a broke university student, I did not have the financial wherewithal to do something as bourgeois as taking a taxi. Yet at the same time, there were no buses anymore at this hour. In conclusion, I was to walk home. There was nothing to think about in particular, and it was a bit pathetic that I was doing the same thing as when I still wore the cast….</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…. sucks."</p>
<p class="null-p">After being swung around by Aikawa-san for 12 straight hours, I was exhausted. I could call Miiko-san and ask for her to pick me up…. but, I did not feel up to that, either. And, at this hour, Miiko-san might already be asleep. I did not want to wake her up.</p>
<p class="null-p">I leisurely walked along Oike Street. Come to think of it, when was it that I walked around Kyoto at night like this with Zerozaki? Where were we headed then?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a pretty long time ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot of people died then, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Enough to make me numb to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">To make me feel apathetic.</p>
<p class="null-p">To feel resigned about it, to erase it from my memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although it is all nonsense…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Telling me that I am living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Me, the one that is living like I am already dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Living…. dying…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine Yaku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Researching not dying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, that is just a metaphor, and just the Assistant Professor's way of concealing her thoughts. After all, anything related to medical studies is researching not dying, anyways. Liberal arts people like myself have a hard time distinguishing between biology and health science. However, Miyoshi Kokoromi, once my teacher, studied death. From that perspective, researching not dying was not exactly out of the blue for me, and could actually be somewhat familiar.</p>
<p class="null-p">However…. is that enough of a reason?</p>
<p class="null-p">To be poking my head into that?</p>
<p class="null-p">According to Aikawa-san, there was something that gave her an uneasy feeling, something that was uncertain, and so the right thing to do would be to back o .</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..but it is the same, either way."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was always like that. Everything should and would, at the end of the day, resulted in the same regardless of how much I regretted or repented for things.</p>
<p class="null-p">The future was the same, either way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Going to hell, or retreating to hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was my life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Following destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">Guided by cause and e ect.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the end, everything goes the way it wants to go …."</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">I ran into the stoplight at Korikawa Street, and when I stopped walking, at the end of the very long walkway, I noticed a humanoid shadow. Despite the fact that Kyoto turns into a rural prefecture once you get away from the central city, it was not that I found it odd considering that you typically do not see a dog much less a person at night. Even in a rural area, you will sometimes see one or two people taking a walk at night.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, the problem was that the figure at the other end of the walkway was not actually walking, but rather lying face down on the yellow tiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">20/20 vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it someone collapsed?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not necessarily because I had just been thinking of Zerozaki, but what crossed my mind, was what happened in May. I found myself in a similar situation then, and I lent a hand, and ended up all the worse for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not that it would necessarily happen again.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could get back to my apartment without passing through this stoplight…. 'Or are you saying that you could ignore someone collapsed on the ground and go on your merry way?'</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving Kasugai-san's words aside.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you were to ask if the guy who was just talking to Aikawa-san moments earlier could ignore a person collapsed on the ground, the answer would be no.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not wait for the stoplight to turn green, and jogged. Hardly any cars were on the street at this hour, anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you alright-?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And as I got closer to that figure.</p>
<p class="null-p">I froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……...are, yoooooou, allllll, riiiiiiight…."</p>
<p class="null-p">A dark manteau.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both arms hidden under the manteau.</p>
<p class="null-p">Long hair, glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Niounomiya Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Collapsed on the ground again…</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl, she collapsed on the ground again!</p>
<p class="null-p">I crouched close by for inspection, and she looked the same as before, just sleeping. No, not just looked the same, she was even making the "zzz nom nom" sleeping sounds, and then finishing it o by rolling over and mumbling. It reminded me of a salaryman dead drunk on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Uwah….</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like, you know.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, fate did want us to meet again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to run…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I do not want this sort of connection…. is what I wanted to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, you know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it is Kyoto, in the dead of a summer night.</p>
<p class="null-p">It being a girl and all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya.</p>
<p class="null-p">A professional killer Group.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt apologetic toward Aikawa-san, but even on a second look, she looked nothing of the sort. Leaving her thoughts about Assistant Professor Kigamine's researching not dying aside ----I did not feel this one warranted that sort of caution.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am used to dealing with weirdos.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could not be any worse than Tamamo-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. but it is not like I can carry her on my back."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san had picked up Rizumu-chan on the first of August, and today is the third. She had said at the time, I hadn't eaten in three days , so perhaps she collapsed under the same circumstances. Then again, did she not say she had a habit of losing consciousness? If that is true, then the first place I should take her is the hospital. But that comes with the same problem as taking her to the police…. those being a Great Detective and the straitjacket .</p>
<p class="null-p">In any case, I could start with slapping her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as I reached out to her face with that thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fwip.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a coiled spring, Rizumu-chan's body snapped up, and as if to avoid my hand, jumped away three meters in less than an instant. That was incomparable even to the agility she showed in lunging for the sushi the other day.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the eyes looking here were wide open.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wide enough that I thought maybe even the pupils were open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan stared at me with oppressive silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then I realized.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it was because I tried to slap her cheek?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that was, just…. wanting to--"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment I tried to make an excuse, no, by the time I started, as if she had rocketpacks on her legs, she had already closed the three meter gap. That, too, made her body tackle the other day look like child's play. Her momentum was so great that her manteau ripped o and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">And revealed her straitjacket.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she, with both arms sealed by the belts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Had her mouth wide open, aimed at my throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. eek."</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought I was going to be eaten.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san's words flew through my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Carnival . Man Eater .</p>
<p class="null-p">Cannibal.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Ts, u, uwaah !</p>
<p class="null-p">Even before I could call it dodging, propelled almost by pure primal fear, I tumbled to avoid the attack. Or more accurately, I was not able to dodge her incisors, and the tip grazed my right cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">A sharp pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">And a cold feeling, like I had been nicked by a blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not so much that it was painful, so much that it burned.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not so much that it was hot, so much that it chilled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahahah! Gyahahahahahahahahah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looked like she was laughing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey... wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was already kneeling on the ground. I would not be able to dodge another attack from this posture. Even though it did nothing to separate our distance, I stretched my arms out in front of me, and showed my palms to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She turned to look at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Blood trickled from her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">My blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was red.</p>
<p class="null-p">Red, red.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Coldly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ri, Ri…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I finally managed to blurt out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rizumu-chan…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"---- oh."</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">At last -- she spoke in human tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the one that helped Rizumu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood up…. and stepped back from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She saw that, and disgustedly, laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew, almost made me eat you by accident…. close one, close one. Gimme a break. We're only allowed to massacre for one hour a day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. w, what, do you mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahahah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She roared with laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably, for no reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was taken aback by her every action.</p>
<p class="null-p">The way she talked…. was totally di erent. Not just her speech mannerism, but her ambiance, the emotions in her eyes, her everything. Who, is this? It was as though, as though the only thing that was the same was the vessel -- but that the inside had been flipped over completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">A hallucination.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it really?</p>
<p class="null-p">Who, is this ?</p>
<p class="null-p">Her appearance -- no.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it her ?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like a di erent person.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it looked like the same exact vessel.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like a di erent person.</p>
<p class="null-p">That smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. Ri, Rizumu-chan…. right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm What? Rizumu? Rizumu-chan! Gyahah! Phew, nice nice what a fun and pleasant and poetic and wonderful mistake! Noooo you're gonna make Rizumu-chan so hot and shivering and paralyzed deep deep down in the bodyyyyyyyy…. yeah!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, roaring laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if unstoppable, loud laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahahahahahahahah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was….</p>
<p class="null-p">No.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was coming closer to me, one step at a time.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if playing with his prey, as if threatening his prey.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if having fun, as if being happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not now …." and then he introduced himself. "I'm Nishizono Shinji…. not!</p>
<p class="null-p">Gyahahahah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a professional killer contracted by order! With fourteen holy crosses at my side, I begin executing my errand!" he said, as if he were roaring at heaven. "Right now, it's time for Niounomiya Izumu…. Izumu the Man</p>
<p class="null-p">Eater ."</p>
<p class="null-p">3</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time I returned to the apartment, all the lights had been turned o , and my room was a husk, with Kasugai-san nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">That person was like a phantom.</p>
<p class="null-p">In her place was one letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was elated that I was finally rid of the person who paid nothing for the food she was eating, but then I read, 'I will be going with you to Assistant Professor Kigamine Yaku's part-time job so best regards I cannot rob you yet but I'll eventually learn (Just kidding. Aren't I cute?) Kasugai-chan @ silver and gold and balls are at any rate peerless PS. Regarding The North Wind and the Sun, don't you think you would never actually wear a coat to hide your skin from the sun?' so that woman had read the contents of the envelope, even though I had hidden it. Well, she had seen me come back with it that day, and given her former job, I figured she would eventually find it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyways, that settled the people to bring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai Kasuga, Yukariki Ichihime, and then myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a multi-colored party.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at my watch, and it could still be counted as midnight. But I felt these things should be communicated as soon as possible, so I pulled out my cell phone. University faculty hardly ever adhere to day and night cycles, anyways. And she had told me she was fine with being called at night. I figured Hime-chan would be alright with being told after the fact, so I pulled Assistant Professor Kigamine's business card from my wallet, and dialed the number on the card.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I got the answering machine.</p>

<p class="null-p">August 14, Sunday.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, I cut my hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood in front of a mirror, then turned around, and then faced the mirror again, and tilted my head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan…. do you not think this is too short? I am not an athlete or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no, this is how it is. This is how Hime-chan imagined it turning out." Hime-chan crisply spun the hair-cutting scissors that we bought from the dollar store around her finger, and proudly stuck out her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan always thought Master's hair was too ragged and bothersome and annoying and irritating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that what you were secretly thinking…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the moment we met."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And it was your first impression…."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was simply too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Master, I already cut your hair, so you'd just be complaining after the fat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the fact…. after the fact…. given the situation she must mean after the fact.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. oh, well."</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood up from the newspaper sprawled out on the ground with my cut hair all over, and took o the towel wrapped around my neck. And then I put my shirt, which I had taken o to limit the mess, back on. And then I turned back to the mirror and stirred up my hair again. Yes, well, it was not bad. At the very least, it was certainly no longer bothersome.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Hime-chan. I like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shling shling shling , Hime-chan coolly spun the scissors vertically and into her pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mufufu, Master definitely looks better with shorter hair."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To show my gratitude, I will cut Hime-chan's hair next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nuh-uh, please no. And Master, your gratitude was supposed to be helping Hime-chan's summer break homework and the extra homework. They're due tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is right. But Hime-chan, your hair has gotten pretty long, too. You have not gotten them cut for two months, since June, right? That is no good.</p>
<p class="null-p">Girls need to at least get them trimmed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that sexism?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not really. I just thought it was getting long."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not getting long, Hime-chan is making it get long. While su ering how with how it is. Hime-chan wants an image-change for the upcoming winter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They say your hair grows longer if you do erotic things. I would gladly help if you so desire."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How crude…."</p>
<p class="null-p">She gave me a frosted look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan is rather into chastity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Master. Why'd you suddenly want a haircut? Like, an eyedrop from the second story window."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">This one was hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">So I gave up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm. See, look at this scar on my face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes," Hime-chan did as she was told. "Hmm. Umm, was it ten days ago, that after you went on a date with Jun-san, that you said you got bit by a dog."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. This looks almost like a tattoo, does it not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, until it heals all the way, kinda."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, if I kept my hair long, my identity would overlap with a certain character. I was filled with self-loathing every time I looked at the mirror these last ten days, so that is why I decided to cut away."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan tilted her head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, of course she would not get it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had met Zerozaki before I met Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Master, is that scar really gonna heal? Shouldn't you go to a hospital?" "Well, it should heal cleanly because it is shallow. Although for some reason it is healing really slowly -- but it should be gone by next month. And even if it did not heal all the way, these sorts of scars are a medal of honor for men."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say so. I think that's only for cool guys."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Are you trying to say something, Hime-chan?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyways. I need to head out, now." I grabbed the bag I had prepared beforehand, and said to Hime-chan. "You can stay in this room if you want. Apparently Kasugai-san will not be coming back today. See you, make sure to close the doors when you leave."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…. um, Master. What about helping Hime-chan with summer homework and extra homework, in exchange for cutting your hair?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan has a ways to go to believe me so easily. You will su er in life if you do not become more careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're unbeatable when you stop caring! Hime-chan wasted an hour in a precious vacation day! The supplementary classes resume tomorrow!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lions drop their children into a bottomless ravine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just population control!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey now, Hime-chan. You should be careful with how you talk to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite how I look, they call me rabies at university."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I cannot swim."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bungler!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I left Hime-chan behind in my room as she warbled on in a tearful tone. Walked down the hallway and down the stairs. And then, into the outside world from the apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Koutoumaru-san was doing his noon exercise in the courtyard. Apparently some dumbbell exercise that was all the rage a long time ago. But apparently the quirk compared to the old fad was that he was using a dumbbell weighing 20kg on either side. He was deftly handling the giant dumbbell like he was just partaking in morning radio exercises while showing of his naked, tanned upper body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Summer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Blue sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Muscled old man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I decided not to greet him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such good weather today.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such good weather that I could only look at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stepped out onto Chuudachiuri Street, and then headed toward the parking lot. At the parking lot, Miiko-san had lifted the bonnet of her Fiat, and was working on the engine. Even for an Italian car, the Fiat 500 required a lot of maintenance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san looked cool again today, wearing a sporty, black tank-top and a jinbei up to her waist, with the top tied around her hips. Because of the bright sun, or because she did not want it to get dirtied by the oil.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inoji, heading out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heading out. To my friend's house."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A friend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The blue one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, unii."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked to the Vespa parked next to the Fiat, and then put on my helmet and goggles. My arm was not fully rehabilitated, but I need it to be by the time the part-time job starts on the 22nd. Rehab, rehab.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hair."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You cut it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't suit you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Guah.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. what a downer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. ah, sorry, I messed that up. Let me try again," Miiko-san shook her head. "It suits you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not think it was at all possible to mistake it doesn't suit you and it suits you , but am I allowed to believe that she did not simply say her first thoughts at first glance?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks cool. Manly. Girl-killer. Beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You do not need to force yourself…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was beginning to feel as sandy as a desert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You got it cut quite a bit. Hou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that'll crush Hou. She's always wanted to cut your hair."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I do not want Houko with a blade standing behind me…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miiko-san, what are your plans today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Job-hunting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I may not make it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do not be so depressed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. You're right, the lottery ticket I bought the other day might be a winner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be so optimistic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You ask for di cult things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I am sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, I still kept my job a secret. Hime-chan and Kasugai-san are also keeping quiet. Leaving embarrassment or possibly surprising her aside, I felt like the first thing that would happen would be a lecture, if she were to ever find out. That was why, to try to obfuscate things, I was buying her dinner, or buying her livingware, or paying for her electricity bills, and piling enough dirt to build a mountain of financial help. …. although it makes me feel faint thinking about how long it would take. And if that does not turn out to be fast enough, then at worst case, I can just make her borrow money from me. Not that I would have any desire to be paid back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">I need to repay Miiko-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">She helped me quite a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is still helping me.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before I leave the apartment -- before I never return to this apartment, I want to make sure I pay her back for everything she has done for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. not that I have any plans to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no. Anyways, I shall head o , now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miiko-san, I love you-."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love you-."</p>
<p class="null-p">And, onward with the Vespa.</p>
<p class="null-p">My destination was Shirosaki, the most high-class residential area in Kyoto. It was a leisurely, speed-limit abiding ride on a Sunday in Kyoto, with cars and street lights everywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday, finally, I had my call returned by Kigamine, exactly ten days after I left a message. Well, I suppose from the perspective of university faculty, that is just how it goes. I had not followed up myself, anyways. Leaving Kasugai-san aside, because she has the credentials, I expected to hear something about Hime-chan and her age, but that did not happen, and I was told the three of us would be fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">'However'</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, she wanted to interview us and run us through a sort of test, myself included, to measure our fit. I figured that to be expected, given the nature of the study. She asked for a preferred date, but because Hime-chan has supplementary lessons filling every day other than Sunday up to the 20th, she could only go today, or the 21st right before we would be heading out. But as it happened, Kigamine turned out to be busy today. But we surely could not leave things until the day before, so it seemed we would not be able to take the test during the day. It seemed Kigamine was quite busy, so I told her that we could go with whatever suited her best, and so she said let us go with that. As such, we would be taking the test tomorrow evening. 'I apologize for it being so hurried, but that is the only day I am free.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'No, I do not mind. I have nothing to do tomorrow evening, anyways.' 'I had already predicted beforehand that you would be free tomorrow evening.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'……..'</p>
<p class="null-p">…. really.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are you a prophet?</p>
<p class="null-p">'Well…. then, let us go with that.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Thank you very much. Until tomorrow evening.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Tomorrow, in other words, the evening of the 15th.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, leaving aside the possibility of testing on the day before, I could not imagine there being alternate subjects this late, so the test itself is probably truly something of a ritual. More an opportunity to meet face-to-face and have a chat, and so unless something serious happens, everyone should be alright.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. Hime-chan…. and Kasugai-san….</p>
<p class="null-p">Something serious could happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fit was a word that could hardly be used to describe the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. ow."</p>
<p class="null-p">The cut on my cheek hurt from the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scabs may have torn o .</p>
<p class="null-p">When scabs tear o , blood flows.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I'm alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I'm apparently alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">For now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is all nonsense…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I arrived at Shirosaki in about an hour.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa Tomo was absent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. a shock."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I arrived at the thirty-floor, super luxurious mansion, I dialed her cell phone, but she had headed out today. You told me no such thing, I thought for a moment, but I had likewise not said a word about coming to see her, so this sort of happening happens, happenstance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, if you were to think about it normally, I understand that I should have made an appointment beforehand, but who would think that the little girl who always no matter what takes not a single step out of her house would somehow be out of her house the moment I decide to show up? Ahh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Too bad, because I wanted to show her my new haircut.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is quite boring.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh well…."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had gone to the hospital, so that was that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today happened to be the day of her monthly exam.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I were to want to follow through, I could go to the hospital (the members-only Kyoto Branch of the Kunagisa Syndicate Comprehensive Hospital) with my Vespa, but Nao-san would be there if their schedules aligned. I did not consider myself barbaric enough to intrude on some sibling time.</p>
<p class="null-p">And I did not particularly need her or anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Showing her my hair, well, could be done any time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though I could not dispute being at a loss.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hopped back on the Vespa that I had stopped by the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm, yes, I was beginning to feel a bit bad, so maybe I could go help Hime-chan with her homework, as I had promised…. I said one should not learn the easy ways out, but no matter the perspective one takes, that amount could not be finished by one person. The faculty at the school probably never expected someone to be taking supplementary classes for every class.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">I realized that I was being watched.</p>
<p class="null-p">Staring at me with their back against the brick walls of the mansion. A pure white, almost funeral-like Japanese outfit. I could not say it was uncommon in the Kyoto summer, but they fit perfectly within the long-sleeved garment, and it gave me a very cool and refreshing feel.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was also wearing a fox mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask remained silent and noticing that I had noticed him, nodded lightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">I, for whatever it was worth, nodded back.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. what is that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is the vintage model of the Vespa that rare a sight? Or perhaps he thinks the</p>
<p class="null-p">Vespa seems out of place in such a high-class residential area?</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, I hesitated, in moving the Vespa forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">And as I did so, without a word.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask stopped leaning against the brick wall, and without a word, walked toward me. Slowly. Slowly. Without a sound on his zori, he walked. I could not move.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. yo."</p>
<p class="null-p">When we were two meters apart, the man with the fox mask spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A pleasure to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that we were closer, I could tell that he was very tall. At least 190 centimeters. That made him seem a bit non-Japanese, but the traditional clothing fit his slender form very well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. a pleasure to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">I returned the greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could not see his face because of the mask…. but the voice, and the rather lordly feeling he gave, made me assume him older.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. 'A pleasure to meet you', " the man with the fox mask repeated my words. "You're alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, um, yes. I am alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'I am alone'. Hmm. So that would mean you had business with someone in this stupidly large mansion."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just about."</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'Just about'. And, then you missed each other."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it is -- well, to be honest, the same happened to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also 'missed each other'. What a coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was hard to explain, but he had a very in-your-face, a very aggressive way of speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course in my case I'm simply waiting in vain , and have nothing to do with this mansion -- this building, it stands out like the Kyoto tower. Rare for Kyoto…. but I like it, this sort of destructive architecture. The utter lack of care for everything, the jagged foreign shape. I've wanted to meet the politicians and architects that modeled Shirosaki…. but anyways, I was thinking this would be a pretty good touring point and landmark, and it looks like the person I was waiting for will never get here because they got lost. People who get lost in Kyoto and Sapporo are helpless idiots, in my opinion anyways."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh. But this part is no longer like a Go board."</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'No longer like a Go board'. Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask seemed to laugh at that. Although I could not tell for sure, given that his face was covered by the mask. It is pretty di cult talking to someone you do not know when you cannot see their expression. "By the way, brother. How about we go somewhere and have a chat, as fellow left-behind blockheads?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we're both left behind, you don't have any plans now. I find myself with some time now as well, so it isn't a proposition to kill each other's time. I can even treat you something nice, if you'd like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh-…. um, well, no thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">I found myself a little speechless. I was a bit stunned by his strangely decisive word choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My mother told me not to follow people I do not know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. You're running."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why do I have to be told that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Though, I am running!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I am running," I accepted it. "After all, if I step back for a moment, you look way too suspicious. What is that mask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A fox."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was given an explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A fox is a mammalia carnivora canidae vulpes vulpes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You knew."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. I did not know."</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not know foxes were dogs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprising.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. Oh well. I called out to you because I felt some sort of connection with you, but given your reaction, it is probably nothing significant enough." "Connection?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Connection.</p>
<p class="null-p">Destiny. Karma.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Words that I feel like I am hearing a lot more lately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, you…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-! It's Onii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The question I was beginning to ask was cut in half by the energetic voice that suddenly sprung from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned around, and there was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow! What an encounter, surprising! What a coincidence, to be meeting again in a place like this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. yo."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was still wearing that manteau.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girly smile went well with the glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both arms were in the manteau.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pitter-patter, she ran toward me like a little animal with hair flailing wildly behind, and it almost made me have a sense of fondness for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there is surely not one human being that would complain about how this gives me a sense of wariness instead. I stepped o the Vespa that had been left o . It is di cult to make necessary reactions while seated on a</p>
<p class="null-p">Vespa without its engine running.</p>
<p class="null-p">Necessary reactions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's been a while, Onii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Boom! she started to tackle.</p>
<p class="null-p">I dodged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hikyaunnn!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan slid along the asphalt while making an extremely bizarre, grinding sound. It seemed she could not brace herself with the lack of arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A- are you ok!? Hang on, Rizumu-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for play-acting worry with such a loud voice!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was not damaged in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she stood up using only her leg strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm good!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is splendid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're late by three hours, Rizumu."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask said in utterance. Rizumu-chan jumped with a gasp, and turned back to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you wouldn't be coming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"M- my oh my! Mister Fox! You were here before me! As expected of you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Three hours ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected of Mister Fox!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be admiring."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for your e orts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be thanking me for hard work," the man with the fox mask chopped Rizumu-chan's head. "And if you're going to say that, it's I appreciate it. Be careful with your words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! Mister Fox, I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're fooling no one."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask chopped Rizumu-chan again.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then he turned to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. this is who I was waiting for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who I was waiting for -- but it seems, from that reaction, brother. You seem to know this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, though while I know…."</p>
<p class="null-p">While I know.</p>
<p class="null-p">While I know, I would like very much not to know.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Half a month ago, he took care of me when I collapsed!" Rizumu-chan introduced me without hesitation while I wavered. "And then he even lent me money! My appreciation would be thank you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh. Well isn't that something…." the man with the fox mask took stock of me from head to foot. "Eccentric."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. eccentric."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sort of careless politeness will lead to no good. If you do that, this fool will forever think someone's going to help her. Or are you going to say that you're always going to be around to help?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh. Uh, um…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Giving feed once, but then not giving feed the second time is insincerity. It's ego, the pride and joy of humanity. It's also not good to give despairing people hope. People who've been given hope and start a revolution usually end at the guillotine. The ones that live in the end are the agitators that gave hope…. however," the man with the fox mask said. "I'll return the money she borrowed. You did this idiot a favor, I give you my thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I would appreciate being given thanks first.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was starting to repent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ummm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">But you know. That was originally pick-pocketed by Kasugai-san. But it is far too late to say that now.</p>
<p class="null-p">How troublesome.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Three hundred. Right, Onii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm-…. I think it was less…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Three hundred. Here."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask took out his wallet, and then gave me four</p>
<p class="null-p">Fukuzawa Yukichi.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. four?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Interest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…. thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">The guilt….</p>
<p class="null-p">The guilt keeps growing….</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onii-san is a good guy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wish everyone in the world were like Onii-san! Then things would be wonderful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love people like Onii-san! I wish I could take you home for myself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guah…. uguh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">That smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a 'This world is wonderful!' type of smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">The holy energy started corrupting me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it on purpose? Is she doing this on purpose?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is she trying to kill me with guilt?</p>
<p class="null-p">Then that would truly be an unsolvable murder.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl -- is she going after a perfect crime!?</p>
<p class="null-p">I tolerated the pain in my heart, and shifted the topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. um, if I may, how are you two related?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love-… mgh!"</p>
The man with the fox
<p class="null-p">mask's long arm reached out and covered Rizumu-chan's mouth so tightly that there was not even a millimeter of open space. Rizumu-chan, without arms, had no recourse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know it's my profession."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm…. detective."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mgh…. mgh…. great detective…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan tried, anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she was being held at bay with one arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mgh Great Detective, it seems," the man with the fox mask said without emotion. "And, if I'm to go with that, then you could say that I'm its assistant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Assistant?"</p>
<p class="null-p">An assistant to a great detective.</p>
<p class="null-p">That would be Watson. Or perhaps Hastings. Or perhaps, umm,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kobayashi-shounen. Not that I know much. However, is this person not too strong a character to be an assistant?</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that is not good enough, then you could call me a patron…. or perhaps a client. Hmm. Though words are pointless anyways. Even if I explain it with words, it'd just be futile."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. futile."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nonsense."</p>
<p class="null-p">A grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like the fox mask laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I---was speechless. There was no reason to be speechless but I was speechless. It felt like, it felt like I was being forced into silence for a terribly unreasonable reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I were to try again.</p>
<p class="null-p">I got goosebumps.</p>
<p class="null-p">I got such goosebumps that I almost did not get goosebumps.</p>
<p class="null-p">mask continued, "If you know each other, then I must</p>
<p class="null-p">really insist," he said while nodding satisfyingly at my speechlessness. "Come along. It looks like you and I really did have some connection. Trying to go against this level of destiny is reckless. Destiny is to be parried , this is basic. Carving out your own destiny is arrogance to the cubic square---we're not being swept along by destiny, we're allowing ourselves to be swept along by destiny . Hmm. This is why I can't stop living…. Rizumu, stop standing around like that. Invite this person, properly." "Ah, okay!" Rizumu-chan was finally freed, and turned to me and straightened up. "Well then, Onii-san, come this way!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There're only bricks that way," the man with the fox mask's unrelenting chop struck her skull again. "I parked my car over there…. let's go. You, just leave your Vespa parked there. They won't enforce parking laws in a place like this…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, yes…. um…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I took o my helmet and hung it from the handle of the Vespa. Ahh, I guess I end up being swept along like this again…. even though I know this indecisive personality causes problems.</p>
<p class="null-p">I feel like this happened before….</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. ah, ahhhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Rizumu-chan shrieked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Onii-san, your hair fell out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No it didn't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this girl saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words are taboo to an adult boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I cut it…. as a change of pace."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh. I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks good does it not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She paled.</p>
<p class="null-p">….whatever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop dawdling. Hurry up."</p>
<p class="null-p">mask said as he walked ahead. I had not actually given</p>
<p class="null-p">him an answer, but this person seems quite forceful.</p>
<p class="null-p">Destiny is for you to create.</p>
<p class="null-p">This, Assistant Professor Kigamine had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet in most cases, destiny is a constantly churning gear that keeps spinning like a wheel regardless of your actions. Allowing ourselves to be swept along.</p>
<p class="null-p">This----was also, rather exquisite.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around the corner was a parked white Porsche. It had been a while since I had seen this Porsche model in person…. wait, this car is a two-seater. I could stu myself in the back, but that is….</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, just put Rizumu on your lap."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this person demanding from someone he has just met?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to let other people touch the steering wheel… so if you don't want to, hey Rizumu, you can walk…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no, I do not mind, really."</p>
<p class="null-p">I hurriedly said, and then I stepped into the Porsche. What is with this person…. if Rizumu-chan is strange, then this person seems rather delusional? But then again that is not how he seems…. for the most part he seems very logical, but it is di cult to get a feel for what he thinks. Though</p>
<p class="null-p">I will say that a Porsche and a fox mask is quite the fashion statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eheheh, a human chair!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan said as she sat her butt on my thighs.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. do not call other people a human chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">A human chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not an ounce of sexiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. she means no ill-will.</p>
<p class="null-p">I shut the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. so, where to, kidnapper?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leaving Shirosaki out east, and then after a bit of a drive, there's a good store. Mountain soba, and the ingredients are all natural produce. It's a store that gives us tangible proof that no matter how much people tinker and try, we can't beat nature."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh. Sounds nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made a reservation for two, but one more shouldn't be a problem." "Perhaps. But it is natural produce, right? Then maybe they only have enough for two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you and Rizumu will split."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not splitting."</p>
<p class="null-p">He proclaimed boldly.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought he was treating me….</p>
<p class="null-p">Not that it matters, or rather as someone sitting in the passenger seat it does matter because it a ects my life, but is he able to see in front of him and the streetlights and other cars with that mask?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahah-. Mister Fox has quite the appetite! Being gluttonous. Wonderful!</p>
<p class="null-p">Mister Fox, I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're being over-familiar, Rizumu. How many times do I need to tell you to watch your words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. I'm sorry," Rizumu-chan looked sad for just a moment. And then the next moment, she turned to me and smiled. "I got yelled at!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. it seems so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yelled at once and smarter once!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan wriggled around on my lap. I dared not say it aloud because it was about a girl, but she was pretty heavy. Probably because of the manteau. Probably about 40 kilograms total….? I looked down a bit and at</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan's hair whorl. Her silky black hair looked all the more pretty this close.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, it reminded me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of that day, that night.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the great detective transformed into a professional killer. "Ah, come to think of it, Onii-san, I heard you met my brother Izumu, is that true?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for why, because that was the truth. If I am asked whether the truth is the truth, then I must nod. Anyone would do the same. I would do the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I am feeling good, anyways. Sometimes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met Niounomiya Izumu. That was an undeniable truth. However, this was also not the second time I met Rizumu-chan, but rather the third. "What's wrong, Onii-san? You went all quiet. Ah, did Izumu do something mean to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like that. Your brother, if I may say so, has quite the personality. Has he always been like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. Since a long time ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You two are... similar."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh? Not at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rizumu-chan, you know…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you treasure your tongue, I recommend shutting up."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask butt in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're speeding up."</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">After a long-enough drive that I thought we would be leaving Kyoto, I was brought to what you would call a traditional Japanese restaurant. An old-fashioned exterior that seemed exactly what you would expect in Kyoto. And it also matched the man with the fox mask's traditional attire -- though not so much myself in casual clothing, and Rizumu-chan in her manteau.</p>
<p class="null-p">The room we were led to was almost three times as large as my apartment room, and the scrolls and flowers were so splendid that I was sure Miiko-san would go crazy if she were to see them. …. though I had never seen Miiko-san go crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kyoto Kaiseki was brought to us.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan and I had oolong tea, being underaged, while the man with the fox mask had Japanese sake in a rock glass, and we toasted. No one said anything about a toast, but we nevertheless clinked our glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">I dampened my lips just a bit on the oolong tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugii ugii ugii."</p>
<p class="null-p">As for who was making the sound of an American bullfrog, Rizumu-chan of course. Unable to use her arms, she had clenched the tea glass with her teeth and raised a toast anyways. She almost certainly had enough jaw strength to bite through a mouth gag.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought that to myself, as I caressed the cut on my cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had not merely allowed myself to be carried along by this obviously suspicious-looking man with the fox mask, and the great detective side of this two-personality girl wearing a manteau and glasses. I had reason enough, and as for that reason, there were actually two.</p>
<p class="null-p">First, and this was personally more important -- the man with the fox mask. How this man intends to eat while wearing the fox mask. Or perhaps, how he intends to drink liquid. It was not the type of mask with an open mouth area, so it would surely be impossible to eat and drink while wearing the mask. I was curious.</p>
<p class="null-p">…….. and.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. what? Stop sitting there and eat."</p>
<p class="null-p">He immediately took o his mask and reached out to the meals with his chopsticks. And then he brought the sake to his mouth with a refined motion. He certainly looked the part of an experienced man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it was obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, no one would su er if everyone could do the obvious when it was obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've been looking like you want to say something, with that puzzled face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. you take o your mask."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm. Yeah," the man with the fox mask glanced at the mask placed to the side. "I don't know how else to eat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then why are you wearing a mask! I had to restrain myself from asking. That was something that should not be asked, just like Rizumu-chan's manteau. I wanted to avoid delving further.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man behind the mask had quite the manliness to him, like aged masculinity. His angry expression was a little…. no, I should say it bothered me some, but anyways it helped give him a handsome look. The kimono worked to give him a sort of kabuki actor impression. I did not think he had a need to hide a face like that behind a mask, but perhaps that was part of the man with the fox mask's personal fashion statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, it cannot be helped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's say one of my reasons has been solved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the second reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh, um, Rizumu-chan--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up," the man with the fox mask checked me with an eerily quiet, yet powerful voice. "Don't talk while eating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ehhhh-….</p>
<p class="null-p">Doesn't that make eating together…. pointless?</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at Rizumu-chan. She was eating like a dog again, but she was quietly stretching her tongue out to the meals. Quietly, munching.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">When in Rome, do as the Romans do.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't let us meddle with our betters.</p>
<p class="null-p">Follow blindly. Opportunism.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not that it all mattered.</p>
<p class="null-p">I acquiesced, and quietly reached out to the meal with my chopsticks.</p>
<p class="null-p">The taste was rather thin, and it was not particularly good.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I am just a pleb, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm? Did you say something, brother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, thank you for the meal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having finished his meal, the man with the fox mask put his mask back on.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the post-meal tea was brought to us, he finally turned to me and o ered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, let's talk. You were about to say something." He remembered. "Ah, umm…. Rizumu-chan. That mental labor you mentioned before…. were you hired by this person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" mental labor ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She forgot.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed it was not a finishing line or anything, but rather something she came up with on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, that you were looking for Zerozaki something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Zerozaki Hitoshiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. you know of Zerozaki Hitoshiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? No no, I do not," I hurriedly and flatly denied. "There is no way I would know. Why would I know of someone like that? What proof do you have that I know of an abject human failure like Zerozaki Hitoshiki? That is quite insulting. Really, truly terrible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looks like they are being suspicious!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"N- no, really, I just thought it was a bit of a strange name. Zerozaki, you know, Zerozaki. And then Hitoshiki. It seems so stupid. Laughable really, it is not every day you run into a masterpiece of a name like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….. hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">I could not tell what expression the man with the fox mask was making, because of his mask, but it did not seem too di cult to discern the suspicious gaze from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I am the one that hired her," the man with the fox mask finally said. He said, and at the same time, he chopped Rizumu-chan's head. "And you shouldn't be blabbering to everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh please, Mister Fox. I wasn't blabbering. I whispered. Whispered."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">She got chopped again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan did not have any means of shielding herself. And furthermore, her head happened to be at just the right level for it to be very easy for the tall man with the fox mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. well, no problem. There's nothing wrong with you having heard about it…. not like there's anything to hide. Rizumu. How did the investigation go? I came all the way to Kyoto and even prepared this location today to hear your answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Umm, yes," Rizumu-chan seemed to straight-up a bit. "In conclusion, the person named Zerozaki Hitoshiki is no longer in Kyoto."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or rather, it seems he was killed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask seemed to hesitate before nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is, a shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected, or should I say, as the Mister Fox had said, the serial murders that happened here in Kyoto in May…. the suspect behind those murders was without a doubt this Zerozaki person. I was able to find proof. And it seemed he was killed right after."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will present you with a detailed report later, but most likely, I was not able to procure the result that Mister Fox sought. My condolences."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wow.</p>
<p class="null-p">The police had not issued an o cial statement of any sort when it came to the May serial murders. I thought it was belated for Rizumu-chan to be investigating Kyoto now, but it seemed it was simply that she began investigations late (she probably began around the end of last month), and it seemed her label as a great detective was not a case of pumping up inferior goods with a better name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pumping up inferior goods with a better name.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, perhaps even that was being too harsh.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, the man with the fox mask was looking at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh huh…. and that Zerozaki person, was he a friend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'Was he a friend'. Hmm, I don't know him at all…. at all. Never even met him. But, from what I'd heard, he seemed like someone with quite the amusing destiny , so I wanted to get in touch with him…. but if he's dead, there's nothing to be done. There's no way to deal with someone whose destiny has shut its doors. It seems Zerozaki Hitoshiki and I's destiny were not meant to be intertwined."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask looked obviously disappointed at</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan's report. He was so glum that you could tell even through his mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Onii-san. Do you know of the Zerozaki Family?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I do not."</p>
<p class="null-p">I answered carefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask looked at me. "Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Zerozaki Family. They're…. a group of serial murderers that can't even become evil . An ugly army of which it is taboo to make an enemy of. The worst gathering of which it is taboo to make an ally of. A treasury of wicked blasphemy. They're merely third in name…. but they're by far the most reviled among the killing names ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask's words sounded like a foreign language to me. It felt like the information only flowed into my head in bits and pieces. And he did not seem to actually be explaining to me, anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Zerozaki Hitoshiki was a natural-born child to them. Natural-born, and I mean natural-born to the point of having a birth certificate. He was… a child born from an incestuous relationship within the Zerozaki . The one inexplicable and impossible exception among a group that doesn't think about keeping things together for the future. An exception, truly an exceptional outlier. You could call him the most serial murderer of serial murderers, the most Zerozaki of the Zerozaki…. I really wanted to meet him while he was alive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki Hitoshiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">I reminisced.</p>
<p class="null-p">The many, pointless conversations we had.</p>
<p class="null-p">He laughed a lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">He talked a lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">And within him….</p>
<p class="null-p">I saw a bit of myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though I had to restrain vomiting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask said, as if to provide a conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In any case, this topic ends here…. now, brother. My work here is done…. and I'm left with free time. So, let's talk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh huh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">So he said.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I also felt like I fulfilled my goals. At the very least, the two reasons for me coming here had been resolved….</p>
<p class="null-p">If there is anything else that I would want to ask.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be whether the man with the fox mask knows about</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan's brother --- Niounomiya Izumu…. and that would be about it. However, that topic is rather di cult to ask….</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, we are not exactly in front of him….</p>
<p class="null-p">What a pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, then!" Rizumu-chan energetically raised her hand. "Me me me me! I have a question that I would very much like to ask Onii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to ask you since the last time we met!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is your relationship with that kind-looking Onee-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">A childish interest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, I just asked the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master and maid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hawah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan arched backwards in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M- maid! Onii-san, was a maid!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th- then that Onee-san!? That pretty and beautiful Onee-san, was a maid!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes yes. She was. She takes care of everything around me. Kasugai-san calls me master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it was Ikki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not in front of other people, anyways."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Hmm hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">She accepted it.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl was fun to trick.</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'Kind-looking Onee-san', " the man with the fox mask said. "So what. You were in the care of someone other than this Onii-san, too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. you shouldn't be bothering people so much. It starts getting troublesome. This Onii-san is alright, but stop creating connections with pointless people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes sir."</p>
<p class="null-p">"However…. once you create a connection, I guess you can't call it pointless regardless of what destiny it is. Because this Onii-san and that Onee-san 's connection had already been formulated , you formed that connection with the both of them. In most cases, there's nothing you can do about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….connection?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, connection."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask seemingly chopped Rizumu-chan's head for no reason, and then turned to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you believe in fated meetings?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">I feel like I heard them from someone, at some point, at some place. "For example…. right here right now, three people are gathered --- some people might call this a meaningless coincidence, but there's a perspective that that's not true ." "….connection."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You helped Rizumu two weeks ago, and then two weeks later the fortuity to by coincidence meet myself, the client of that Rizumu…. that's no longer fortune or coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. are you saying that is destiny?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's nothing in this world that's meaningless. Everything has some significant meaning to the world -- for as long as you're a piece of this worldly construct, you can't escape from the curse of fate. Didn't I tell you earlier? We're allowing ourselves to be swept along by fate. If there's anyone that thinks they have no value, that they're living without any relation with the world…. they're past the point of ignorance and into the realm of arrogance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. are you a fatalist?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More of a story-ist, I would say. I don't think there's some idiot like a god, but there's definitely a Story to this world. That's why the characters appearing in that Story, the cast of that Story…. have no freedom. They have freedom, but that's why they don't have freedom. Just, just just, following the Story."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Following…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The three of us met there because we were meant to meet there. That'd be the cliche way to say it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, if Kunagisa's monthly examination was not today.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, if Rizumu-chan had not gotten lost en route to Shirosaki. For example, if the man with the fox mask had chosen another place to meet.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it was not necessary for there to be such a big change.</p>
<p class="null-p">There just needed to be a slight shift.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I had not spoken to Miiko-san at the parking lot, if I had fulfilled my promise to Hime-chan, or any other such whimsical thing. That was all it would have taken for me not to have met this man with the fox mask, and to reunite with Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">The result of such intricate coincidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it right…. to say that we met because we were meant to meet?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, there's some level of limited freedom…. like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask toppled over a tea cup.</p>
<p class="null-p">The spilled inside spread over the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slowly, gradually.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. this, unreasonable, pointless, unnatural action can be done. But we can't resist the bigger picture, the Story. We have small freedoms, but not large freedoms. The gigantic freedom is destroyed by smaller freedoms. Like a caged bird. Whatever you do, it gets corrected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Corrected…."</p>
<p class="null-p">A caged bird.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if the cast of characters go and act on their own.</p>
<p class="null-p">The story itself cannot be changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, corrected. Well, it's too late now so this is just stupid 'what if' theorizing, but if we were to miss each other today, at that place. In that case, you would of course not meet myself nor Rizumu…. or so you would think, but that's not how it works ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megante--…." Rizumu-chan dropped her forehead on the table. "Mister</p>
<p class="null-p">Fox, I don't know what you're saying. By the way, if you split it in half,</p>
<p class="null-p">Megante sounds like a girl's name."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As for what happens then."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an oppressive and impressive display of ignoring.</p>
<p class="null-p">" You and Rizumu and I would meet at a di erent place, and we would have a similar conversation . The timeline would shift a bit, but somewhere sometime , at a di erent location and di erent hour, we would still partake in this action. I call this phenomenon Back Nozzle…. incidentally, there's no guarantee that Rizumu and I would be together in such a case. You might even meet us one by one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alternatively, as another possibility, instead of meeting Rizumu and I here…. there was a chance that you would have met another person. Someone with whom you would have had a conversation that provided the same meaning and result . This wouldn't need to be another human being of my level, or lower or higher, nor would it need to be someone who necessarily must appear again in the story, as long as it's someone who gives you the same meaning as myself. Well, given this level of destiny, probably anyone would do as a substitute. Even when it comes to</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu…."</p>
<p class="null-p">He glances at Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. even if it were this one's big brother Izumu, your fate probably wouldn't have changed much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Izumu…." I could not help myself from interjecting. "……..-kun, you say." "Ahh…. ahh, come to think of it, you did mention in the car that you also met Izumu. Then that's all the more true, If you didn't run into Rizumu here and now, you probably would have met Izumu somewhere and sometime .</p>
<p class="null-p">That's how it goes. I call this phenomenon Jail Alternative.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back Nozzle and Jail Alternative.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if you procrastinate on something that must be done now, you still end up having to do it at some point, and if it still must be done now, then someone will end up doing it in your stead.</p>
<p class="null-p">The system of the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">That…. is almost like.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is almost like, the world has a will of its own. Not at the level that most people think about when referring to gods and the creator of the world but…. as if the story itself has a means of ensuring that everything returns to the way it should be ….</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, how about those that struggle against fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are they erased by fate itself?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just to tie loose ends.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natural selection.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natural selection, with the invisible hand of god.</p>
<p class="null-p">That phrase fitting, if you only take the meaning of the words themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fitting, fate-wise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fitting, destiny-wise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't that strange a story, nor that revolutionary a story. 'Molecules formulate into predetermined shapes of atoms' -- 'same atoms all have the same shape' -- 'atoms cannot combine in more ways than have been set' -- 'connections are secured under pre-established rules'…. and then 'the power to return to the way things were is something all things fundamentally have'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All things…. then, fate, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'All things…. then, fate, too'. I guess you could call it fate's automatic recovery system. Or an error correction system. No matter what you do, it'll be fixed somewhere else in the end . The balance sheet is closed. Loose ends are tied. It means that the world isn't seeking some absolute revolution. No matter how di erent the yin, all the way at the end, you will still arrive at the same yang----a pre-established harmony…. ahh, that's right, I guess the easy way to put it would be that thing. Space Will."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, you haven't read Ghost Sweeper Mikami? What were you doing up to that age without reading manga?" the man with the fox mask said with a bored tone. "I can only call it inferior, but how about the Dragonball?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. do you like manga?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask declared, bluntly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're not familiar with these words, how about the Akashic records? There's a bit of a disjoint if you think of it that way, but it should help you understand. In other words, fundamentally, it's the work of fools to fight against fate. And to carve your own path? Impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. that sort -- I had not heard such a decisive opinion on the matter before, …. but I must say, it does not seem like a bad opinion."</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not have to fudge any thoughts to give that opinion, and from my past experience, there were plenty of parts with which I could agree. I definitely could not agree with the notion that there is nothing meaningless in the world, but even that was not something I could not understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fate is decided .</p>
<p class="null-p">Decided means there is no room for change.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is not a religious concept…. but rather one that mathematical, statistical, and probabilistic concepts could also say. At the end of the day, human beings only have a select few choices at any given moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that is the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that is the case, it is ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that is the case, it is a masterpiece.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, this me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Would have ended up being me no matter what happened ----</p>
<p class="null-p">…. that is.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is, nonsense----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who the Earth revolves around? That's been set in stone forever… the Earth revolves around the Earth. Those that think the world exists for them and those that think they're useless to the world both are making the same fundamental mistake…. both helpless fools."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. if I were to pick, I consider myself someone that provides no value to the world," though that would be the case regardless of the choices. "Then of course you would be the exact opposite, in accepting yourself as a member in the cast of characters, a piece of the world bound by the prison of fate?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know about that…. I'm a guy that wants to stand outside of that story. A story this amusing…. is much more fun observing from the outside than being a participant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. can you even do that? If your theories are correct, then it would be rather di cult to step out of this story, out of this world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Di cult…. but, not impossible. No, you could say I'm already standing outside--</p>
<p class="null-p">I've already been exiled from karma.</p>
<p class="null-p">---the best I can do to participate is to meet with people like brother. I'm half-assed and vague."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Zzzz, zzzzz, snort."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan had fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems our conversation was boring.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, this must be one of the most boring conversations to be listening in on. It had gone so far into the conceptual, that even for myself, participating in the conversation, the words of the man with the fox mask seemed as hazy and illusory as a dream. You could say I do not actually understand what he is saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, then why.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then why does what this person says strike so deep?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why does it resonate?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why does this nonsense resonate?</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed, right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost like I was being told an outrageous confession--</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, no.</p>
<p class="null-p">I do not want any part of such importance.</p>
<p class="null-p">I do not want anything to do with the core of the story.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's why I have that great detective or something over here working in my stead and working and such…. look at me well, brother. Take a good look at how I am. This is the result of a man who fought against fate. Aren't I pathetic and downtrodden? Though I admit I like this pathetic-ness and downtrodden-ness, myself…. losing isn't so bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. did you fight against the story, in the past? Is that…. what you mean by being exiled from karma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pretty much. Because of a slight mishap, I was about to utterly destroy the law of cause and e ect, that law that shouldn't really be possible to destroy. The punishment for killing a god has always been exile from paradise. …. hmm. In retrospect, that wasn't very thought-out, and I'm still dragging it with me -- but I don't consider that the follies of youth, because if I didn't do it then, I'd be doing it now…. Back Nozzle and all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Utterly destroy the law of cause and e ect…."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that would be.</p>
<p class="null-p">An apple will fall , rain will fall , the sun is bright , the night is dark , you laugh when you are having fun , you cry when you are sad -- you die if you are living .</p>
<p class="null-p">A rebellion against karma.</p>
<p class="null-p">A revolution against the existent destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">A declaration of independence that sets up camp against the oncoming absolute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Researching not dying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I suppose Assistant Professor Kigamine's research is also something along those lines…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….'Assistant Professor Kigamine's research is also', " the man with the fox mask caught and repeated my words. "…. is that what you said, brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Umm, yes. I did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kigamine…. Kigamine Yaku."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Ah, you know of her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must really be famous, then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san seemed to know of her, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. what a nostalgic name . Come to think of it …. that was part of the cast of characters back then, too ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Brother. That Kigamine….. umm…. Assistant Professor. Hmm. Tell me about Assistant Professor Kigamine's research ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he is asking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Am I actually allowed to tell him?</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Human Biology Department of Kouto University and, umm, something about researching not dying…." " 'Researching not dying' ."</p>
<p class="null-p">He repeated like an incantation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, the man with the fox mask stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Given his height, when he looked down at me as I sat on the cushion, it felt like I was being looked down upon from heaven.</p>
<p class="null-p">My body suddenly felt cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">My heartbeat raced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, uh. Yes…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. Kigamine…. is, doing something like, that…. no, maybe…. perhaps, that was left behind…. didn't calculate…. no, I just forgot."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask began muttering to himself, barely out of my hearing. He looked completely di erent from before. He was quite eccentric already, but now, it was like, you would say…. not so much an eccentric but rather.</p>
<p class="null-p">A madman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amusing."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask said with a tone that reeked of abject boredom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore, he looked both displeased and disturbed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You and me's connection …. it seems to be a very amusing one indeed. How fascinating. I thought Zerozaki Hitoshiki was my main goal…. but maybe you were the right answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. This average-looking ordinary boy that I just so happened to encounter in a no particular place …. that, too, is quite amusing. Well, it is cruel for both you and I to desire that much. There's no way, would be the way to put it. I don't think that's possible, but it's correct."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, umm…. mister, fox?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wake up, Rizumu."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask kicked Rizumu-chan's ribs with his toes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyan!" Rizumu-chan yelped while waking up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh- what? Ah, you finished talking!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're going home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? B- but, it's still early! I still want to talk to Onii-san! We finally met again!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have business for you…. and your brother…. and we're on the clock. We're too short on time. Even if it's a case of Back Nozzle, this should be done as soon as possible -- hurry up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….. mmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan looked to be in disagreement, but she did not argue further.</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably, or rather almost certainly, brother was a keyword for the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Put on my manteau please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right."</p>
<p class="null-p">The sight of the rather haughty man with the fox mask helping</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan with her manteau was somewhat funny.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes-. Well then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan, now wearing her manteau again, turned to me while sitting, and then saluted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well well well! Onii-san, until another time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">I answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give Izumu-kun my greetings, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kay! Farewell!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan's smile was blinding.</p>
<p class="null-p">But her incisors were peeking out from her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sharp incisors.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, uh, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Feel free to take your time. I'll finish paying the bill…. I'm sorry after inviting you, but as you can see, I can't send you back anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask placed two 10,000 yen bills on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To pay for a taxi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that is right.</p>
<p class="null-p">I need to go back to Shirosaki to pick up my Vespa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. thank you for everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'For everything'. Don't worry about it. Well then--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- if we have a connection, let us meet again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan and the man with the fox mask left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">I remained alone, after the shoji was shut.</p>
<p class="null-p">Three tea cups remained on the table. One was toppled over, with its content spilled out over about half of the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that had nothing to do with the story.</p>
<p class="null-p">And fate did not bother stopping it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything happens as they do.</p>
<p class="null-p">And only as they must.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without recourse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything, that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. ahh."</p>
<p class="null-p">And that was when I finally came to the realization.</p>
<p class="null-p">I got it, I got it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why I had come here.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was not the trivial questions like how he would eat while wearing a mask, or because I wanted to ask about Zerozaki. It was a more simple, easy matter.</p>
<p class="null-p">That unreasonable personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">That forceful way of talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">That lack of inhibition for hitting people.</p>
<p class="null-p">That lack of care for other people's situations.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, that manly face beneath the mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">And more than anything else, that triumphant, confident look--</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person was very similar to Aikawa-san…."</p>
<p class="null-p">3</p>
<p class="null-p">Midnight.</p>
<p class="null-p">I headed straight to Hime-chan's room on the first floor after returning to the tatami apartment. Hime-chan sat brawling with the mountain of homework piled on the small glass table that looked totally out-of-place in a tatami-floored room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why does she study?</p>
<p class="null-p">Because there is a mountain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….yo, Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She shot me an incredibly resentful look.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could not help from taking a step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be given such a look when I was feeling charitable about helping with homework and such…. well, actually it is quite deserved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. my bad," I apologized, and then I sat at the table to face her. "It is great that you were able to do this much alone. Yes, yes, you did your best,</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan. Good for you, and have a pat. I will do the rest for you, so</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan, go ahead and take a break."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. what do you want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it that you wish of me, princess?" I tried acting like an inexplicable character instead of just being polite. "Please, go ahead and scrub the floor with this user of nonsense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. no, I'm fine," Hime-chan heaved a non-forgiving sigh. "All is last when given to a fool if you take Master seriously."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am glad you say that."</p>
<p class="null-p">I would have been happier if she had said all is lost when given to a fool, but</p>
<p class="null-p">I also do not have such high expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In exchange, please butcher me sometime."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I would be open to treating her sometime….</p>
<p class="null-p">She messed that up, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Master, where did you go today, anyways?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows…. I was taken by car, so I do not know for sure, but some traditional restaurant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A traditional restaurant!" Hime-chan expressed surprise. "A traditional restaurant, as in a traditional restaurant? The ones that a lot of important people go to for scheming…. Master! What scheming eviling have you been up to!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such prejudice…." Also, evil cannot be used that way. "Oh, that reminds me, Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">I decided to ask while doing her homework (for 7th graders, and because it was for supplementary lessons, the questions were even easier than you would expect). Yes, Aikawa-san is very sloppy, so it was expected for her to only know rough details, but perhaps Hime-chan would know more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan, do you know of a kid named Niounomiya Rizumu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….. Niounomiya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could be Izumu, too. Niounomiya Izumu, or Niounomiya Rizumu, either of them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….." Hime-chan went silent for a moment. "Niounomiya, Yamiguchi,</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki, Susukino, Hakamori, Tenbuki, Ishinagi…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she say something?</p>
<p class="null-p">I could not hear her well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamiguchi? Ishinagi?</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan and Moeta-kun?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I know them. The Niounomiya siblings, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, so they are famous," I paused my writing hand. "Aikawa-san seemed to know them, too, but for some reason she was not very helpful. You know, because of how she is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, they're not famous. It's the opposite if anything, Hime-chan just happens to know of them. The Niounomiya Siblings of Massacre Magic, Izumu the Man Eater and Rizumu the Carnival …. of course, Hime-chan has never met them, but I've heard about the Massacre Magic of the Nounimiya</p>
<p class="null-p">Circus Troupe from Hagihara-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hagihara…. Shiogi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Strategist and Sumiyuri Academy student representative, Hagihara</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiogi.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not so long ago that I could call it a nostalgic name, nor was she someone who I could easily forget, and to be honest, there was nothing about that girl that was worth being nostalgic over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hagihara-san fought Niounomiya once when she was a first-grader. I just heard her talk about that. Otherwise, you'd never know about what's going on in Niounomiya …. because they don't leak any information. It's pretty rare to find an organization so good at being secretive, both in the underworld and otherwise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like, Fragment , the five-man Niounomiya group. They're a nutty killer with five bodies housing the same single soul. They're a pain, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">You hafta try to block ten arms with just two."</p>
<p class="null-p">One soul in five bodies….</p>
<p class="null-p">What…. is that?</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, I thought of the Chiga sisters at Wet Crow's Feather Island.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chiga Akari, Chiga Hikari, Chiga Teruko…. no, I think that was a joke by</p>
<p class="null-p">Teruko-san, or maybe it was not….</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. you can manufacture that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beats me. But I don't think Hagihara-san would lie like that…. Niounomiya are a troupe that do whatever it takes to make methods of murder look like magic. Common sense and bias are both totally pointless with them. That's why they're given the name the Niounomiya Circus Troupe of Massacre</p>
<p class="null-p">Magic. They're all like seasonal articles…. even their branches."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seasonal articles…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sounded like something Hagihara-chan would say.</p>
<p class="null-p">The straight-forward strategist that took advantage of every available fastball and curveball.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I didn't find this out from Hagihara-san, but I've heard there's a three-person group in the Circus that uses a Japanese katana, a naginata, and a bow…. philosophically to come after you from close range, mid-range, and long-range, but like, that's a pretty seasonal, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seasonal."</p>
<p class="null-p">Which means places like Sumiyuri Academy, not counting Zig Zag , and</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki Hitoshiki are in some ways pretty orthodox.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, being seasonal and all aside -- they're definitely the most powerful group of killers. Jun-san, even that battle-loving Mankind's Strongest</p>
<p class="null-p">Contractor Aikawa Jun, prefers to avoid confrontation with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That much…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. And that Man Eater Izumu and Carnival Rizumu…. I'd heard of them from Hagihara-san, just like with Fragment ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. then, you know of them . Or rather, of her condition."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Double personality?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Double personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also known as Dissociative Personality Disorder. There is no need to explain it, for it is commonly used in manga and novels and movies. Kunagisa Tomo would probably think of Billy Milligan the 24 people , and Aikawa Jun would probably think of Sensui Shinobu. Though it does not matter what you think of.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I'm the sub if anything, and Rizumu is the main. Gyahahah! Guess you could say I'm the body and she's the humanoid!'</p>
<p class="null-p">He -- Izumu-kun had explained.</p>
<p class="null-p">'So does Rizumu-chan know of your existence?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Of course she does. Though she doesn't seem to know I'm inside her. That's how they set her memories. Yeeeeees! We talk on the phone sometimes, you know? Sort of like, hello? It's me, Doppio.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'……..'</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm.</p>
<p class="null-p">I posed another question to Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I still do not understand. What is the benefit of having two minds in a single body? The advantages of having five bodies for one mind makes perfect sense…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm. The sister's personality, Carnival , has no killing powers. And I mean like, none whatsoever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Rizumu.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The brother Niounomiya Izumu, Man Eater takes care of all of the massacre work."</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Izumu.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is all the more confusing…. they call themselves a Massacre Magic</p>
<p class="null-p">Troupe, but one of them lacks any killing skills…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm. It's hard to explain…. Master probably won't really get it,"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan crossed her arms. "Even Master should understand why Hanging High School trained young girls as berserkers . And, so, sending in a little girl with no skills for killing to the target. Do you get what that means?" "…. a spy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More than that. Because she is unconscious about it. She non-conscientiously gathers information useful for Man Eater , and then creates a situation perfect for Man Eater . Consciously and subconsciously, she investigates and creates the perfect stage for herself. That's the role of Carnival ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, like, as a secondary e ect, she probably acts as an emotional stabilizer. Man Eater Niounomiya Izumu -- sounds like he's bonkers…. or like, his personality is pretty broken."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Like a radiator."</p>
<p class="null-p">So more Sharaku Hosuke than Sensui Shinobu.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, when I was ruining a seat over at the ER3 System, I dabbled in psychology a little, but I never actually met someone with Dissociative Personality Disorder. I never imagined that I would run into one -- like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I wonder if that was also manufactured."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows…. like I said, there's no way to dig deeper. Death awaits if you go any deeper. Hagihara-san also didn't…. well, maybe she didn't tell Hime-chan for safety concerns," Hime-chan said. "By the way," she looked at me. "What about the Niounomiya siblings, Master?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I feel like I should avoid telling her that, actually, Kasugai-san picked up the little sister last month, and then I met the big brother personality, and then</p>
<p class="null-p">I met the little sister personality again today.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no need to add to her worries.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan is di erent from Aikawa-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing, was just wondering. …. by the way, how did Hagihara-chan fare when she fought the Nionoumiya Circus Troupe? Did she win? Or did she lose?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hagihara-san doesn't think of things in wins and losses . Her matches are counted di erently. To her, victory and defeat are simply a move toward the next move."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. from that perspective, Hime-chan and Aikawa-san were probably not enemies to Hagihara-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Hagihara-san was like someone endless playing Go against herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why she was tough to approach…. other than Saijou-chan anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Hagihara-san seemed to be more annoyed by her than anything." Hime-chan suddenly looked lonely. She tried to look down to hide it, but I caught a glimpse. Nothing could be done about catching a glimpse. I could not act like I saw nothing. Please, stop. It hurts me to see such a look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, jeez.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl makes me want to do something for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan, come here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come here like I asked, here, around the table."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan did as I asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Raise your arms."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan did as I asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Close your eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan did as I asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, she must learn to be suspicious of people.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I sexually harassed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yaahhh!" she screamed loudly enough to shake the entire apartment as she backstepped away from me in a manner that could only be described as agile. "Wha. Wha- wha- what are you doing! W- where are you touching!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beats me, where did I touch?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. ugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey hey, that sucks, Hime-chan was touched in a place that can hardly be described? What a perverted girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh~, uh, ooooough…. egh, ugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I may have gone a little too far.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was not how it was supposed to be. All I wanted was to break the mood because Hime-chan was suddenly going into a somber nostalgic mood. It is a misunderstanding. Please do not give me that look, I am not a pedophile nor underage sex o ender.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uguh…. ugh, Master, why, are you, always so mean, to only</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan…."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was seriously crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tears everywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. umm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am sorry. Please forgive me."</p>
<p class="null-p">I gave a direct apology.</p>
<p class="null-p">With no nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. waaahhh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, because it looked like Hime-chan was being nostalgic. …. it is not something you want to remember much, right? Hanging High School -- about Sumiyuri Academy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. But, it's not like, there was nothing good from there. Like</p>
<p class="null-p">Hagihara-san and Saijou-chan -- and."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">And, probably.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sheisei Yuma as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahah, and you know," Hime-chan wiped her eyes, and forced herself to smile. "It's not like school's much fun now either. All this studying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Students are supposed to be studying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. well, it's like. Master is paying for Hime-chan's tuition, anyways."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. that is true."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san was technically Hime-chan's guardian, and Aikawa-san was transferring funds into my bank account for her living expenses, but I was the one paying for tuition.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the incident in June, I had a conversation with Aikawa-san that went like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ahh? Who cares about school.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'It is no good this way. How is Hime-chan going to find a job with that personality? If she has no skills, then she should at least go to university.' 'Blah. Look at this guy all stained in social customs. Fine then, you're paying for tuition.' 'Of course!'</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the last line was a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then my savings ran dry. I am slowly recuperating some of that by working as a tutor, but I cannot dispute the notion that I put my foot in my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">And you know, I think I suck at using money.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you hate school?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you do not like studying that much, you can quit. I forced you to go, anyways."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. No, that's not what I mean," Hime-chan waved her hands around in denial. "I hate studying, but it's fun being with friends and such."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well that is good to hear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. and you know," Hime-chan returned to her original seat at the table. "At the end of the day, Hime-chan enjoys living right now. Everyone in the apartment is friendly." Hime-chan stared at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">With such innocent eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was not just innocence.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were a lot of things, a lot of things that she had to overcome.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that innocence was a result of it all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like my lifestyle now. Life is fun. That's why I really appreciate everything, Master. Hime-chan is now, really really happy. Life is filled with happiness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That…. is good to hear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why…. I'll forgive you for most things," her innocent expression transformed. "But if you do that again I'll tell Jun-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you're telling me to die…."</p>
<p class="null-p">What a terrifying girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is she really appreciative of me….?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that reminds me, Hime-chan," I decided to put energy into changing the subject. "After hearing about Aikawa-san…. have you heard of her having a brother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A brother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. as in a family member?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. I saw someone that felt a lot like Aikawa-san today…. he was wearing an animal mask, and he was actually the person I was doing some evil scheming with at the restaurant."</p>
<p class="null-p">I excluded mentioning Rizumu-chan and explained the conversations that I had with the man with the fox mask. Hime-chan tilted her head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. doesn't sound similar."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jun-san would never say something like 'destiny is set'. If anything she'd say the opposite."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Carve out your own destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">If anything, Aikawa-san's position, is indeed probably more on the side that the man with the fox mask laughed upon as being foolish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jun-san would snort at such stupidity like the world being a story. She'd say something like 'the story is for you to write for yourself'." "That is true…. but the nuance was a bit di erent. Umm, how would I explain it…."</p>
<p class="null-p">The world has a story.</p>
<p class="null-p">And each and every person has a meaning. And there is no meaningless cast member.</p>
<p class="null-p">However….</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if the meaning is not fulfilled.</p>
<p class="null-p">The balance is closed somewhere, at the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is a reason for everything in the world, but that is all.</p>
<p class="null-p">No meaning to success.</p>
<p class="null-p">No meaning to failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">The yin may di er, but the yang is the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… isn't that worse than just talking about destiny normally?" Hime-chan asked. "…. because…. because that doesn't mean 'there's a meaning to life'…. or that 'there's no meaning to life'…. ' but that there's a meaning but regardless of whether you fulfill that meaning, the result is the same' --is what he's saying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well --true."</p>
<p class="null-p">That is true.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no need to adhere to destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no reason to resist destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way,</p>
<p class="null-p">If that is the same--</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone will eventually take care of your failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then allow ourselves to be swept along by destiny --is.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is quite a lot to be asking for.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should be a lot to be asking for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've never heard of Jun-san having a big brother…. or like, Hime-chan's never heard of Jun-san talking about any relatives."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, Jun-san obviously would have parents…. and could have siblings, but you know despite how she looks, she never talks about the past."</p>
<p class="null-p">Never talks about the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">Never talks about her own past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's similar to Master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although I would think the reason for that di ers completely between myself and Aikawa-san… but I see. Then he is probably not a brother…. relative…. might also be impossible…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, a similar stranger.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is how things go.</p>
<p class="null-p">Simple, but probable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm…. but he was rather suspicious… suspicious, or more like, asking to be suspected…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Does that masked guy bother you that much?" Hime-chan leaned toward me. "Then, should Hime-chan go kill him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was such a…. such a nonchalant, nondescript way of posing such a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My fingers are fully healed, and I fixed the weakness Jun-san taught me, so as long as that masked guy isn't that crazy, he should be easy…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I yelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">That seemed to startle her, because her eyes widened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh- what? Why're you shouting so loud?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. Hime-chan. That -- that, is not good. That is…. that is not needed. For</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan to live on this side now, those words can never be said again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…. but."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No buts."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I am in no place to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I still must say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You must never again say that you will kill someone. Killing someone is even worse. Otherwise…. you will lose everything in the life you are enjoying now. Are you not having fun? Are you not enjoying life now? If you are enjoying it, then you must enjoy it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Got it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. got it," Hime-chan said with a sad look. "I'm sorry. I'll reflect on it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">If you can apologize there, you are fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is not too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not too late, like it is for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not too late, like it is for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is too late for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">…. that is also, nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">I self-deprecated.</p>
<p class="null-p">What do I think I am doing? Really, what do I think I am doing. Do I think there is any power behind my words, as someone who did not make it? Who am I to say something like that? There is no point in me saying something, because it is too late for me--</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though nothing changes in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Carve out my own destiny?</p>
<p class="null-p">Laughable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Laughable?</p>
<p class="null-p">Make me laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is that not your job?</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I am a clown.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan looked downtrodden, and also looked as though she was expecting more. Really…. really, I am poor at dealing with this girl. Truly poor. Why am I having to bother with someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Responsibility.</p>
<p class="null-p">Obligation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was I a good enough person to act for something like that, to work for something like that? When did I suddenly become such a good person?</p>
<p class="null-p">I had no idea, really.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or, maybe I am just acting like I became a good person.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe I am trying to have Hime-chan do what I was not able to do, in my place, before it is too late for her too.</p>
<p class="null-p">My alternative.</p>
<p class="null-p">A contracting of my crime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah, that is exactly right.</p>
<p class="null-p">I do not want to do anything anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am, in truth, not good with Hime-chan not because she is similar to Kunagisa. In truth -- because of that, I project myself on her. In a di erent way from Zerozaki -- Hime-chan is very similar to myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is why, Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least you should live properly, Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is what I want.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Be on your best manners during the suitability test tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! Leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan smiled and answered joyfully.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/zaregoto/illustrations/zaregoto_vol_06_10.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">0</p>
<p class="null-p">I agree with your opinion.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I would rather die than acknowledge your right to that opinion.</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">I saw this reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">One in which there was myself, sitting alone facing the serial killer that brought fear and confusion to Kyoto during May, though the memory of that incident has become nothing more than a flickering haze to most. Where, and when, just blandly and quietly, obsessively and quietly, quickly and quietly, while taking care to keep our sounds mu ed from the darkness surrounding us, we talked. The serial killer asked me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Have you ever killed someone?</p>
<p class="null-p">I answered the serial killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please, of course I have never killed someone. Killing someone is preposterous. I have never ever killed someone and I do not ever plan to kill someone. I have held myself in check even when I had the urge, and I will continue to hold myself in check no matter how many emo tions sweep over me in the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">The serial killer forced a laugh at my answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Liar.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am not lying. I would not lie. I do not lie. Do not act as though I am the same as you, because we are di erent. Human beings that kill people are mentally broken. They are abnormal.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a ridiculous masterpiece. In this world. In this day and age. In this world and in this day and age with so much misfortune and violence and deceit and bloodshed and horror -- there's no one that's killed no one.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought to myself that I probably actually agreed, but agreeing would not allow the conversation to continue, so I played the devil's advocate and scolded the serial killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is a skewed opinion. What you say is so o -target that it is actually embarrassing to even listen to. This world is not filled with only misfortune and violence and deceit and bloodshed and horror, there are other things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Plenty of other things. You could say the other things are the majority.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, fortune.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, justice.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, love.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, friendship.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a masterpiece.</p>
<p class="null-p">The serial killer narrowed his cat-like eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Splendid, splendid. A masterpiece, no doubt about it, a masterpiece. The foolishness is so satisfactory, that it hurts my stomach to listen to. Such things don't exist, such places don't exist, such times don't exist, they're just all fakes that look like mirages. They're all so phony it makes me puke. Fortune's just decorated misfortune and justice is another word for violence and love is a byproduct of deceit and friendship is just a reflection of bloodshed and dreams are the prologue to horror. Fate and destiny and karma and inevitability are all just destructive fairy tales for massacring hope. There's not a penny of value in just living in this world. There's no point in living. They say if something can go wrong, it will, and that's just how life is, full of despair. Worms and spiders and pond skaters all die too, rotting corpses all of them. What comes of living? Murder is everything. Having to kill. If there's someone in front of you, kill them, and if they're behind you, kill them. If they're not near you, find them and kill them. Kill and be killed and eat each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">I cannot imagine that you are saying that seriously. You will probably say something di erent tomorrow. Murder is for living. Murder is meaningless. Murder is art. Murder is space itself. As if you are colored like a rainbow, you will find another meaning in the same action. Because you are like the manifestation of whim. The same way I also am like the manifestation of whim. However, you have nothing acting as a restraint, including these words of mine, and as such, you are much too free.</p>
<p class="null-p">And you, because of all that, are much too un-free. You're right, of course it's all a joke. As much of a joke as your existence. Good grief, you're miraculously un-free.</p>
<p class="null-p">The serial killer joked.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I don't think you're being serious, either. You're a big liar, and you say anything but the truth. Because you don't look in the least like you're fond of humans. Not that you dislike them either. You hate them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not at all. There are plenty of humans I like. Movies filmed by humans, music composed by humans, art drawn by humans, cooking perfected by humans, cars and planes engineered by humans, academics studied by humans, stories penned by humans, they are all fantastic things.</p>
<p class="null-p">You just like movies and music and art and cooking and cars and planes and academics and stories. That you like movies and music and art and cooking and cars and planes and academics and stories indicates how little you think of humans. How you just think of humans as a petty machination to create culture and arts. That perspective is broken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Broken?</p>
<p class="null-p">Defective.</p>
<p class="null-p">I think that is saying too much. You act like I am mad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then do you like humans?</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">I like humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">The serial killer said with a grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">I solemnly asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then why do you kill humans?</p>
<p class="null-p">The serial killer solemnly answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who knows? I don't care, and I don't care to know. It doesn't matter to me one bit who and how many I kill. It's all someone else's business. Murder has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then why do you say you like humans?</p>
<p class="null-p">The serial killer answered with the same manner of speech.</p>
<p class="null-p">I like humans. I like humans. I love humans. I need to keep saying that. Regardless of the truth, regardless of what the truth is, I need to keep saying that. Because if I don't, I'll probably start to dislike humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dislike, humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I don't, I'll probably hate humans. That, I'd rather avoid. If I don't put in the e ort to like humans -- if someone I actually like shows up, I'll probably kill them.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">You don't think I can change.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't you want to change?</p>
<p class="null-p">And with those words, I fell asleep, and returned to my dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then--</p>
<p class="null-p">And then August 15th, on a Monday, as well as the World War II Memorial</p>
<p class="null-p">Day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Four o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p class="null-p">We were getting ready to leave on the Fiat 500 I was renting from Miiko-san after Hime-chan had returned from her battlefield (school).</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan, you don't need to change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oyo. How come?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Students tend to do better in interviews while wearing their school uniform."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is the same in the sex industry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up, Kasugai."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said without honorifics, as the three of us gathered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Myself, Kasugai Kasuga, and Yukariki Ichihime.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I must say that I absolutely don't want to be sitting in the tiny backseat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You and your princess-like demands again…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's ok, Hime-chan is small."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll take the passenger seat."</p>
<p class="null-p">After everyone got in, I made sure the doors were shut, and fastened my seatbelt. Turned the key, and o we went.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our destination -- Assistant Professor Kigamine's personal laboratory. A few hours from the antique apartment…. is what I had been told, but you could never know for sure until after the first trip. Well, even if the trip were to take five hours, things would surely not be boring with this group.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. are you reminiscing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san said, suddenly and without warning. Well, not that this was anything new for this person. Suddenly and without any context was neutral for her, the usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Last month. Sort of deja vu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. heading to a laboratory in a Fiat…. I suppose it is a similar premise," I carefully chose my words. "But that sort of happening is impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine is not undertaking preposterous research like</p>
<p class="null-p">Professor Kyouichirou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Researching not dying, was it? You could fold preposterous three times over. Though you could also say that it's rather hysterical."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this time we are just working part-time, and we are not going there to help someone. And the group we are going with…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Last time, I went with Kunagisa Tomo and Suzunashi Neon. I glanced at the passenger seat, and at the rear seat through the back mirror. And slowly nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai Kasuga is on our side.</p>
<p class="null-p">That spoke for itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We should be alright with this group."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, this personal laboratory is not supposed to be as stupidly large as that one, anyways. Something like, it was converted from a clinic that an old acquaintance had been running…. so it is like a slightly bigger single-door house. I would call it less of a laboratory and more of a lab room? Though I do not understand how you people decide on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san shrugged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, that's true. Even if they are similar it's like comparing a Fiat five-hundred to a Subaru three-sixty…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is completely di erent!" I could not help but shout. "And stop calling it a Fiat five-hundred! Are you making fun of me, are you declaring war on me, Kasugai-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">She apologized.</p>
<p class="null-p">I got too heated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. and you know, if you want to go there, it is like the di erence between the north pole and the south pole…."</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, on the surface they seem like similar things, and if you look at them from afar with subjectivity, there are no significant di erences between the two, but as someone acquainted with both, they are completely and fundamentally di erent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master," Hime-chan's voice came from the rear seat. "Hime-chan is in a tired mode, so may I sleep?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Ahh, yes. Sleep, sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks-."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I know you are tired from school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no-. Hime-chan was just thinking of working part-time anyways.</p>
<p class="null-p">Master's invitation was like a delivery by a stork."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A delivery by a carrier pigeon."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san corrected her so quickly I could not even react. I did not think she had that capability….</p>
<p class="null-p">And not a shabby one, at that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's after class, so I can finally get some crush-eye."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. Exactly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, wait. You should be correcting her there, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is so scary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry-. No matter what happens, Hime-chan will protect Master's body," and then Hime-chan closed her eyes. "Good night."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she laid down on her side of the seat. I worried that her uniform would get creases for a moment, but, I suppose that is what you would call being over-protective. "What a good girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san teased.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. well, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a good girl. Why is Ichihime-chan such a good girl," Kasugai-san continued. "I wonder what reason there might be."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….." What are you trying to say? This person has a tendency to hold back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um…. I am driving, could you not speak to me that much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A good human being -- in many cases virtuous human beings are often generally deliberately virtuous ," A lot of them are good human beings," Kasugai-san continued, as if my words were such a passing wind that they were not worth lending an ear to. "Good human beings that come naturally -- in many cases are just pure evil. Exactly like Kunagisa Tomo and Utsurigi</p>
<p class="null-p">Gaisuke last month."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, spare me the talk of Utsurigi-san…." I seriously uttered. "That person is seriously traumatizing. He shows up in my dreams sometimes…. it is still mind-boggling, that Kunagisa commanded eight people like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Commanded."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Commanded is a good word. Maybe the best of words, and no good word ever dies."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. so, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing," Kasugai-san said, and then she closed her eyes. "I shall sleep as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. alright then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Is your brain running at 41 degrees Celsius?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why do you always sound like you have a point?</p>
<p class="null-p">It is awkward driving with your passenger seat being slept in. But, it sounds better than having snide remarks all along.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will wake you up if anything happens."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't."</p>
<p class="null-p">She ordered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you wake this Kasugai Kasuga up, bad things will happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bad things…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Zzzzzz."</p>
<p class="null-p">She slept.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite what she said…. it is beyond impossible for me to do something as artistic as waking up someone who is not asleep. I am not some elder sage. I decided to focus on driving. Plenty of fuel in the tank. Miiko-san must have refilled it today. Really, that person takes care of me much too well.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Inoji', Miiko-san said when she handed me the key to the Fiat. 'I don't know why but I have a really bad feeling.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'A bad feeling?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Well…. you'll probably be fine regardless of how much I worry' Miiko-san said. 'But even so, I think you should take the utmost precautions.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Uh huh….'</p>
<p class="null-p">'That said, researching not dying sounds good' Miiko-san smiled with just her lips. 'In swordsmanship, we only have the one getting stronger thing.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'There is nothing wrong with that, though.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'What's necessary for living?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Huh?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'What's necessary for living?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ummmmm….?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'To live, you must stay alive, Miiko-san seemed to say without emotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, try hard to stay alive.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Uh huh.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Stay alive, and come home.'</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded, but I did not nod because I understood what Miiko-san was trying to say. I just felt the need to nod. There are not many that would surpass me at sensing these sorts of needs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, today, on the 15th of August, Miiko-san still could not find work, and seemed to be resigned when it came to the scroll. If Miiko-san were to give up, my plans would also require changes. So, I will probably need to come up with something…. but what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">After traveling east on Imadegawa, I turned north again on the intersection with Kamogawa. All that was left was to drive north for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san and Hime-chan were both fast asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely, defenseless.</p>
<p class="null-p">I personally absolutely detest showing other people my sleeping self, and that largely held true even for humans I knew. That was why I had some level of sleep deprivation over the three weeks since Kasugai-san had rolled into my room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not that sleep deprivation is a problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">But do these two not have that concern?</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometimes, I do think.</p>
<p class="null-p">That I do overthink a lot of things, and that I am excessively self-conscious and paranoid, and that perhaps, if I could take things less seriously, that maybe I could live with less worries.</p>
<p class="null-p">As they say, choose not your friends, but your enemies.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, that can be called miraculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or perhaps curious.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, despite all that is said and done, if you believed every person you met, you would also eventually have your rug pulled out from under your feet by someone somewhere. I would not need to worry about such things if the world were truly filled with virtuous people.</p>
<p class="null-p">And I would not have become this sort of human being.</p>
<p class="null-p">And something like myself would not exist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, or perhaps.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometime somewhere, definitely.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you want to call that destiny or inevitability or karma or fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that truly cannot be escaped from--</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. maybe it is nonsense."</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not have much confidence in my usual line.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which was, of course, nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">It was exactly an hour later that we arrived at the place specified by Assistant Professor Kigamine. Five o'clock in the evening. It was a pretty good time given the Fiat's horsepower. Five in the evening, the sky was still bright. I thought about what time it might be that we get home after going through the test. Hime-chan still had class tomorrow, so it would be preferable not to be too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">Saitou Clinic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Read a small sign. Kigamine had told me to use that as a landmark. But that sign seemed to be very old, and it was both di cult to read and on the verge of crumbling. Probably, or rather, certainly, that must be a remnant of when this place functioned as a clinic. Though when it comes to the word remnant , I think of it as a word that unconditionally strikes at your sense of nostalgia, and so I do not like it much. When I came closer to the gate, I found a piece of vinyl tape posted on the mailbox with small text printed on it reading Kouto University Research Center as if it were just to cover one's ass. It felt extremely cheaply done. Or perhaps you could call it, perfunctory. I could imagine some people mistakenly coming here for medical care. However, once you got past the gate, what awaited you was quite the building indeed. Two stories, like an above-average sized single-family home. It was built with wood, not concrete. Assistant Professor Kigamine had used the word reconstructed , but you could also simply say that this was preserved well. It was probably the inside that had been repaired.</p>
<p class="null-p">I passed under the gate and into the parking lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had said to take the right…. but because I am ambidextrous, I actually am poor at remembering left and right. For someone ambidextrous, the rare occasion in one's daily life that one must distinguish between left and right was a defect that could not be avoided. I thought a little about how it must feel to be left handed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The parking lot was not that spacious, fitting four or five cars at most. And in that not-very-spacious lot was parked a Katana and a Z. Prior visitors…. or rather, one probably belonged to Kigamine. Yet assuming that is the case, what about the other? And they drove a type of car, whether it be the Katana or the Z, that you did not see very often. Well, not that it matters to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I backed the Fiat into a parking space.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san and Hime-chan remained asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After pondering it for a moment, I sounded the horn.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them jumped awake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. Master…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was given a grudge-filled look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. purple mirror purple mirror purple mirror…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was being cursed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, is that what she meant by bad things?</p>
<p class="null-p">Granted, I am turning twenty next year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let us go. Grab your bags, hurry up and get o ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes yes…." "Mmkay."</p>
<p class="null-p">I locked the doors, and then turned to the front entrance. As they followed, Kasugai-san stared at the building and Hime-chan glanced every which way.</p>
<p class="null-p">The front door opened sideways.</p>
<p class="null-p">It also had an intercom, so I pressed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a moment, a voice came from the speaker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I am here, as promised."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…. I had already predicted beforehand that you would be arriving just about now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Come on, you definitely didn't know who I was just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">You are definitely just saying that for the sake of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, please wait a moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Click, I heard her hang up.</p>
<p class="null-p">We were left with a meaningless silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. not that it matters but this is very analog architecture," Kasugai-san said behind me. "Not digital in the slightest. I feel like there must have been a little more care taken for facilities and equipment…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really think you should stop comparing everything to Professor Kyouichirou's laboratory," I turned to Kasugai-san. "Everyone and everywhere does not have the luxury of the backing of the Kunagisa</p>
<p class="null-p">Syndicate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not what I meant. There's…. something strange here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something strange?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you feel anything Hime-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san asked Hime-chan, who looked startled before pondering for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing strange, especially."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's Master after all, I thought we'd be pulled into another weird problem, so I'm a bit bummed. I don't see any traps."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Traps…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, I had no idea that was what she was doing. That must be why she was glancing every which way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Old habits die hard, it seems.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I'm Master's bodyguard this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You do not need to be so amped up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Aikawa-san had called upon her directly, so I can understand why she wants to put so much e ort into it…. anyways, I wonder what Aikawa-san's bad feeling meant. Even if unintentional, she had used the same words as</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san….</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine Yaku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san reacted to that name.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same way as the man with the fox mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I see….</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I be wary of them, too?</p>
<p class="null-p">If we have ----a connection.</p>
<p class="null-p">And if we did not, that was all.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, is that even possible….</p>
<p class="null-p">Is such a happening even possible in my life?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is such a Story even possible in this world?</p>
<p class="null-p">I do not know.</p>
<p class="null-p">I do not know, even, if I am supposed to know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Impossible to calculate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Impossible to calculate, even, if there is a conspiracy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rumble rumble rumble….</p>
<p class="null-p">The door opened sideways.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had gone ahead and assumed that Assistant Professor Kigamine would show up there--</p>
<p class="null-p">But a young girl appeared, instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably around high school aged.</p>
<p class="null-p">Long, black hair, with a light-blue blazer and necktie. Was this a uniform for a high school…. I could not tell. She had an appearance that would be described more as beautiful than cute, more woman than girl despite her age, with somewhat drooping sanpaku eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a lack of energy to her speech, like flat soda.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been waiting. Please, come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. ah, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, I was overawed by her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She quickly returned indoors, and I hurriedly took o my shoes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san and Hime-chan likewise entered the foyer, and took o their shoes. The girl prepared slippers for the three of us, and then motioned,</p>
<p class="null-p">"this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl slid open a fusuma after we walked down the hallway for a bit. And then she shut it behind us. We stepped into a Japanese-style room complete with tatami. It reminded me of the restaurant from yesterday, but of course, it was much smaller in scale, and bland without any decorations. You could say it felt very old. The girl deftly prepared enough cushions for us all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go get some tea. Please make yourselves at home."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, she exited out into the hallway, closing the fusuma behind her without a sound. We put down our belongings, and then sat on the cushions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who was that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. um, I do not know…."</p>
<p class="null-p">She could not be a university student at that age…. wait, did Koudai have any restrictions for skipping grades? She could be someone like Kokoromi-sensei…. wait wait, she was totally wearing a blazer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if she is Assistant Professor Kigamine's daughter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She has one?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows…."</p>
<p class="null-p">But Kigamine did not seem the age to have a child of that age…. yet she did not look like a sibling. Plus, they looked nothing alike. I thought of asking Hime-chan for her opinion, but she was busy struggling with getting into a proper seiza posture. I praised her for her e ort, but I told her, "you can sit normally, Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl came back quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, I had gone ahead and assumed we would simply be getting green tea in some mugs, but she instead placed good-smelling black tea in elegant teacups that looked like they belonged on a proper wooden tea table. "Sensei is attending to another guest right now. I'm sorry, but could you wait a few minutes here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">Another guest….?</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably the Katana or the Z in the parking lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see, that makes sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Madoka Kuchiha."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl introduced herself, bowing her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. you could say that I live here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You live here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san asked back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…. sensei only comes here to do lab work," the girl, Kuchiha-chan answered. "What…. would you call it. Pretend caretaking? Because houses wear down when no one lives in them."</p>
<p class="null-p">She referred to the Assistant Professor as sensei.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So…. what is your relation with the Assistant Professor…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you people,"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan mostly forcibly ignored my question, and instead asked back. "Understand what this place is for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understand what they do here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard it was researching not dying ," Kasugai-san answered. She was surprisingly well-behaved given that she was speaking to a younger girl. "I'm a zoologist-- a biologist. I came because I was intrigued." "…. hmm. A biologist--," Kuchiha-chan looked observant as she looked over Kasugai-san, then Hime-chan, and finally me. "And…. a university student, and a high school girl…. a strange group. A university student…. well, not that it matters."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, Kuchiha-chan wrapped her long hair around her finger. She wasn't very well behaved. It was as if we were no longer of interest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I ask a question?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Said Kasugai to Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">The tone was as polite as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go ahead." Kuchiha-chan nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you going to school?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a very roundabout question."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan provocatively laughed out loud.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it were to me or to Hime-chan it would be fine, but it seemed quite rude towards the older Kasugai-san. Rather than the arrogance peculiar to a girl, Kuchiha-chan's attitude was more twisted or faded, as if making fun of the world itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the face of someone that really wants to ask something else. Well, I don't really care either way, but… I don't go to school because I don't have to go. Are you satisfied with this answer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..yes," Kasugai did not change her attitude towards Kuchiha-chan, but only nodded at the answer. "Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kasugai-san?" I asked Kasugai-san in a whisper so that it did not reach Kuchiha-chan. "What's wrong? Something has been strange since a while ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I wonder what it is," Kasugai said something vaguely. "Somehow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know what it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's very uncomfortable to hear a secret story being told in front of me,"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan said in a relentless tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you do it somewhere else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"... Sorry," I apologized. "I apologize if you're o ended."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You caught the interest of the teacher." Kuchiha-chan's eyes, as she looked here, seemed to blame me, without an ounce of reluctance. "...The other two are extras, huh… she certainly looks like a doctor. I wonder if it's the appearance. Hey you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know your eyes very well. Those eyes that don't think of anyone else. Disgusting eyes. Really, disgusting eyes." Kuchiha-chan smiled and mocked. "Eyes that don't put others in their calculations from the beginning, eyes that perceive them as an element of the scenery. More background than scenery. You don't acknowledge others' will."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what, at the first meeting, there is no reason to be told that by a younger girl. If Kasugai-san and Hime-chan were not watching, even I would be saying o ensive words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Others are replaceable for you. Everything is everything's alternative. For example, if those two were di erent characters, it wouldn't be a problem for you. Did I guess right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are saying whatever you want… I don't think about humans in edit mode."</p>
<p class="null-p">" You're -----similar ." Kuchiha-chan said in a mocking tone. "I see. Thats why… that's why you caught sensei's interest. But, although similar… it's a terribly extreme form. The ultimate distortion, that's quite severely farfetched. You could even say it's warped."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you, you've got a very big attitude but you know---"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Firmly, Kuchiha commanded me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was being controlled, damn it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensei will soon be here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh ...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after Kuchiha-chan said that, the sliding door really moved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Behind the sliding door was Assistant professor Kigamine, and Niounomiya Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry I made you wait,"</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine said to us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, despite having called you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, I had forgotten the conversation so far, and my eyes were fixed on Rizumu-chan. Kasugai was the same. Hime-chan… didn't know the appearance of Rizumu-chan. She didn't know the black hair, glasses, manteau, or the straight-jacket underneath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine-san noticed our gazes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, this is a graduate student at Ritsumeikan University, Yukimura</p>
<p class="null-p">Touka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, aaaaaaaah!" Rizumu-chan raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stupid! This girl is an idiot!</p>
<p class="null-p">In a quick decision, Kasugai-san and I suppressed our surprise and pretended not to know her, but this girl was!</p>
<p class="null-p">The assistant professor Kigamine, Hime-chan, and also Kuchiha-chan, looked suspiciously at Yukimura Touka alias Niounomiya Rizumu. It seems that even Rizumu-chan had understood, "ah, aah, aaaaaah, aaaa-----", and she was lost.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, how will you dodge this.</p>
<p class="null-p">How will you respond to this crisis, Carnival !</p>
<p class="null-p">"...iuoe-, just joking!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the worst possible response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………" "………………" "………………" "………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………" "………………" "………………" "………………" "………………" "………………" "………………" "………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence mixed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahem, Assistant Professor Kigamine coughed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a graduate student from Roushisha University, Yukimura</p>
<p class="null-p">Touko-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, as expected of a faculty member at a national university, she dealt well with the strange behavior of the eccentric. Gracefully, she cancelled the time that had stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like you, she came to take the aptitude test as a monitor." "...I see" I listened to the words of Assistant Professor Kigamine, while being cautious to not act unnaturally. "Aren't the monitors just us? It felt like you were saying that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's right… but well, this girl is a special case" said Kigamine in a somewhat badly enounced way. "I apologize for doing what I did. It was a sudden decision… but there isn't any problem, is there? I just thought I should have one more monitor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure, that's no problem for me, so I don't mind……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yu, yu yu yu yu Yukimura Touko," Yukimura Touko alias Niounomiya</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu said in a shaky voice that still couldn't hide her surprise. "ni, nice to meet you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...yeah. Likewise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now… Kuchiha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine talked to Kuchiha-chan. Listening to that,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan answered "yes" and stood up quietly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, sensei?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Help me with the preparations. Could you guys wait here for a little longer?</p>
<p class="null-p">We're going to prepare for the exam there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand," I answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yukimura-san……..you too, stay here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yukimura Touko alias Niounomiya Rizumu nodded and sat down in the place where Kuchiha was sitting before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… this preparation should be done in about ten minutes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine said so, and Kuchiha-chan, saying nothing, passed to the other side of the doorstep, and closed the sliding doors silently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm….</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, it is the same as the impression when we met before, Assistant Professor Kigamine, a person like a robot-------it was just like she was saying a fixed dialogue programmed beforehand. Of course it's probably not that, but it just seems to be able to explain her personality to the extent that it gives that impression to others. Counting our conversation on the phone, this was only our fourth contact, but each time the impression just deepened.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, the four remaining people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….." (I)</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….." (Kasugai-san)</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….." (Rizumu-chan)</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….." (I)</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….." (Kasugai-san)</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….." (Rizumu-chan)</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess, I'll feign ignorance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yukimura… Touko-san, is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y, yes!" Yukimura Touko alias Niounomiya Rizumu…..or rather</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan answered. "Yukimura Touko!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I see.</p>
<p class="null-p">She intends to feign ignorance.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's guts that I respect, let's buy it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Buy, and resell immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm in a position where I resell the fight I pick.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You being a graduate student means that you are older than me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! Of course!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How old are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"22 years old!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't look like it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I'm dressing younger than my age!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because you're a lolicon!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems she doesn't know the meaning of those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">A little embarrassing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yukimura…" I planned a little. "If your last name has been Yukimura since you were born, naturally you'd be able to say the names of the Sanada Ten</p>
<p class="null-p">Braves in order, I guess everyone can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Incidentally, I can. Saizou, Sasuke, Anayama Kosuke. The priests Miyoshi</p>
<p class="null-p">Seikai and Isa, Mochizuki Rokuro and Unno Rokuro, Nezu Jinpachi and</p>
<p class="null-p">Kakei Juuzo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyann!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan showed her decisive mistake as a true culprit spotted by a great detective.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Huh. But Onii-san, you've only mentioned nine names right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who is the last person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not Youaltepuztli, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">I think it was a name like the great detective Masafumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Foolish girl. You forgot to count Sanada Yukimura."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh, what! That's right! What a simple trick!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, it sounded like the police chief that was being played with by the thief.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, aren't you a great detective?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, I'm gonna go out for a bit." I got up, grabbed Rizumu's manteau, lifted her up like a cat, forced her to stand, and told Kasugai-san and Hime-chan. "If assistant professor Kigamine comes back, please make her wait. I count on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger. Have a good trip."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master, do you know that person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai skillfully tried to look the other way, but Hime-chan attacked sharply. As expected, Hime-chan is not just a dumb girl. I----I said to</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, something like that. I have a bit of… a connection with</p>
<p class="null-p">Yukimura-san." I made eye contact with Kasugai. "Right, Kasugai-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh. Oh I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">She acted like an outsider.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't know at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I didn't know about the exquisite blend of crisp, refreshing, clear, crisp, crisp, clear, crisp, clear plating, moist, refreshing and refreshing." "Is that so………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Traitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll call you Judas Kasugai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, Yukimura-san? Please come this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">I dragged out Rizumu-chan out into the corridor, went back on the way guided by Kuchiha-chan, and then got out of the building.</p>
<p class="null-p">We moved to the parking lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I arrived in front of the Fiat, I turned around towards Rizumu-chan, who came quietly from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um ... detective activity?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu answered me with a cute smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, really cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Great detective activity?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't correct yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiyan…." Rizumu-chan looked up at me, shaking like a pathetic prey hunted down by a predator. Apparently, I looked like a bad guy. "I was just asked to by Mister Fox."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mister Fox…."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">That person?</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly yesterday, he apparently had an extraordinary interest in the name of Assistant Professor Kigamine. Yeah, now that I think about it, I didn't mention at the time that I worked here. So, I wonder if Rizumu-chan was surprised earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…After finishing your search for someone, you took a new job?</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's it." Rizumu smiled and answered. "Go infiltrate this laboratory, he said..…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Infiltration investigation…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Becoming a Roushisha graduate as a means. Really, that's quite something. Probably someone asked an important person from Roushisha to write a letter of introduction, well she calls herself a great detective, so she must have at least that level of influence…. Even so, it's only a story from yesterday. No matter what, it's too fast.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, wait wait.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's not it.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl's claim of being a great detective , is no more than a disguise, and lurking behind it is---------</p>
<p class="null-p">Man Eater .</p>
<p class="null-p">I stepped back unconsciously, one step away from Rizumu-chan. In response, Rizumu-chan tilted her head, "Hiyan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">-------Rizumu-chan doesn't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is lurking inside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is the meaning of puppet .</p>
<p class="null-p">"When Mister Fox heard about Onii-san's story, I don't really know why but he seemed to be intrigued. I was conveniently looking for a part time job, so I barely managed to fit in, but I guess that was unreasonable. And to think that Onii-san was here--. I might be tied to Onii-san with an invisible thread---."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you connected via electromagnetic waves or something..….so now, where are you sleeping?" If I remember correctly, this area isn't her hometown. "Still living in a hotel?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. My work has been extended, so I went to a certain place with Mister</p>
<p class="null-p">Fox yesterday. He'll be taking care of me for a while. Hehe, the boss is harsh.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at the hotel, it costs money."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being a great detective is quite the plain job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say so…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="null-p">This seems to be a critical point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To begin with, what's with Yukimura Touko?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a pseudonym. It's a good name, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm ... the name is about summer and winter, it's a name that makes you think of an inconsequential character so it seems to be appropriate for a pseudonym…. I don't know why but there's that nuance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, please be silent, Onii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's between Onii-san and me, right, right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of relation is that….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it's obviously better to stay silent. It's not good to say that there is a professional killer of the Niounomiya within such a short distance and alert Hime-chan. That girl, it's not too late for her yet, but it's not that stable and safe. In that sense, she's a dangerous bodyguard for me. However…. It's fine if she's really working as a detective , but if it's the back , I can't really keep it from Hime-chan..…. Even if I keep it quiet from assistant professor Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan, what should I do? Maybe tonight, after returning to the apartment I should consult with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's okay to stay silent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you! Onii-san, I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But there is a condition."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lewd stu is forbidden!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Your outfit is far from sexually appealing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm. I understand. Be gentle."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu gently closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hit her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It hurts!" Rizumu shouted. "Wha, what are you doing! I told you to be gentle! It's really scary to be hit when your eyes are closed, you know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're noisy."</p>
<p class="null-p">This month it's only been this type of person.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tell Rizumu, "You know" and then after a short pause.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The condition is that------I, after this interview, from the 22 nd for a period of a week, will work with you…. but if you're going to do something , I want you to do it after that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Otherwise, I won't get paid for the job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah…. then, that means I can do what I like after that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cheapskate!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly speaking, researching not dying , it's not like I'm not interested, but certainly for me now, money is more important… okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, understood." Rizumu smiled. "Then it's a pinky promise!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">How?</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I ask?</p>
<p class="null-p">It may not be unnatural to ask now but…...</p>
<p class="null-p">That straightjacket under the manteau .</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Hmm? Rizumu-chan. Then which one is it?" I pointed at the Katana and the Z. "Rizumu-chan's?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yay! Katana! I love it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Is this also something borrowed from the fox masked man? Rizumu doesn't seem like she's been just walking everywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really love all motorcycles!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speak ing of which, motorcycles are called autobikes, but what is a manual bike?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess it would be a bicycle." I replied without confidence. I never thought about that. "Do you have a license, Rizumu-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, onii-san. What are you talking about? I'm 16 years old!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">This Katana is a rather large motorcycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah… no, wait wait, that's not the point!</p>
<p class="null-p">How did she drive with the straitjacket!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ri, Rizumu-cha…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go back! Before the professor comes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not a professor but an assistant professor……..no, wait…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Professor assistant professor, police inspector assistant inspector, while doing the usual exchange, we returned inside the building. We walked down the corridor and returned to the Japanese-style room. Neither assistant professor Kigamine nor Kuchiha-chan were there yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome back." "Welcome back."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan and Kasugai-san were side by side, on a tatami mat, lying on a pillow on a cushion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though nobody is watching, this boldness….</p>
<p class="null-p">Not common.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master. What were you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not much. I just heard from Yukimura about the electrodynamics of a moving object."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really--" Hime-chan was impressed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really!?" Rizumu-chan was surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's your field, right. Yukimura-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please teach Hime-chan next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y, yes! Please leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu was full of herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">As we took our seats, Kasugai and Hime-chan corrected their postures, and</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine came back. There was no sight of</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry I made you wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant professor Kigamine said in a formal tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that we're ready, we'll start with a simple paper test……..so,</p>
<p class="null-p">Yukimura-san, Kasugai-san, Yukariki-san, please come with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…..." I involuntarily uttered at the words of assistant professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine. "Um, assistant professor Kigamine, I'm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're exempt from the exam." Assistant professor Kigamine said plainly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiring you is a decision that cannot be changed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay..…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Is that okay?</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of th e exam, I was called here today, and so when I was told that I was suddenly exempt I couldn't help but be confused. In the first place, assistant professor Kigamine herself said that the aptitude test included me. Assistant professor Kigamine, she's not Hime-chan, but is it alright to trust me so easily? It may be better to tell her the number of people who have had painful experiences because of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it just means that I'm getting that exemption, I'm not an honest grandfather. Only garbage is buried in the back field.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um…. about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Kasugai-san raised her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">The eyes of the other four people concentrated on Kasugai-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san's expression was as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What is it? Kasugai-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's hard to say but I've decided to return home." Kasugai-san said that and raised herself from the cushion. "So you'll excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…. hold on, Kasugai-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry Ikki." Kasugai-san looked at me. "This is my selfishness so you don't have to drive me back or anything. It's fine. I will walk home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Walk…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be a great distance from here.</p>
<p class="null-p">She'll have to cross the mountain, so even when we'll return with the Fiat after the exam, we'll arrive at the apartment first.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you remember something?" Assistant professor Kigamine looked at Kasugai strangely. "If it's urgent business, then the aptitude test can be done at a later date…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. That's not the case." Kasugai-san spoke in a very normal tone. "I just can't stand being in this place for one more second."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant professor Kigamine had a confused expression that showed that she could not understand what Kasugai had said. I probably looked somewhat similar to or approaching that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me for my rudeness but if I were to express it more thoroughly, I can't stand to breathe the same air as you for one more second."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…. Kasugai-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have nothing more to say." Kasugai-san said without any emotion and bowed straight. "So then…. How should I say this. Sorry if I bothered you."</p>
<p class="null-p">And Kasugai-san walked out of the room, passing by assistant professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine. "Wait!" I stood up without thinking and followed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the threshold, I almost crashed into assistant professor Kigamine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant professor Kigamine did not avoid it. Or rather, she wasn't even looking at me. Not looking at anyone, not looking at anything, just, she seemed to be digesting the words said by Kasugai-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I don't have time for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I passed by her side and ran down the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the entrance, Kasugai-san relaxed, neither hurrying nor waiting for me, at her own pace, walking leisurely and whistling, I succeeded in grabbing her arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..I like aggressive men quite a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No! What was that, now!" I yelled without thinking. I didn't mean that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That, that was rude…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rude? Rude. I guess so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But. I'm such a person. Since long ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Facial expression close to expressionless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reading her emotions is di cult.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, it was almost impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know what she's thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't understand people's feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">First of all, Kasugai did not seek understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is the di erence between this person and me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't care about others.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't care about the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">I think so.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai also surely thinks so.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kasugai-san understands that .</p>
<p class="null-p">As for me, I don't understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Self-awareness and self-confidence and perception and knowledge.</p>
<p class="null-p">The di erence seems similar, and tremendous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Me who wishes for despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san who is facing despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Di erent like the North Pole and South Pole.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san doesn't float like me.</p>
<p class="null-p">She is rooted in her understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not a di erence in level, it's a di erence in stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should know me well. At least I thought you did. It's just a whim…. I guess I would be happy if you didn't mind. Perhaps you could say something about whether I need to be happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such…. but."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like an aggressive man, but my arm will hurt soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">I apologized reflexively and released my hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san did not try to escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no reason to escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there is no reason not to escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right-------I had almost forgotten.</p>
<p class="null-p">This person is nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, nothing</p>
<p class="null-p">From every angle.</p>
<p class="null-p">By eliminating all beings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweeping away all beings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Absence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Too careless of an absence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Innocent.</p>
<p class="null-p">A too sinful, innocence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Just one thing." After seeing me shut up, Kasugai came closer. "Ikki. I think you should stop this part time job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"These words are not to my liking but--------</p>
<p class="null-p">---------- I have a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm…. yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Kasugai-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">I had heard that from Aikawa-san and Miiko-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, now.</p>
<p class="null-p">To hear those words from this person…….</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than the meaning, I felt that the essence was di erent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for the vagueness. But isn't that appropriate for you? Of course also for me." With a slap, as if to encourage me, Kasugai-san struck my chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, see ya."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh… um. If you really want to return, if you wait, we will go together…. walking from here, it will have to be through the night. It's a mountain path and it's dangerous-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad or not glad to hear you say that, but that's not good at all. It's not like I don't want to go home or not work. I just don't want to be here. It's not a reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please pick me up if you catch up in the mountains. You can ignore me if you want. Then, do your best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do my best, at what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Life or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san pushed me back with her hand on my chest. After receding a few steps, I regained my balance while Kasugai-san turned away and started walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she didn't look back anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without looking at Kasugai-san's back until it was no longer visible, I went back into the building .</p>
<p class="null-p">In this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san had removed her name from the cast of characters.</p>
<p class="null-p">3</p>
<p class="null-p">When I returned to the room, everyone was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan, who was missing earlier, was now sitting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant professor Kigamine was also waiting for me at the tea table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Master."</p>
<p class="null-p">When it was appropriate, Hime-chan asked first.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened to Kasugai-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She went home." I said firmly, but to not appear too serious, I lightened my tone. "Really, that person is so reckless…. She's the culmination of planning nothing, rather than not knowing what she's thinking, it feels more like she's not thinking about anything. She said she will walk home from here. Going over the mountain with such light clothing is crazy…. well, we'll just pick her up on the way back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan was clearly feeling down. She wasn't really close with Kasugai-san, but Hime-chan was such a girl. I couldn't help but turn towards assistant professor Kigamine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About that…. I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">I apologized for the time being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't really bother me." Kigamine laughed at me as if nothing had happened. "I had predicted beforehand that this would be possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….then, that's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Kasugai Kasuga." Assistant professor Kigamine said with a serious expression. "Speaking of Kasugai Kasuga, it's a name that I've heard of a little…. Despite her human problems, I appreciate her originality and eccentricity, and her overall design. I didn't think you were acquainted with such a wise person who had been a candidate for the Seven Fools…. honestly, I feel a little sad. You are exempt from the exam while she has to do the exam, I hope it did not hurt Kasugai-san's pride…. however…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She is not that type."</p>
<p class="null-p">This is true.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you ask what type she is, I'd be in trouble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the usual thing. Really, this is always the case. How should I say, she, her personality is similar to rolling dice… and also, kind of elusive." "…..Is that so. I do not understand why at all, but it seems that she hated it…. hey, Kuchiha."</p>
<p class="null-p">The assistant professor looked at Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, do you have an idea?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows..…." Kuchiha-chan, while trying to hide something with deliberate gestures, answered with an unnatural smile. "Sorry, sensei. I have no idea whatsoever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so..…. Well it's fine. Most of the time, biologists don't understand each other." Assistant professor Kigamine said. "It was really a saving in disguise that Yukimura-san came. Because of that we have secured the minimum number of people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan was smiling without care.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, shouldn't you have predicted this beforehand…...</p>
<p class="null-p">As I thought, you're saying that haphazardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, the exam will be taken by Yukimura-san and Yukariki-san…." Assistant professor Kigamine stood up and said. "Then this time for sure, please come this way…. if we don't start soon, we won't have enough time."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/zaregoto/illustrations/zaregoto_vol_06_11.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">0</p>
<p class="null-p">"I regret it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, regret it your whole life."</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">Natural.</p>
<p class="null-p">Neutral.</p>
<p class="null-p">A really solitary person is--------probably, with just that, a perfect person. Speaking of how to define the term 'perfect', in this case, the largest range is acceptable. If there is a concept that can live without relation to the world at all, it must be expressed as 'perfect' from any angle and from whatever observation. A perfect solitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">A solitary perfection.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is "not needing to eat".</p>
<p class="null-p">Plants cannot grow without the sun and water.</p>
<p class="null-p">If plants do not grow, animals cannot be born.</p>
<p class="null-p">Humans cannot live without eating animals.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without humans, humans cannot live.</p>
<p class="null-p">A person cannot live alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Loved, loved, eating each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a so-c alled food chain------the world is all about eating or being eaten in the first place. Being truly solitary or perfect is nothing more than trying to get out of that ring.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is nothing but an attempt to break out of causality.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, do not eat.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, do not be eaten.</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone who won't become someone's food, someone who won't make someone else their food.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without wanting, and without needing.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why----- a truly solitary person is perfect-------truly perfect, and so, that's why, they're a very lonely existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone who has nothing to do with anyone or anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, such 'perfection' is like dying at the moment of birth, an existence almost equal to zero------and never changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It can't change.</p>
<p class="null-p">It doesn't change.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is dry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without any moisture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"... That person is wise."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan said, without introduction</p>
<p class="null-p">"Name ... what was it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't measure the intent of the question, but I thought that its intent was just to ask for that name. "Kasugai Kasuga" I answered simply. "Hmm ... that's right," While hearing the answer to the question she asked,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan looked extraordinarily bored, and said listlessly. "By the way,</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder, what is your name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since when do you address me this familiarly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only a moment ago, even then, that treatment was more preferable. I was finally feeling fed up with this girl called Madoka Kuchiha. What is it, this… what do you call it, this feeling of indi erence . Well, I won't say that characters like Hime-chan or Rizumu-chan are common, but are all modern high school students like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">…..Huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">High school student?</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of that, I thought she was saying that she didn't go to school in response to Kasugai-san's question. Then why are you wearing a blazer?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Answer the question. What is your name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I'm sorry, but I don't give my name in public."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that. That's stupid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe. But humans, if they are living, don't they have one or two things that they cannot give out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" 'If they are living' huh…. you say some pretty interesting things. Sensible, quite a good feeling." Kuchiha-chan said as if it was interesting. "Umm ... Oh, yes. You were called Master or Ikki ... so that girl, is she your disciple?" "I'm a substitute…. That girl's master is someone else. I'm acting out the role of a tutor, so it's not like I can't be called master , but it's essentially di erent from what the word means, but it doesn't matter. As a guardian too, I'm a substitute."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuma Shisei. Jun Aikawa.</p>
<p class="null-p">For Hime-chan, I am their alternative.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have no particular thoughts about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's just what it is.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really feel like calling you master so I'll follow Kasugai-san and call you Ikki ." Kuchiha-chan says. "What do you want to call me? My recommendation is chippa ."</p>
<p class="null-p">>"…I don't feel like I'll get along with you so much to use a surname. I'm fine with Kuchiha-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuchiha-chan, huh…. it's also outstanding."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was cold enough to freeze.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the smile of a vampire.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….It's nonsense"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan and Rizumu-chan had been taken to a separate room by assistant professor Kigamine, and, since I came to be alone with</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan in this Japanese room, already thirty minutes had passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was exchanged was an unproductive conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unproductive, barren conversations.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, I wanted her to leave me alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">First of all, this girl, when I talk to her, she never tries to look away from my eyes. As if peeking at the bottom of my heart. Kuchiha-chan said my eyes were unpleasant eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">In my opinion, Kuchiha-chan's gouging eyes are much, much more so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ikki…...you." Kuchiha-chan said in a tone that seemed to be unaltered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, you don't want to die?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know what you're saying. Although our ages should not be so far apart that I feel a generational gap."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does it seem so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, so answer the question. Do you not want to die so much that you showed interest in this, this boastful and capricious and fantastical and delusional and ultimate topic of "researching not dying"?" "….That's, well, I'm somewhat interested in the research itself." I shrugged. "But my ultimate goal is just to get money. I need some pocket change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Materialist."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was told as if it was being spit out.</p>
<p class="null-p">…...Is it that bad for college students to work part-time during summer vacation? Even so, you have no right to say that as the employer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't help it. I need money, so I have to work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such pragmatic materialism."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was scorned by those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">……….</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't that a bad pun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…. surely you don't seem to 'not want to die'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad you understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your eyes are eyes that want to die." Kuchiha-chan said. "Hoping for destruction…. not just your own destruction, but the thorough destruction of the world. Eternal destruction. The destruction of destiny itself, you wish for the destruction of destruction."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Far from being an a rmation, I was persuaded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My eyes, like the eyes of a dead fish, the eyes of a traitor, the eyes of a man wanting to die, it's hard being told all that…. even though I only have two." "You…. root and mix everything. Like a tornado. You end up doing it unconsciously…. and maybe almost consciously. I wonder if it's more of a crime of passion than a conscious crime." Kuchiha-chan showed no reaction to my attempt at self-concealment. "At least, you've always done that until now…. am I wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know…. at your age, I understand that it's fun for you to talk like you can see through people, but you're entirely o the mark."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O the mark? Is that really the case?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, you're rather humorous now. Just like an elementary school student who is pleased to hit a home run in soft tennis. I don't know what you've heard from Assistant Professor Kigamine, but she seems to have misunderstood something. In general, most of the trouble that occurs around me, those are phenomena that result from overestimating me. If Kuchiha-chan doesn't want to be in danger today and then through next week, it's better not to talk too much about me without even knowing me.</p>
<p class="null-p">You don't have to worry about me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't even know…. huh. Certainly I don't know you, but I know a similar person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Similar person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Earlier….. Didn't she say that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Similar, and.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see. He was in terms of human nature-----</p>
<p class="null-p">----------Humanity's Worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humanity's…. Worst?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder, can you understand? The meaning of being told to be similar to humanity's worst." Kuchiha-chan, in a nasty way of talking, sent me a gaze that looked down on me. "Though…. When he and I met, it was before he became the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..And I'm similar to how he was before ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows…. how was it, I wonder. You're not a child, so why not think about it for yourself?" Speaking in a faint tone, Kuchiha-chan turned to face the old clock on the wall. "The exam, including the oral exam, takes about an hour."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…. oh, yes." The conversation took another turn. It was too abrupt and I was a little confused. "Hime-chan and…. Yukimura-san right. Hmm, it takes that much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Part time jobs are not such an easy thing…. the job being what it is, you can't really cut corners just because you're a monitor. Rather, you definitely have to take it seriously. It's essentially impossible to be exempt from the aptitude test like you were. Do you understand how much of an exception you are?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And saying 'you don't have to worry about me'…. you are astonishingly self-centered. You'd better redefine yourself a little more boldly…. I'll advise you that it might be wiser to know what an influence your existence has…...that Kasugai-san from earlier, she seemed to have a good understanding about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about you…." I just couldn't stand it, so I tried to fight back. "What about you? You're saying what you want, but isn't that harsh? What e ect each word has on me…. if you can't imagine at all, then it's just due to a lack of imagination."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't a ect anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Extremely clearly, Kuchiha-chan said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know...…. you, follow me for a bit." Kuchiha-chan, and stood up. "You're similar to him so I'll teach you something good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…. Kuchiha-chan?" Something good? "No, if it's just talking, here is fine….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't really matter to me or to you where we do it, but I don't want other people to hear. Japanese people have always been open minded, so you can think of creating a closed room by separating the space with such a sliding door…. but it's a delusion to think that closed rooms exist in this world. I know, let's go outside."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I don't have anything to talk with you about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan's gesture felt provocative.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't take the provocation and, carefully and cautiously, spun my words with care.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know. Kuchiha-chan. Don't you think your attitude has been too self-important for a while now? I don't know if you're the caretaker of this lab or anything, but being told all of that without reservation is tough for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Scary, right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….That's not the problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then saying it like this might arouse your interest -------you, more or less, to some extent, have an interest in sensei's 'researching not dying'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan stood up quietly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Ikki…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan called me and smiled at me with a bewitching smile not befitting of her age.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you know why I am here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way you know, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, she laughed again.</p>
<p class="null-p">-----Why?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why does this girl laugh like this? Why does she have such an expression on her face? Why does she speak like that? If this was a decade later, if she was an adult, it might have been seductive but----now, even if you do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though the meaning cannot help but be distorted and unbalanced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Terribly improper.</p>
<p class="null-p">Terribly imbalanced.</p>
<p class="null-p">She.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, Ikki."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan said with frightening gentleness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My body doesn't die."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without waiting for my reaction, Kuchiha-chan turned her back, opened the sliding door, went out into the corridor, and closed it shut. I couldn't respond, as if time had stopped for a moment------no, not for just a moment. Intuitively, I felt it was a long time, I was frozen there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Returning to my senses, I got up and went out into the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan could no longer be found. Which way? She said she'd go out? Then, it's the entrance. Thinking that this would be my second round trip, I put on my shoes and opened the door to the outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if I looked around the parking lot, I couldn't find Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh…….. was it the wrong direction?</p>
<p class="null-p">No, if there is a front then there is a back. I passed through the parking lot, passing in front of the Fiat, the Katana and the Z (thinking about it, this is too good of a spectacle to pass by. Let's take a closer look later) and slowly bypassed the building. There was a little garden on the opposite side of the parking lot. Even with inexperienced eyes, you could see that the grass had been cut and well cared for.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan sat on a rock placed there with her legs crossed. She wasn't looking at me, but with a somewhat thoughtful expression, looked at the setting sun in the reddish western sky with a vacant stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked awfully ephemeral.</p>
<p class="null-p">Enough to make me hesitate to call out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a fragile sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan noticed me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression looked surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..I didn't think you would come."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying it's strange. You seem simple, but at the bottom it's really cloudy and invisible. You are truly wise and clever so I did not think you were the type to stick your neck into superfluous matters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you're the type to stick your neck into ruin and destruction…. or maybe it's your feet and not your neck? At least you're not like a cat killed by curiosity. Cat? I see, cats are good. Hey, do you know If 6 Was 9 ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess. It's that kind of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't get it. What are you saying? More importantly…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think of this world?" Kuchiha-chan asked in a manner that did not seem to be seeking an answer at all. "If you asked me….. this world is a heap of garbage. A loot box packed only with garbage that can't be reused, a demon's yaminabe party in hell, even Pandora's box seems cute in comparison. A fair trade that is not even evil. A Babel's prison where the worst and calamities are accumulated. Above all, what's laughable is that this pile of garbage is collected properly according to the rules."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fate and inevitability and causality and destiny are….. certainly, foolish.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a comically high-end model which is essential for this world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan said while looking up at the sky before I could catch up. "Even if there is such a thing….. even if there was such a thing, it is better not to know----right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe…." I answered vaguely, hoping to dodge Kuchiha-chan's words. "At least, Kuchiha-chan. I'll finally answer your first question now…. I don't particularly want to die. It might be a bit di erent than not wanting to die, but that's the answer. It doesn't matter to me if I die, but I don't particularly want to die."</p>
<p class="null-p">Really.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why am I having such a conversation?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's ridiculous like a collection of questions solved repeatedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">How many times did I say the same thing?</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter the person, I say the same thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see, in that sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan has absolutely no influence on me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's easy to say that you can live and die, but….. don't you need a lot of energy to die? No it's not really 'su cient'. Killing humans requires overwhelming violence or excellent skill. Did you know? Human beings can live up to 120 years. It takes a whole 120 years for just one person to die. If you have that much time, ten generations of bacteria have evolved. To make something useless durable, there's no way it's easy. At the very least, it's not an easy condition you can clear just by wanting to die, it's natural to not want to die, but things that can't die won't die."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if the person wishes for it deeply?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If the person wishes for it deeply-----it's not impossible. For example, jumping to death. If you take a step, you die easily. Easy, easy, really simple. People die easily…. you can cut your wrists without any problem. You can drink poison without any problem. You can choose what gas to fill yourself up with according to your preference, you can do whatever you want, but----- if you can do that , is another story."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"People who can commit suicide are strong."</p>
<p class="null-p">Most people----</p>
<p class="null-p">Humans cannot die, they just crawl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Squirming, su ering, struggling in vain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Crawling, and just living.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then….. according to you." Kuchiha-chan changed her tone. Somehow soft, at least I felt the thorns were missing. "I wonder if sensei's research is meaningless. Even if you don't want to not die , since you don't die that easily, that would be the reasoning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe…. don't ask too seriously. Are you surprisingly obedient? You don't have to take what I say seriously. My words are, without exception, all just nonsense after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nonsense?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a nonsense user."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said in a soft tone. Apparently that pleased her, Kuchiha-chan coughed as if laughing. It wasn't as cynical as it used to be, just an ordinary smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">That ordinary smile suited her well.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It takes immense energy to die, huh…. if that's the case." Kuchiha-chan lifted her back from the rock and approached me. Until the closest distance, in the blink of an eye, there was no use arguing about it. "If that's the case, I have zero energy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You came to talk about that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right….. but what kind of metaphor is that?" I took one step back. Despite being younger, unlike Hime-chan and Rizumu-chan, if you can get that close to a girl who is growing normally, you can't be completely composed. Not dying ….. is that something related to Assistant Professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine's research?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not related------I'm not talking about such a stale level. I'm that person's research material ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it easier to understand as an experimental subject?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Experiment--------subject?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Research…..material?</p>
<p class="null-p">What------kind of metaphor is that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan continued talking to the confused me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well….what should I say? Sensei would not be able to continue the research without me….I needed a place to live and someone to take care of me….our interests were both aligned."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Matching…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Resembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">The laboratory of Dr. Shadou Kyouichirou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there-------- a man was taken prisoner.</p>
<p class="null-p">His name was Utsurigi Gaisuke.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had outstanding brains, and terrifying arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was‐‐ research material.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You have a face like I'm doing something inhuman." Kuchiha-chan gently touched my cheek. Before I knew it she had reduced the distance again, but Kuchiha-chan continued regardless. "What? Do you have an acquaintance who had a similar experience?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, there's….no such thing. Just, but, Assistant Professor Kigamine…."</p>
<p class="null-p">" She's still on the better side . Or did you think that Assistant Professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine was someone who appeared in the Bible? That's laughable." Kuchiha-chan laughed. It was very derisive laughter. "A scholar expecting good sense from his race….the thirst for knowledge is the most violent thing excluding violence in this world, the worst violence owned."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, in other respects, Assistant Professor Kigamine is a good person. At any rate, she doesn't interfere. I really like them, those kinds of people." "….Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess it's a half-love half-hate…. and our relationship is quite lengthy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides------- this is a good place ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, a good environment. Hey, Ikki. You talked a lot about death earlier, but…. I want to hear your opinion. What do you think not dying is?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was asked for an answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, an answer was expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought and chose my words carefully. Since I'm the nonsense user, I shouldn't fail to select my words here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the very least….I know that not dying is not equal to living . I won't say that if you don't have a meaningful life, or a life with an objective, you have a meaningless life but….that in essence, life and death are two sides of the same coin, that is, they are the same existence, denial of life is death, and denial of death is life, I cannot say that. At least, there are conditions that are not fulfilled."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a cowardly answer." Kuchiha-chan was still merciless here. "Answering a question with a negative, is almost the most cowardly way of doing things. You're not saying anything in the end. Does nonsense user mean coward?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not wrong, in general. But, it's only half correct. It's an overestimation, because cowards can cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does that mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a liar if you stand and a swindler if you sit, and walking is sophistry------that's what a nonsense user is. If you do that kind of thing, it means that you'll only about half invade the territory of cowards." After taking a breath I asked Kuchiha-chan. "So? What does not dying really mean? Your opinion on the undying body ."</p>
<p class="null-p">" To never die means to have nothing to do with anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without hesitation, as if she had prepared that line for a long time,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To have nothing to do with anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing------with anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">No relations?</p>
<p class="null-p">Complete solitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is…. not dying?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Forever and forever, n o matter what happens, no matter who they meet or who they leave, fate and inevitability and causality and destiny, whether or not that ri ra exists, whether or not such evil spirits exist, without relation to the flow of the story--------</p>
<p class="null-p">never changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what it means to not die ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not changing…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For what reason was it born? With what meaning was it born? Not having an answer to these two questions--------that's an undying body . No matter how much time passes, no matter where you go, no matter how long you go, no matter what you say, it's always the same. That not dying…. what you said earlier, that was really good. The thing about death taking a lot of energy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…..is that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, energy will be exhausted, right? If we follow the law of conservation, energy is generally changing ? If you don't have Maxwell's demon come out, having a portion of energy fixed in a rigorous meaning, is impossible. That's why-----I have zero energy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that is, a metaphor…."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a metaphor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, that's not a metaphor?</p>
<p class="null-p">Really----------is it an undying body?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Too ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">What normalcy am I trying to grasp.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't it me who is taking her seriously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That said, if the energy is zero, it doesn't mean you're alive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I just don't die. I just don't die. I'm not alive... so I don't die."</p>
<p class="null-p">If you're living , you will always die .</p>
<p class="null-p">If you are not alive, you will not die.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is…...easy to understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Easy and clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's clear but…...even if it's clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know. If Kuchiha-chan really won't die …. if that's the case, since when have you been alive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't remember." Kuchiha-chan answered with a bored tone. Just as if she's been receiving such questions a lot and has become tired of answering them. "It's been so long that I can't remember…. how is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a model answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks like you don't believe me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Believing it or not is up to you….but Ikki, you, the meaning of why you were invited here, your exemption from the aptitude test, do you know the reason why you're receiving what is by no means a small amount of money?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She chuckled and laughed at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, it was a derisive laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a strange story. Aren't you being tricked by the word monitor? Hiring someone who has no expert knowledge and whose field is di erent, I don't know what kind of reason sensei used to forcibly persuade you but normally that's not done. If you think about it with common sense, there is no reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason….Assistant Professor Kigamine heard about me somewhere, investigated somewhere….and, it seemed interesting. Though, I think she overestimated me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Overestimation, overestimation..….can you only say the same thing? Round and round the same place, what are you, a clock?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're good at retorting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tease me. The reason why sensei gives you such preferential treatment-----that is, because you're like him . The reason why you are interesting, I can't say there is none of that but….your career and your history, before all of that, it's because you are like him ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that sense, this is a suitability test. Your interview with me. But you could say it's more like a police lineup."</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh….speaking of which.</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day, Assistant Professor Kigamine gave me various explanations but the fundamental point----------- why I was investigated was not explained.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that is this .</p>
<p class="null-p">"Similar to him …." I said. "I've heard that several times since earlier, but….that worst ----- guy, it's not clear at all, Kuchiha-chan, who is he ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan pointed at the gate. When I didn't get the meaning of that,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan asked, "Did you see that signboard over there?" And she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you can't not see it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah….to see it or not, well, I used it as a landmark. Umm, what was it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Saitou."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan lowered her finger and said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Saitou clinic...….Saitou is sensei's mentor….or something like that, he was this clinic's owner before it became a research institute….that would be it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……? That's a very vague manner of speaking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are similar to that person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">That, even if you say that I'm similar to a guy as vague as the worst , it's the same thing as saying that I resemble a demon killer, either way it's just adding insult to injury.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You look as if everything worked out as desired."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, as I said earlier….you're similar to how he was a long time ago. Before he became humanity's worst…. that's crucial ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the reason why sensei called you….eccentric, isn't it. I wonder if it will repeat again. That person, I truly wonder how many times she will repeat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….then, that sentiment…. Well, I'm used to projecting someone. I'm an empty guy, so speaking of being similar to me, I'm a guy who seems to be similar to everyone….that is a second-hand retelling of what a certain person said, I myself am not really self-aware of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm a guy who's made up of a mishmash of various faults.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess I was said to be that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sentiment----it isn't that lukewarm or simple of a concept. That person isn't such a human being….such a goal can only be secondary. That person's goal …. is being achieved now ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" For me to talk to you -----is that person's goal ." Kuchiha-chan said. "After all, didn't I say this was like a police lineup? Your brain is very well functioning and wise but….I wonder if you understand that meaning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Meaning."</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly, I have no idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">" By talking to you who is similar to him , measuring the impact on me….or, the information I'm hiding, getting asked about that by you -----is it easier to understand with such expressions? What do you think?" "What do I think….that he, with you….I mean, did you have a good relationship?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could put it like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The expression that Kuchiha-chan showed at this moment was exquisite and indescribable.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you were to force me to express it, a proud expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Similar to a boastful expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder why.</p>
<p class="null-p">That expression----- it doesn't fit the current Story .</p>
<p class="null-p">Doesn't fit into the current context.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the very least----he was a mentor for me as much as he was for sensei.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was taught various things that were useful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..If so, then it's jumping to a quick conclusion. I can't think that of a college teacher----if it worked just because we are similar, no one would have a hard time. It's like saying you can eat dumplings while watching a tortoise, that's all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I agree with that opinion. I agree rather than approve. Conversely speaking, it seems that I'm at a loss….sensei is a great researcher and scholar but, it can't go like with him ….well, it seems that sensei had planned such a strategy a long time ago, but there was a shortage of human resources-----well, even if it's before being the worst , it's rare to find people like that man. Besides, it's not necessarily just a bad idea….actually,</p>
<p class="null-p">I've already talked too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">So----</p>
<p class="null-p">So, what's that, that expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such an expression, such words from her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's completely mismatched.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's completely----zigzagged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….If so, should you not say that to me? If Assistant Professor Kigamine's idea is really like that, I….and also you, even for you, I think it would be better not to expose that idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you noticed it as the result of insight….me and him, even if we do look similar----I don't think I should be aware of that fact."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan readily nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, that is not a cause of o ense. I'm in sensei's care, but I have no obligation to her. Using his existence in such a manner, can't you say it is cowardly?" "…..Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end….</p>
<p class="null-p">She went to this courtyard to say that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, everything was just foreshadowing my arrival here.</p>
<p class="null-p">It fit expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">It moved according to the strategy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither treachery nor resistance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither criminal nor crime.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet----</p>
<p class="null-p">It doesn't go as calculated .</p>
<p class="null-p">If you say let's talk, then let's talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Do not leave the facts you know uprooted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..That is a very complicated relationship."</p>
<p class="null-p">You could say it's half love and half hate. In response to my words, Kuchiha-chan made a face like that of an accomplice. "Well, yeah", she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But don't get me wrong. I did not forget that I am in sensei's care. I said it earlier too, but I don't hate that person's personality. However, only you being able to dance as you wish doesn't please me at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you say it clearly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It irritates me if you progress things in places I don't know so I wanted to trouble you a little."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..like a child."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, Kuchiha-chan said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not alive so naturally I'm not going to grow. Mind, body, and spirit."</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">April.</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with Kunagisa for days on that lonely island floating in the Sea of Japan, Wet Crow's Feather island, there I met a fortune teller. It wasn't that lukewarm of a meeting, but anyway, I met her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fortune teller's name is Himena Maki.</p>
<p class="null-p">A pervert, a person that gets carried away easily, a heavy drinker, a person that laughs foolishly while hiding her true thoughts, a bad personality, a person that loves money and loves to sleep. Blond hair, ponytail.</p>
<p class="null-p">But such small features are trivial. It's only a vain distance from the truth. Ultimately, the word that expresses her, in other words the word that binds her, is unique.</p>
<p class="null-p">Supernatural power.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, an abnormal ability.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is surely no use in arguing about it, thoroughly and completely, destroying any and everything. Seeing through the past, saying everything about the present, listening to the future, and learning the hearts of people. ESP.</p>
<p class="null-p">That too, is the ultimate point that has reached the extreme.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's in other words----the ability to read the flow of fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps it was the ability to read the Story .</p>
<p class="null-p">'It's a useless ability' she herself said.</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, whether that was true or not, whether she possesses such superpowers is not something that I can decide. Perhaps it was all a lie and she might have been blu ng. At least, regarding as far as we can measure it, that kind of thing, there's no use in measuring it. What in the heck kind of means can be enough to be an observer to the observer?</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides----</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't want to talk about crucial matters.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kept her mouth closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Through talkativeness, she defended her silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">So.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so.</p>
<p class="null-p">If her superpower is authentic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring thousands of standards and piercing through thousands of paradoxes.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she had the ability to read the Story.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that's the case, was she outside?</p>
<p class="null-p">Not inside----</p>
<p class="null-p">Which possesses no role, only just there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having nothing to do with anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Could you say that was a lonely soul?</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're awfully spacing</p>
<p class="null-p">oo------------‐----------------------------------------ut.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oniisan."</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard a voice and looked up at the tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">No….not Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">That didn't have on that black manteau. Like a straightjacket with a design that made you want to look away, both arms were firmly restrained and bare.</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">The facial expression was totally di erent.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a smile full of malice.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is…..</p>
<p class="null-p">It was needless to think which of the two this is.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's…..Niounomiya Izumu! I'm the cute professional killer! Yes, yes, yes, yes, heelllloo! Yeah! Gyahahahahaha!" "….It's dangerous if you stand in such a place."</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be hard to say the branch on which Izumu-kun was sitting on was thick and elegant. Furthermore there's the fact that he can't use both arms. Also-----regardless of the mind, Rizumu-chan's body is thin. To say that one shouldn't worry would be unreasonable advice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's dangerous, huh…...gyahaha, is there anything more dangerous in this world than my head? At least here, there's nothing dangerous for me….haha, besides, isn't it a nice view? This place. The sky is my birthplace, or something like that? I say good things! Gyahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….The aptitude test?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm done. So, I'm just taking a break….my little sister was the one who took the exam. Well, didn't she more or less perform fairly well? It might be surprising, but…. she is a surprisingly smart person. Especially in science and mathematics. Gyahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He laughed out loudly without any reason. Personally, I don't want to see that kind of thing on Rizumu-chan's face….but, once you start thinking about either one's ownership of the body, there's no end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Onii-chan's companion….what was it? Yes, it's Yukariki</p>
<p class="null-p">Ichihime-----right. She is still doing the exam. She's an idiot. She might be dumber than me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But."</p>
<p class="null-p">The playful eyes rapidly contracted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Too suddenly, it was a metamorphosis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She has for sure killed way more people than me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to deceive….would be pointless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely confident eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Incidentally, the number that I've slaughtered at work has never surpassed three digits….because it's limited to one hour a day." Gyahaha, he laughs. "But that Yukariki is nothing like that….against her I'm just a decimal. An explosive user? If not you can't kill that many at this age. For reference….I am 18 years old and Rizumu is 16 years old. And this body is 22 years old. Her calling herself a graduate student isn't especially a complete lie….hey, onii-san. What the heck is Yukariki's age?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seventeen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? I see. I thought she was just a junior high student. I can't say I pleasantly agree to this….I came out unconsciously."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Unconsciously."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That. I'm automatic….well, not really! It's automatiiiiiiiiiiic! Gyahahaha, just joking?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun laughed as if to echo.</p>
<p class="null-p">Courtyard----</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan was no longer there.</p>
<p class="null-p">She only said what she wanted to say, in other words, when she had achieved her purpose, 'See you later' and escaped from my field of view. In reality, that wasn't really the case, but it felt like an escape to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like I let her slip.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought it was no good.</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation has completely washed away.</p>
<p class="null-p">It may be the usual thing--------but now, in such a situation, it is no good to be swept away as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's too dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">I need to do something….to reset and go back to neutral. No, that's wrong. I have to put the gear up top. As much as possible, construct the best barriers you can build to get over this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Calm down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow this development has become incomprehensible.</p>
<p class="null-p">What are your top priorities at the moment?</p>
<p class="null-p">Take it easy. Parry. Don't think about the meaning. Don't rush to preferences. Don't worry. Stop thinking. Throw away doubts. Don't ask questions. It's unrelated to me, right? Let's say it three times. Unrelated to me, unrelated to me, unrelated to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it weren't-------I have no interest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Okay.</p>
<p class="null-p">Breathing was in order.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could organize my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then I took one breath. Now, I can head back indoors…..having said that,</p>
<p class="null-p">I called out to Rizumu-chan(Izumu-kun) located above the tree. "Um-----Izumu-kun. Would you come down? It's hard to talk when I'm being looked down on from such a high place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it okay? I haven't killed anyone today, so I could eat you at worst.' Izumu-kun opened his mouth and exposed his teeth. "….Because it's such a body. If I don't do that, I can't look down on people. Oniisan isn't that tall either, that's a feeling you understand, isn't it?" "….By chance….did you hear that conversation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The conversation just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well. But don't worry. As I said before, my memory is almost never transmitted to Rizumu. However the inconvenient things------- here, it means the inconvenient things about my work , every inconvenience is entirely forgotten. Adjustment of memory….the recollection is altered, well, it's edited to some level."</p>
<p class="null-p">Things concerning Niounomiya Izumu.</p>
<p class="null-p">Things concerning the Niounomiya Massacre Group.</p>
<p class="null-p">Things concerning the professional killer, the slaughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything------automatically forgotten.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the absolute contradiction of Niounomiya searching for</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki ------she cannot notice.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, even with K asugai-san's action, the fact that money was stolen when she had collapsed might be simply because Izumu-kun has used it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Falsification----</p>
<p class="null-p">Editing----</p>
<p class="null-p">Reorganization.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, iiin-oootheeer-wooords, thaaaat's-it. From the small everyday level, to naturally the deep point, it's a perfect oversight! From big things to small things, aren't we Brothers, Yanmar? Gyahaha! What we do here , doesn't transmit to Rizumu. A memory disorder and fainting, that is the cause. Well, she's also a great detective, what we're talking about now, she could find out herself….um, what was it? Knocking ten times? 'A detective shouldn't see through the truth by coincidence', that thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And it's fine for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine for professional killers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I guess it's not bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, a professional killer itself is bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking in accordance with common sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Does it really make sense to follow common sense here?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, by the way, the 'knock ten times' earlier was a pun o of 'Knox's Ten</p>
<p class="null-p">Commandments'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't explain."</p>
<p class="null-p">I retorted the killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">You can't quite underestimate me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah….hey, you still haven't healed that wound on your cheek. I heard from</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu that you cut your hair but…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You told me that you don't hand down what you know to Rizumu-chan, but the opposite is transmitted. That's why the information is not interactive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The transmission from Rizumu to me is not 100 percent. I heard about the hair over the phone . To some extent it's divided from where it's pulled from, or else it will get dragged along ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..An artificial split personality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? What did you study? Um, is the information source Yukariki Ichihime?</p>
<p class="null-p">Wonderful, wonderful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a minute, that's not it."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">This guy's perception is as good as a great detective's.</p>
<p class="null-p">At any rate, the thing that I want to avoid the most is a conflict between Hime-chan and this non-Rizumu Man Eater . I don't think Hime-chan would be defeated but, that girl….it's just that I don't want her to participate in such things. In fact, I didn't want to bring her here. In the first place, even if not, Hime-chan still….hasn't cut ties. She hasn't cut ties with her old habits. Despite following Aikawa-san's words, I never thought the situation would be like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….the Niounomiyas are absurd. Giving birth to an existence like yourself isn't something you would think normally"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm, hm. Is it? We, I and Rizumu, seem to be a product, or a by-product, of</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya . It might be not bad to get to the point of that hateful Fragment ------oops, I talked too much. Or perhaps, did you also hear about Fragments from Yukariki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, no---."</p>
<p class="null-p">I grew confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, it's bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Touching upon Hime-chan is bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">It may be pushy but, anyway, let's divert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..About you appearing here….so that means Rizumu-chan's work is a sham isn't it."</p>
<p class="null-p">I asked Izumu-kun directly, but asking such a thing is pointless. It won't deviate the subject. Even if it's a joke to the professional killer . The Massacre Magic Group, a member of the Niounomiya's performing arts Group. The duty of confidentiality regarding a large number of confidential matters would be greater than that of a doctor, a lawyer, or even a great detective.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kigamine Yaku and Kuchiha Madoka."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was told that these two people should be disposed of."</p>
<p class="null-p">……….</p>
<p class="null-p">Loose-lipped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aperture!</p>
<p class="null-p">"….No, the aperture is di erent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, sorry…." Of course he won't get it. "More than that, by whom." "Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey. C'mon, oniichan. No matter how much you are Rizumu's benefactor, I can't reveal the name of a client."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this point you've already revealed the name of the target…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, as far as I can tell, it's Mister Fox. You met him yesterday, right? That unpleasant masked man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">If sometime later in my life I hate someone enough to want to kill them, I wouldn't ask this guy. I'd be immediately arrested for instigating murder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fox…."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan's client….was also him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rizumu-chan's job …..then it really is a sham." I became lifeless. A short while ago I saw at the parking lot, the admirable figure of Rizumu-chan, when I think that everything was based on a lie------even if you're not me, even if you're me, I guess you'll be trapped by lifelessness. "Then….the man with the fox mask, is naturally aware of you guys. Not as brother and sister, but as a person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have been something like raised by that guy recently…. it seems he isn't going to move openly. I don't know much but….it seems that Rizumu too doesn't know that much either but, well, it doesn't matter. So, we are that Mister Fox's limbs, his arms and legs or something. In that sense, the great detective Rizumu is full of useful information, right? I don't mean everything is fake. It seems like her journey to find the youngest child of the</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki didn't bear fruit….hmm. Zerozaki Hitoshiki. An unpleasant guy."</p>
<p class="null-p">He murmured, the latter mostly to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, as you said about this matter. When it comes to work, Man Eater is the main and Carnival is the sub…...naturally she carries out the intelligence gathering. First, Rizumu does the field work and, according to the results, Izumu does the killing field . That's the usual modus operandi for us . Oh, don't worry. I'm not saying we'll do something today just yet. Because you looked after Rizumu, like you asked of Rizumu, until the part-time job begins and ends, I'll wait, as long as it's no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope so."</p>
<p class="null-p">I sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, what the hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not related to me, not related to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I understand, you know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine Yaku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Madoka Kuchiha.</p>
<p class="null-p">The professional killer's targets.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan too, was asked the same thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Why did Mister Fox ask you and Rizumu-chan to do that? To kill those two people, even though….Rizumu-chan said that he seems to be interested in them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows. I don't know. I'm to kill them and that's it, I do it in a way that follows the client's intentions."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..You are the worst professional killer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The worst….hey, that's exactly what we were saying about Zerozaki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although….the etymology is di erent isn't it. Hmm? Wait a minute. The</p>
<p class="null-p">Saitou East Clinic….Oh? Oh, oh, oh….ooh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun tilted his head, becoming more and more sideways until, finally, he lay sideways on that branch that could by no means be called thick. It was very dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….ah, okay. That's what it is….Mister Fox's situation is like that ….oh, I didn't notice. No, I don't particularly care----it doesn't matter at all. I guess that person is also having a hard time…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm talking to myself. By the way, oniisan. Is one okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I have only received questions. I guess I was asked questions by you and I explained the obscure and hard to understand parts for the sake of introductions, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I guess so, but…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to ask one."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine….what is it." I was full of caution, but I put up a bold front and responded to Izumu-kun, who was lying down, with a question. "I can't hear out the wishes of a man without hearing its contents. Why would a murderer carry my palanquin?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahahahahaha! To say such a thing." After taking about no more than one move, I was laughed at. "Why should I work with someone lower than myself? Don't you know the equity theory?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Things are how they are, so I won't particularly refute that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My request is." Izumu-kun said. "After this, you and Rizumu….I mean, it's also me, but not me just Rizumu, can you make friends with each other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" She . Has no friends at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">He raised himself up from the branch and corrected his posture. Suddenly, he bent his back as it is, hooked his feet, and was now in an upside-down hanging position. By doing so, the position of both my and Izumu-kun's heads were almost at the same height.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's mostly my fault….but she has many eccentricities. I can't tell you about other people, but after all Rizumu is an artificial persona, so the eccentricities stand out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention she is a great detective …..but, you seem to be fine with it. It looks like you're able to successfully go along with Rizumu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I push myself quite a bit…." I responded to Izumu-kun with a feeling of regret. "Well, I'm used to being with weirdos….but in regards to the occupation of a professional killer, let's see, I have a friend who's a demon killer. So I really should be used to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's good for you…but."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun said while hanging upside down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fear of murder….if you're not on the side of being the killer or the killed, you can't understand its true meaning. If you're a bystander, even if you try to get accustomed to it, it will be swept out from under your feet. In that sense, you get the feeling that you're half-assed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is----thank you. For the info."</p>
<p class="null-p">The killing side.</p>
<p class="null-p">The killed side.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you've lived a life that has never been either….well, that'd be really nice.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is, however, unfortunately unfortunate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, how about you? Mister Fox seems to somewhat like you ... fortunately,"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like there is a connection."</p>
<p class="null-p">…...A connection?</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder what it is?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it fashionable? That phrase.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least, locally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Well, it doesn't really matter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know if I'm a friend, but….I think Rizumu-chan is an interesting girl to tease. If we can socialize more in the same way, then it's no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you so much. You'll make me shed tears."</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, there is one condition." Just as I said to Rizumu-chan a moment ago, I said to Izumu-kun. "Not only here , but from now onward , I don't want you to kill anyone in front of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What's that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't like it. People dying."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun stared at me blankly.</p>
<p class="null-p">This metaphor is in reverse, but it's like preaching at the Buddha.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, I continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like you to do it in a place that's unrelated to me….I don't like it when people are dying in a place connected to me….it makes me feel depressed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Feel depressed, hey…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun did not use his arms (obviously), and he rotated with just the power of his legs and stood in a well-balanced position on the branches. And then----he looked down on me and laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who do you think I am. The Massacre Magic Group, the 18th member of the Niounomiya Circus, the product of the thirteenth experiment? Regardless of if the target is unrelated or related, if the target resists or doesn't resist, if the target has connections or lacks relations, eating until there's nothing left, the professional killer of professional killers, Izumu the Man Eater . To stray from killing who he must kill means starvation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahaha." Izumu-kun laughed quietly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But….well, I can promise that much. First of all, I rarely come out except when I am at work….it doesn't seem like there'll be an opportunity to work in front of you in the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Why."</p>
<p class="null-p">I took a step forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just one more step, let's go deeper.</p>
<p class="null-p">Take the risk, and approach the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, why now ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now….why didn't you move forward before ? If your job is after Rizumu-chan's investigation is completed ….right now, it doesn't make sense for you to appear before me. You said you were worried about Hime-chan------just from that, I can't think of why it's necessary for you to take such a risk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As far as why you showed up now-- ----it means nothing for your work."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the contrary, it can be said to have the opposite e ect.</p>
<p class="null-p">If anyone were to see this place….if Assistant Professor Kigamine and</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan who are the targets were to see, it would be decisive.</p>
<p class="null-p">No reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or, does he have some plan?</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, what is it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Something worth the risk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something that can be traded for risk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….let's see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun doesn't even know the answer himself. It felt like he was talking to himself while thinking, speaking from the highest point while wishing for a higher sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Oniisan. Do you know what it means to be strong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Strong…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not the same thing as you talked about with Madoka but…. not dying is not the same thing as living , and strong does not mean not weak ----excessive strength inevitably involves weakness. …..I think you probably don't know since you're respectable, but for example in my world there's a being called Death Colored Crimson."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Death Colored Crimson ...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, it's a name I've never heard of.</p>
<p class="null-p">Does Hime-chan know about it?</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're so strong it become stupid to think about it--------but, regarding work , that person doesn't boast of a 100 percent success rate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, their achievement rate is somewhat low at the current stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably lower than mine. Do you know why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So….in other words, because you are 'strong', you are conversely cautious? That….before you accomplish your work, they escape or possibly surrender…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Extraordinary strength goes beyond being a threat and becomes just a risk. If your strength reaches an outrageous level and you're already a disaster of an existence…. before long things such as victory and defeat won't materialize for you. I'm not talking about equity theory but, in order to decide the outcome, winning or losing, you need to implement the game first. Winning and losing need to be fair----in other words, beings that are too dangerous cannot win ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I see." I nodded. " Speaking in terms of this world , we can hypothesize about nuclear weapons and such arms. Come to think of it, I've heard it before. If you're too strong …. you can't get serious . If you're too strong, there is no being that's the opposition. Because there is no opposition, you will not be able to balance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm? Ha, haha, balance. Well, there are also guys around who say such sensible things. Gyahaha! Amusing, amusing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">This guy laughs a lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan is the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't understand the feeling of a person who laughs without meaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no meaning to a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is when I go there….I'm just quite biased towards strength . I was created in such a way. To be honest, I haven't even seen Death Colored Crimson . But….yes, being too strong is the same as being too weak. The strongest and the weakest commute." Strong is weak, weak is strong----</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun made a pun on Shakespeare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not talking about lukewarm things like there being a paper-thin di erence between strength and weakness. Strength and weakness are two sides of the same coin. So, for this reason, you need to determine a precise sense of balance. Weakness means that a negative image precedes it----we are not wary of the weak….it's not regarded as dangerous. And, if you are aware of the weak part, you will be entirely careless of it. You can become insane . If you have nothing to protect, you don't have to defend. You can be greedy if you don't have anything. If you abandon everything, you do not despair. If you run last, you will not be shot from behind----you will be able to see everyone without being seen by anyone. Create a chink in the human heart. Strong is weak, weak is strong----while that may be true, just being weak is no good. A balance between strength and weakness is needed….like the yin and yang. Light and dark, positive and negative…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's….you, and Rizumu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. Man Eater and Carnival." Izumu-kun said really happily. "In short, this me….well, this body , possesses strength and weakness separately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu is entirely in charge of my weakness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Split personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">Artificial dissociative identity disorder.</p>
<p class="null-p">Artificial personality----</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't it just Rizumu-chan?</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not one plus one is two.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's one divided by two is two halves.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well this is just one of the experimental trials of the The Massacre Magic Group, the Niounomiya Circus….to catch the byproducts? It's too much trial and error for one to understand, I don't know if I'm a success, but at least this me towers above the rest in strength -------to the extent where I can't control myself if I don't wear these clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally….</p>
<p class="null-p">I understood the reason for that straightjacket.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there is no sense of accomplishment. Here….at this point, at this point, such a thing, such an extremely trivial thing, was no longer a good stage anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I am now….I'll even surpass 'Death Color Crimson' so, one way or another, I want some chance to compete with Death Color Crimson , but to borrow Mister Fox's word's, finding such a fate between Death Color Crimson and me seems to be so di cult as to be impossible----but, setting that aside" Izumu-kun said. "I'm not inhuman enough to think nothing about Rizumu-chan who is in charge of my weakness …….at any rate, she's basically my younger sister and, before that, myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Younger sister----and, myself, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's rare to see her as continuously lively as when she was with you, that Kasugai or that young girl. All I see is that she is always rejected, hurt, and above all, she forgets it all in a flash, that poor figure of Rizumu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Forgetting…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rizumu, who is in charge of my 'weakness', forgets even her own wounds. If you get hurt, and the wound remains, and you stop coming into contact with others, then you can't serve your role as a Carnival ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Role----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Altering memory. Editing memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">All inconvenient things are forgotten.</p>
<p class="null-p">In oneself, it fits coherently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Your world is closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how much she is hurt, no blood will flow from those wounds, it's laughable, laughable. Weak, weak, too weak."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Yeah" It is----</p>
<p class="null-p">Too weak.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know such a poor weakness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Specialized in weakness, Cannibal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a poor weakness----</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know other than myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mister Fox's handling of Rizumu is still preferable, however Mister Fox isn't the type to make friends with ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm….but, if it's Rizumu-chan----truly, truly truly truly, even if it's not me, I feel like she can make friends with anyone. Well, there may be many eccentricities, but if you accept them…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure, she's skilled at socializing. That carefree idiot can completely ignore all the twists and troubles of human relationships, even without rewriting her memories. She can make a forced smile amiable. That is also the privilege of weakness …for the benefit of the field work, it's the privilege of weakness. But, however" Izumu-kun corrected his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, that's temporary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Temporary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's hollow. If I come out, it's over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">Professional killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Massacre Magic Group.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Niounomiya Circus.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, basically, that's it."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what kind of character Rizumu-chan is----</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no changing that she is a Cannibal.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the transience shuts there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything turns hollow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Knowing everything, without hurting Rizumu-chan, the possibility of a being capable of staying at her side----exactly, how likely is it, is it possible?</p>
<p class="null-p">Knowing everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet not changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">What if there is a person who can stay the same?</p>
<p class="null-p">"So----I'm the one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm good. I'm a professional killer, I don't need friends. I don't curry favors with anyone, and I don't bend to anyone. I live relying on my own superpower. That's fine….but, she's not on this side, right? Still, to be treated like me, don't you think that's a bit lonely?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….it would be."</p>
<p class="null-p">That is the reason why he came out now .</p>
<p class="null-p">The meaning for why he appeared before me.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he missed this opportunity , surely me and Izumu-kun would not meet. If Izumu-kun is aware of Hime-chan, then I can't a ord to talk in the building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rizumu is, for me, a puppet , a shadow , a place to hide , or a remote-controlled autonomous RC----before that, she's also my younger sister . Only, what can I do for her? For me she is helplessly my younger sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fundamental."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gyahaha, Izumu-kun laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your condition, I'll accept it…. I'll make a contract with you. In front of you, let's ban all killing except for self protection. That one hour of slaughter will be when you're absent instead"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. Even if, as I said, I don't particularly plan on changing how I deal with Rizumu-chan….so far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's fine. What I'm expecting from you is that you don't change too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do not change----right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, oniichan, erotic things are also prohibited, yea? Yea! Hugh!!" Gyahaha, Izumu-kun laughed. "Yo, yo, yo! If I feel pain above the threshold, if I feel a sense of crisis, I'll for sure come out automatically."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..That worry is useless."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahaha! Hey. Then, onii-chan, on that note, the contract has been signed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah….then I'll gradually go back to the building, what about you?" "Hmm….that's right. Yea, yea….let's get back with a time delay. I guess it'll be suspicious if we return together. I'll withdraw ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ok. That might be good. Hmm….I might never meet you again…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I hesitated a little, and felt a little bashful but, for now, I decided to say that. "If we have a connection, let's meet again."</p>
<p class="null-p">3</p>
<p class="null-p">One of the works of G rimms' Fairy Tales is titled "Brother and Sister." As a fairytale, it has a standard and orthodox structure, a long time ago there was an older brother and sister, naturally their mother is dead, and naturally they are abused by the stepmother, and after being unable to endure the severe abuse, they run away and conceal themselves in a sea of trees. But the malicious stepmother magically creates a spring in the sea of trees, and the older brother who drinks from the spring turns into a dumb deer----</p>
<p class="null-p">And, of course, the ending is a happy ending.</p>
<p class="null-p">The brother and sister live happily together.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, it's possible to say that having heard this story, no one would not associate it with Franz Kafka's "Metamorphosis". What kind of ending comes out of that story, and what kind of brother and sister come out of it, I honestly can't recall. And comparing these two stories, I can't think of which one is more realistic.</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, I'm not in a fictional story, I actually had a younger sister, but that doesn't mean there was any story. Before I could do anything towards my younger sister, just one act worthy of an older brother, she had lost her life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A younger sister….certainly, that's an exceptional thing to have." Parting with Izumu-kun, I went around the building to return to the room I was in, but when I turned to the parking lot, I stopped my legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm, come to think of it, I wanted to take a closer look if I had the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Fiat….apart from that which I had frequently looked over.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Katana and the Z.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not know much about di erent types of motorcycles, but still I knew of the Katana. A 750cc motorcycle….aside from her young body's arms, it's di cult to tell if Rizumu-chan could reach with her legs. But, to really do something like this in a straightjacket….</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess it can always be taken o .</p>
<p class="null-p">If I think about such a thing normally, I guess she could always have decided to wear the straightjacket after coming here. Assistant Professor Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan, there are people here who can help that much. No but, even if it's fine this time, what does she normally do? I don't think there is such a kind person everywhere….in the first place, setting aside getting the reason for the straightjacket from Izumu-kun, it's too mysterious that Rizumu-chan is dressed like that without any doubts . The mystery just keeps on deepening. That too, I guess it's also a reorganization of her memory. Her personality is made so that she doesn't have any doubts about her strange appearance, is that what that means?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, the purple Z.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm a commoner, so if asked between the two I'd prefer the Fiat, but I'm not so tasteless as to feel nothing about the coolness and stylishness of a sports car. Mister Fox's Porsche and Jun-san's Cobra, I think they're good. …..Well, the Z and the Porsche, even the Katana, I can't a ord right now even if I do a headstand. It's fine, I like the Vespa. I got it from Mikoko-chan. I love you,</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikoko-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the sky, it seemed to be getting darker as expected. That's how it looks here among the mountains, but I guess it's already considerably severe in the mountains. But on the paved road….</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm worried about Kasugai-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's usually dauntless but, Kasugai-san, I don't think she's particularly fit. She might run into a stray dog or something….oh, that person is fine with animals. But, physical strength is still a problem. Just like Rizumu-chan, if you're collapsed in a mountain, no one will help.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..Really, she's a troublesome person.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's quickly catch up to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing the small appreciation party, I opened the door and took o my shoes before going inside. I had already completely memorized the return route through the hallway and opened the sliding door,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! It's Onii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was only Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">She went on ahead while I was looking at the cars….while the Man Eater , I guess he went back somewhere behind the window. If I just believe in Izumu-kun's words, Rizumu-chan's perception and Rizumu-chan's memory will be something like 'I've been alone in this room since I finished the aptitude test' I guess it'd be like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reorganization, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did you go? I was lonely!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….I looked at the car in front of the parking lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh….. Oniisan, do you like cars?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unlike humans….machines are easy to understand and do not betray….that's what a friend of a friend said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A car is not a machine. It is a living thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan said sharply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I count on you on that point."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems better to avoid discussion.</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation could become considerably poor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did you do on the exam?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perfect!" Rizumu-chan did a victory sign. "Probably the perfect score, ten thousand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's good."</p>
<p class="null-p">While talking half mindedly, I wondered where Kuchiha-chan had gone. I guess she has her own room somewhere….if you think about it, I still only know the way from the entrance to this room. There may be a laboratory or a preparation room somewhere….</p>
<p class="null-p">But, well, what.</p>
<p class="null-p">This has become somewhat complicated and troublesome.</p>
<p class="null-p">……….</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder if I can cancel right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard footsteps from the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of two people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----I don't know about leaving the sliding door open."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Assistant Professor Kigamine and Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine was as usual,</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan was exhausted.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, her eyes were dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The exam has been successfully completed." Assistant Professor Kigamine said. "So, Yukimura-san and….Yukariki-san both passed…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was cool as usual, her face twitched a little at 'Yukariki-san' like a feeling of denial, I felt a little reluctance.</p>
<p class="null-p">……….</p>
<p class="null-p">If Kasugai-san was here, Hime-chan would have failed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although now, for me, this selection of people was di cult.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do your best from next week onward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes," I answered. "Hime-chan too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">No reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like a corpse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! I will do my best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan was full of spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she is a spy.</p>
<p class="null-p">And a professional killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well----then, what kind of plans do you have after this? If you have the time, we can eat together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, no." I refused Assistant Professor Kigamine's invitation. "We need to catch up with Kasugai-san quickly. Even if it's her, it is dangerous for a woman to walk by oneself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh….that's right." Assistant Professor Kigamine nodded. "Then, at least we'll see you o . ….Huh? Where did Kuchiha go? I should have told her to deal with you here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know. Oniisan, do you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">How should I explain?</p>
<p class="null-p">I could speak honestly but….rather, it seems like Kuchiha-chan herself wants it….well, me too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if I try to do it, I'll be moving just as Kuchiha-chan calculated, it's annoying. There is no such courtesy or reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried to seduce her and she ran away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't be convinced!</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah….Rizumu-chan is looking down on me!</p>
<p class="null-p">"I predicted beforehand that you would fail to seduce Kuchiha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's useless to make excuses.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's important for humans to give up.</p>
<p class="null-p">I picked up Hime-chan who was sticking to the tatami mat like ice cream and carried her on my back. Hime-chan's body is very light. Now that the soul is missing, it's even lighter. ….Is it there a weight to the soul?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, excuse me. I was intruding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ri….Yukimura-san, what will you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I asked Rizumu-chan and,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I'll talk a little more here."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems she was going at her own pace.</p>
<p class="null-p">Great Detective . Professional killer .</p>
<p class="null-p">Well….I'm not involved.</p>
<p class="null-p">It has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">You don't have to worry about Assistant Professor Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan, nor do you even need to think about why the man with the fox mask is using Rizumu-chan and Izumu-kun, no need to think.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is none.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is absent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'll see you next week, Yukimura-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Goodbye for a short while." Rizumu-chan smiled broadly. "Well then, goodbye!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will try my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">And now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Exactly as stated, we parted for a short while.</p>
<p class="null-p">About five minutes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The parking lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fiat, Katana, Z.</p>
<p class="null-p">A total of ten tires had been destroyed.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/zaregoto/illustrations/zaregoto_vol_06_12.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">0</p>
<p class="null-p">The loser dies in despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The winner dies in yearning.</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh! Then master, you mean you did not cry even when you read 'The Cat</p>
<p class="null-p">Who Lived a Million Times'!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are a demon!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan pointed her finger at me. It was an extremely menacing look that I truly thought the finger would stab my eyeball.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was so nervous that I broke down crying after reading that masterpiece!</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan broke down while reading at the bookstore and cried a lot!" "Buy it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, then, 'Air on the G String'!? Oh, if you heard that, even master would cry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um….what kind of song is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……...(speechless)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I remembered."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you remember!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's such a sluggish song."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kee!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A punch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ba, ba, apologize to Bach sensei! Prostrate yourself before Wilhelmina sensei!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I su ered a barrage of blows.</p>
<p class="null-p">It hurt quite a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But come on….isn't it hard to be impressed if you have a high reputation or a famous work that is famous for being top notch? I mean, I'll be on guard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu. It's not like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan refused with her whole body so as to deny my words. I wonder if</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san's love of clichés has infected Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, then, then, master, when do you cry?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..When I use eye drops."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those are not tears!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan was truly angry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U, u, ugu, fueen !!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, she was genuinely crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, movies!? Master, what kind of movies have you seen!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….a mini theatre. But basically I don't go to movie theatres…..I'm not a fan of major works. Come to think of it, I recently watched "Tale of Tales" in Houko-chan's room." (TL : the 1979 one)</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey! Don't be pretentious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her personality is di erent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is that her true nature?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot! Master, be moved by the climax scene of "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind" with the swarm of insects or something!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master doesn't make any sense now."</p>
<p class="null-p">I lay down on the futon. Geez….what is this, what is this fate that I have to have a conversation like I'm on a school trip. While looking at the ceiling, "At any rate," I set the coordinates of the topic to a more reasonable location.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seems like….things have become weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said so.</p>
<p class="null-p">How or rather, since when has it been this extremely odd. Even when it was not odd, 'things have become odd' is I guess about what I would say but, in this case, not as a strong feeling or a metaphor, but as an objective expression, things have become odd.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't divert the conversation! Even Hagiwara-san says that people who are not interested in artistic and cultural activities are worthless----" "No, this is not a scene where you're going to forcibly continue the conversation in the introductory part." Read the mood, the mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hime-chan, think about it, you have supplementary lessons tomorrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">You won't be on time while we wait for repairs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever!" Hime-chan boomed! And hit both hands in front of her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was all beyond being completely forgotten!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You…."</p>
<p class="null-p">So your core didn't become better.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, now. Master, tomorrow's wind will blow tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not bad to say such an unusually accurate fixed sentence at this point, but today's wind can only blow today." It was past 9:00 at night on August 15th.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the second floor, in the clinic, Hime-chan and I were in a room that I guess would have been used as a hospital room. Hime-chan is on the provided bed, and I am on a futon laid on the floor. There is another hospital room next door where Rizumu-chan should be. Assistant Professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan have their own rooms on the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, we were staying overnight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not because it's said cutely that it changes anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, if you want to say it not cutely, then it's a cottage in a storm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder what I should say to Miiko-san…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, a car puncture isn't fixed like a bicycle puncture. To repair it----the location of this institute was too rural. Naturally, the gas station closed early and the repairman was on a summer vacation. Even when I tried to fix it myself, the spare tire was thoroughly damaged. In the first place, even if that's not the case, you don't have ten spare tires.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is a middle school in the neighborhood (that said, thirty minutes on foot is too much leeway) and Assistant Professor Kigamine's opinion is that it is a prank by the students. My opinion was that I wondered if there was a middle school student who would do such harassment with such care. Three people didn't have an opinion (Rizumu-chan, Hime-chan, Kuchiha-chan). However, after taking such an unproductive majority vote, we had no options. Returning home from here by taxi would cost such an amount that you would die. Taking a train or a bus was impossible. There is one bicycle, but it could not go over the mountain. It was still better to walk, but from this point the entire journey would be during the night. We didn't have the guts like Kasugai-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine originally planned to stay here starting from today to prepare for next week, and Kuchiha-chan originally lived here. However, Hime-chan, Rizumu-chan, and I were in a position where we couldn't say originally ----</p>
<p class="null-p">So we depended upon Assistant Professor Kigamine's kindness.</p>
<p class="null-p">…..That was the gist of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">We had dinner made by Kuchiha-chan (the flavor was all right) and took turns showering. It seems the place was furnished with a bath. The order was Hime-chan → Rizumu-chan → Kuchiha-chan → Assistant Professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine → and then me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan already finished showering and she borrowed a long T-shirt from Kuchiha-chan. Right now the one taking a shower….timewise it is probably Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is the current state of a airs.</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation has become odd.</p>
<p class="null-p">In any case, this is a situation where I was taking advantage of another's kindness.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is certain.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I wonder what it is, this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow….it's odd .</p>
<p class="null-p">Odd.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….What did you think? Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow….this is a contrived development. It's as if someone doesn't want us to leave here, it's a feeling like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it? Even so, surprisingly it may be exactly like what Assistant Professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine said. These days middle school students don't know what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Hime-chan was a middle school student----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry but your story about your time in middle school won't be helpful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're awful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I became irritated and retorted back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, this is exactly why the thief is shameless. Two months ago, with you and your high school members (and Aikawa-san) I don't intend to ever forget what we encountered there for my whole life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….In the first place, in addition to that, without having master bring</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan home, who would do it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are not necessarily the target. We only, just as usual, might have gotten mixed up in the situation…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe Assistant Professor Kigamine, or Kuchiha-chan…." Or, the pair of Cannibal----"Maybe Yukimura Touko-san. Besides, thinking about the mechanics, this crime was committed by an insider."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's how it is, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">At least, everyone had the opportunity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not everyone was monitoring everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">There isn't always someone together with someone. Hime-chan and Rizumu-chan who were taking the exam, and Assistant Professor Kigamine who was supervising them seemingly did not have any spare time, but they probably could have gone alone to the bathroom. In addition, Rizumu-chan finished the exam earlier than usual and Izumu-kun came out . Needless to say, Kuchiha-chan and I have been free the entire time. So, Izumu-kun,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan, and I had a stronger opportunity than Rizumu-chan,</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan, and Assistant Professor Kigamine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, what is it for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. When asked that…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yukariki Ichihime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine Yaku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Madoka Kuchiha.</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Rizumu.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or, Niounomiya Izumu.</p>
<p class="null-p">These six….whoever you take, each has their own goal. Rizumu-chan's goal is actually just a means for Izumu-kun's goal but, even so, in the first place they are the same person, because the relationship is an equals sign, you don't have to worry about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's going on.</p>
<p class="null-p">This phenomenon----it's seemingly pointless .</p>
<p class="null-p">It is incompatible with anyone's goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">The law of cause and e ect is not at all established.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow…. it's out of alignment or rather , it feels like it's disconnected from the important spot . What's with this feeling of wonder."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master likes to be worried. It feels like you're a worry enthusiast. Isn't that normal, that master is dragged into unreasonable trouble, isn't that completely normal? You can't help but worry about such a basic thing." "If you settle everything, then you won't move forward….I can't be so optimistic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm very suspicious. Master, are you okay? I have said this before. To trust a person is to profit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is a way of remembering kanji."</p>
<p class="null-p">Good grief, I stretched my body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh. Oh, yeah, I need to contact Kasugai-san….I wonder, does that person have a cell phone…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she has, I don't know the number. Then, let's contact</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san….that person doesn't have a cell phone, but she'll be home at this time----"</p>
<p class="null-p">I see….that's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, let's resolve ourselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this situation, it can't be helped.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a bit tense to be under the same roof as a professional killer in this situation, but Izumu-kun won't appear on the front anymore. When we first met, he said something like he had to use extraordinary energy to get to the front . I don't know if that's the truth or a lie, but still, if you have to constantly balance your mind, then I guess in the end your body will become out of balance. Rizumu-chan's fainting habit , and Izumu-kun's 'one hour per day'.</p>
<p class="null-p">You get what you pay for.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also called the pros and cons.</p>
<p class="null-p">However….the problem isn't just with Izumu-kun (and Rizumu-chan). Even Kuchiha-chan (and Assistant Professor Kigamine) too, I don't know how to describe it, but it was a problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Um. Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to borrow the knowledge of Shiogi-chan the dictionary " I raised my reclining body and faced Hime-chan with a serious tone. "First. Is it possible to create an immortal person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….okay. However, Hagihara-san had few opportunities to talk seriously about immortality….she said things like immortality is a romanticism that will never come true, or that it's opportunism as an escape from reality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't really understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiogi-chan is unexpectedly a poet?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Hagihara-san continued after that saying 'As a theoretical methodology, it's not an improbable story'. So, then this is not a serious story, please think of it as a story told on a night during a school trip, after you turned o the lights and got into the futon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….So there was a school trip. Even though you were in di erent school years…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be precise, it was a training camp. Well, in short, immortality in the material sense is the metabolism after all. The regenerative ability accompanying it. Furthermore, the immune system has an ability to adapt towards the surrounding environment which changes with each passing moment. If these are perfect, humans basically do not age. Or rather, they can keep their health . You won't die since you don't grow old. In other words, you are immortal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, the scene is like in a science fiction novel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cell copy integrity….genetic perfection.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you're invulnerable, then you're also immortal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, what about brain cells? When brain cells reach a certain amount, they stop increasing and have no regenerative ability….I've heard something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you retort such idle gossip it's a bit troublesome….well, it's like a floppy disk, if you forget everything except important information, and if you do not remember anything other than important information, then isn't it fine to a certain extent?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To record….no, To not remember . But….then, that doesn't make much sense for immortality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is a reverse methodology. If you are going to die, just record your personality in some organic media and move it to another new, healthy body….and. You could say it's a brain transplant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only Dr. Black Jack can do it, that kind of surgery….well, in that case if you were made into a half-cyborg, immortality would be possible. Program your personality onto something like a DVD disc and put it in the body of a</p>
<p class="null-p">machine………………………………………………………………………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's gotten stupid to even say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of topic is this?</p>
<p class="null-p">If that was possible, there'd be no hardship.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it's utter pseudoscience.</p>
<p class="null-p">Disregarding reality and practicality.</p>
<p class="null-p">Theory does not go hand in hand with practicality.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like….ESP.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like fatalism.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like magic isn't it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, the solution to get as close as possible to immortality is that the metabolic ability is active and the cell's regenerative ability surpasses that of most people , I guess it'll be a natural thing----as I said earlier, the theory that you can replace the unusable parts is basically a virtualization of that nature, but in the end such a thing would cost an astronomical amount of money." Hmm, I took a breath. " "I guess Immortality like that of a vampire is impossible….with such a realistic immortality surviving a shot to the back of the head is unreasonable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Hime-chan isn't really interested but." Hime-chan said as a preface.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How does Assistant Professor Kigamine approach that area?" "So far I don't know…..with only what was explained. And----really, it doesn't seem likely that she intends to inform us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That judgement is certainly correct……….well, I'll tell Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan. I heard that she has an undying body ".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?" As normal, Hime-chan responded in the same way that I did when I heard it. "What kind of metaphor is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows----that's what the person in question said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The person in question?….That sounds like a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well….whether it's a lie or the truth, it sounds like a lie anyway. Not trusting self-referencing remarks, no matter who you are with, is one of the most basic of basics. It's nonsensical to discuss….At this point, it feels like</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san's decision is becoming the best one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it? Even so, Hime-chan is having fun" Hime-chan was laughing. "Going out and staying with master somehow makes the inside of your chest get excited doesn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh….come to think of it, I've never had a trip where I stayed with</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it such a carefree thing?</p>
<p class="null-p">Making a face like she has no worries.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, sometime, let's go on a trip. Rather than such a strange place, let's stay at a hot spring resort."</p>
<p class="null-p">I set aside the topic of Kuchiha-chan and decided to go with Hime-chan's topic. Even if it's useless to consider, trying to force the worries you're harboring on another person for the sake of halving them is, after all, nothing more than a joint illusion based on ego. After all, it didn't seem like Izumu-kun was worried about Kuchiha-chan at all. First of all, what is the most necessary thing for humans? At the very least, it's the ability to leave aside the things you don't know without trying to know them. In short, that's how it is.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan, where do you want to go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? That's no good. Master, you have a girlfriend, right? If that's the case, then no matter how much Hime-chan wants it, you shouldn't do that. If that is the case then naturally sleeping in the same room as Hime-chan is no good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? I have no girlfriend….you're not talking about Kasugai-san, right? If that's the case, I will crush your mind with my refutations."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it. Geez, you can't hide it. Hime-chan heard it from</p>
<p class="null-p">Mii-nee-san. That master has a blue haired lover."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Eh, no way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san, did you look at me with such a perception?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on….that's a misunderstanding." I approached Hime-chan on a spinal reflex. "What….what did you hear? Did Miiko-san say that?" "Yes….what's with that serious face that I've never seen before. It looks like the face of a demon who received a hit from a peashooter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means the attack was too e ective…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't put power into my voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, what is this?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to be seen like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, Kasugai-san also said that it was hopeless or something like that….in that case did she know about that cold hearted thing? Did she know and laugh?</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Is it a misunderstanding?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right….she's just a friend. Did I not tell you sometime? She's a little similar to Hime-chan….ah….uwa----"</p>
<p class="null-p">I wavered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like all of my blood suddenly flowed into the heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">A scrambled egg.</p>
<p class="null-p">What surprised me was how surprised I was at the unexpected feeling of depression. It's been a long time since I was shocked at being misunderstood by another person. Uwa, the undying body or the Cannibal or the punctured tires, what had been monopolizing the priority of my thinking, became irrelevant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Master became depressed at mach speed…." Hime-chan drew attention to my poor state. "….What was misunderstood by Mii-nee-san, is it no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master, do you like Mii-nee-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm in trouble when asked up front.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I don't hate her. Right now, it is because of that person's help that I can live honestly in Japan. I forcibly dropped out halfway through the ER3 system and returned to this country, and if I hadn't met Miiko-san and Suzunashi-san in Kyoto----I would have only been able to survive by being taken in by the Kunagisa Syndicate.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, about whether I like or dislike another person.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a topic so laughable that I can't laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's just nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miiko-san is….to Miiko-san, I owe a debt of gratitude. She's a good person.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, she's one of the few people with common sense around me." "But, Mii-oneesan occasionally walks with a sword. A serious sword that is not a fake. I can't say she is a person with common sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…..that's right. I guess so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're i y." Hime-chan said with a manner that would make my tea muddy, she said it with a kind of pout. "You're indecisive. If you like it, then shouldn't you say it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">So young.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although I don't think it's enviable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although I think it's miserable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"People's feelings can become anything….like or dislike or love or hate, I love you or I hate you, if it's normal or not, I don't think that's the question. It's already out of the question. What are people's feelings but the accumulation and passing and misunderstandings?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..You should just continue being cynical and act like a nihilist, master." As if looking down on me, Hime-chan said so with a sigh. Somehow, it looked like a composed expression. "Master undoubtedly likes</p>
<p class="null-p">Mii-oneesan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time it was not a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">The answer is, for a moment, blocked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after a moment it remained jammed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not because….it was too abrupt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or because what she said was o the mark.</p>
<p class="null-p">…...If that's the case, then what is it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why can't I answer?</p>
<p class="null-p">It's right, but. It's wrong, but.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way it's fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's fine as long as I answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What….are you saying?" I finally answered Hime-chan. I should not be….shaking. "You've been saying ridiculous things since a moment ago. Calm down and think about it, it's not like that. Hey, who do you think I am."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Surprisingly, it's something you don't know yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Facing me, Hime-chan still looked composed. Composed, but also a little cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's something you won't notice unless you tell others. I don't know who I like. Even Hime-chan, until Nanami-san told me of the feelings I held----I didn't notice them at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"These----feelings?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Feelings that I'm in love with someone." Hime-chan laughed and answered quietly. "Yes. Nanami-san told me to hate him immediately. But that's not logical. You can't like people because of reason, and once you like them you can't easily hate them. I think that is really the same as what master said….whatever a person's feelings are----they'll only become like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….soo, then there's a person Hime-chan likes."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's a little surprising. Although there was no particular basis for it, I somehow thought Hime-chan was a girl that was disconnected from such things. Even if I put aside the past, I thought that her personality made her a girl that was unsuited for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There is."</p>
<p class="null-p">With plenty of confidence and a little joy, Hime-chan nodded. When I heard that, it didn't feel too bad. She may have an eccentric side, but Hime-chan also has a cute side.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. Then I guess you're also on very good terms with that person." I deliberately said in order to tease. "Since Hime-chan is in love with him, then he's surely cool, smart, manly, kind, and considerate, I guess it's like a man with no faults."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No." Hime-chan slowly shook her head. "He's uncool, stupid, e eminate person who's not at all kind and has no fragment of consideration, like a person who can't be beaten."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even then, he treasures Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person, I guess he would look at Hime-chan like at a stone on the roadside."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….How is such a person good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the perspective of a member of the same gender, my honest opinion would be to say that it seems like one step away from being the lowest. Even though I generally see the lowest of humanity, I've never heard of such a cruel person. It's annoying to agree with her, but I understand</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanananami's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't understand people.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't understand a woman's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even more so that of a young girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that of a bishoujo is impossible to understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person is so dull that surely he won't notice that Hime-chan likes him his entire life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will you not confess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can see the result. Hime-chan will never think of telling her feelings her entire life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your entire life?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My entire life. Absolutely, no matter what, I won't waver. I don't want to break my current barely existing relationship with that person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….that's kind of painful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It's painful." Hime-chan nodded. "But, it's strange and comfortable, that poor, painful feeling. In the old days, I didn't even think about this…." The old days.</p>
<p class="null-p">The present.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now----it's di erent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan, I guess she's changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Step by step, step by step, slowly and steadily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm not jealous.</p>
<p class="null-p">I only have high hopes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, I want Hime-chan to achieve it.</p>
<p class="null-p">What I couldn't do.</p>
<p class="null-p">What I can't do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm." And, Hime-chan tilted her head. "Somehow, I talked a little too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master, you're sensitive like that. For doing and being done, it seems like you hate interference. So, were you charmed by Mii-nee-san's excellent way of talking at a distance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….if you say it like that, maybe." The context is di erent, but it was the same feeling like when I was together with Tomoe-chan some time ago. "Anyway, Miiko-san is a person who's skilled at keeping a good distance. I guess because she does kendo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that's irrelevant."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyushu is good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Kyushu. The travel destination. Yeah. Master, if you really don't have a girlfriend, then it's ethically fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh….yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Did the conversation return that far?</p>
<p class="null-p">Because it was so abrupt, I was bewildered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Kyushu is big. Where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hakata. Um….Yuma-san's hometown."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Zigzag.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shisei Yuma.</p>
<p class="null-p">My words became stuck for a moment, but,</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..I understand. Let's go once I get the earnings from this part time job."</p>
<p class="null-p">And, normally, very normally, I nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the extent that it was not unnatural, I should have nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan said.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least, it looked like a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at that smiling face, and did not smile back.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know how to laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">By now, I can't remember.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, the two of us were now staring at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being awkward with Hime-chan…...</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, such a thing was rare----</p>
<p class="null-p">When.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ikki."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a knock on the opposite side of the room's door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon after the door opened and the figure that appeared from the other side was Kuchiha-san. Strangely wearing cat-like pajamas (are retorts banned?).</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed her hair gave the impression like she just finished taking a bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan spoke over the threshold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The shower is empty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh….what about Assistant Professor Kigamine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She already finished. Since she's a night person….I wonder if she'll work after this. At any rate, really I wonder if that person mistook me for a maid….she wanted me to do the shower report myself. Anyway, the shower.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's your turn. Or, are you the sort of man that is fine for a day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no….not particularly----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, it's di cult.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the conversation in the courtyard, we met face to face at dinner, but this was the first time we had a normal conversation. I'm grateful to her for breaking down the uncomfortable air with Hime-chan at the right time, but</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't say I have an amicable relationship with Kuchiha-chan. "……...?" Trying to understand Kuchiha-chan is pointless, but her expression was strange. "Well then….since you're last, you can use it as long as you want. The room is on the first floor…..do you understand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, but I do n't have any change of clothes for a man….it looks the same size so I guess it'll fit, but still it's a bit hard for me to lend my shirt, though, you seem shameless so you can sleep as you are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">But don't just casually say that I'm shameless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for the trouble, Kuchiha-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no. Well then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Waving her hand lightly, Kuchiha-chan closed the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow…..</p>
<p class="null-p">Her behavior was like the conversation in the courtyard never happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's relieving, it relieving but….all in all, I don't get this girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned towards Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan was looking at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit of that uncomfort returned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Well, I'll go wash away my sweat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Can I sleep first?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. By all means, don't hesitate."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan replied awkwardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it appeared as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it looked like the usual smile, it wasn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">Very awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed fleeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes looked terribly lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want that expression to stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">You are di erent from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not too late, you should be able to do your best.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, you had problems around you….unlike me, you've not been su ering from a problem that was fundamentally your own.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to say something to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really----</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, only for this girl----</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to do something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Hey, Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really like Hime-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you might not think it's persuasive because of my usual habit of saying nasty things, but it's a serious topic. To be honest, there are some things I'm not good at with Hime-chan, but even without Aikawa-san in between, Hime-chan is full of strong points. Until now, how many times have you helped me, even with this incident. You've followed me up to this point. Even a defective product like me thinks that, so surely that certain someone that Hime-chan likes will understand Hime-chan's feelings one day. So don't say things like you'll give up before you do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan looked down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes were no longer lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somewhere, her eyes were sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan too….I also like master. I really, really, like master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Well then, good night."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan got into the futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">I left into the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">After dinner, sin ce I had a part-time job next week, Assistant Professor Kigamine quickly showed me around the building, partly because it was renovated from a clinic, it was a technical research facility, though definitely di erent from last month's Shadou Kyouichirou's Research Facility, there were at the very least such things as chemicals and equipment, and it felt more like an archive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Conference room, briefing room. Library. WA room. Measurement machine room. Laboratory. Experiment preparation room. Waiting room (first room that I was guided to). Professor's room, Assistant Professor's room, assistant's room, seminar room (this area was only that in name, it's state was mostly of a storage room). There was a kitchenette, a bathroom, a changing room next to it, and a shower room in the back. And there seemed to be Kuchiha-Chan's room at the end of the first floor (I was not guided there. Of course). The second floor seemed to be a space for guests like us (formerly two hospital rooms). At this point, I wasn't shown the inside of each room in detail, so I can't say much about them----the meaning of being set up so far away from the university seems too weak for this laboratory. Assistant Professor Kigamine's secondary residence</p>
<p class="null-p">(incidentally, the primary residence seemed to be an apartment near Shijo Karasuma) is what it'd be called----or should it be called Kuchiha-chan's secluded residence.</p>
<p class="null-p">No….originally, it was a clinic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly, that might be important. If there is the experimental body that is Kuchiha-chan, it would be more of the domain of human study rather than research…..indeed, it's a subject that would make that perverted dissection enthusiast somewhere cry from joy if she heard about it. "Which reminds me, what is Kokoromi-sensei doing now….." If there is a</p>
<p class="null-p">chance next time, I'll ask Kunagisa to investigate. "Okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">I finished the shower and wiped my wet body with a towel. I put back on the clothes I took o in the changing room. Since my hair had just been shortened by Hime-chan, it will dry out quickly without a dryer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did she say that sort of thing?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did she ask me that sort of thing?</p>
<p class="null-p">If I'm asked, I will end up thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you get an answer, what will you do----</p>
<p class="null-p">"….but it's nonsense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's ridiculous to love a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">It should be ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Up to now, I've never liked or disliked anyone. I've never loved someone or hated someone. I don't feel anything about anyone. I have nothing to do with anyone. Think that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Realize that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it's an illusion, realize.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..let's sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">I put the towel I wiped my hair with in the basket and stretched once.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I got out of the changing room,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah." "Oh."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the hallway was Assistant Professor Kigamine.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wasn't sleeping and it seemed like she was doing work after this, her figure was full of energy. Well, I guess this person's appearance in sleep wear is unimaginable. Even just this person's appearance while sleeping was not within the realms of imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..How do you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good. I had predicted beforehand that I would meet you here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Again, weren't you surprised just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Did you cut your hair?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Didn't you notice?</p>
<p class="null-p">"And your cheek, what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..No, nothing really."</p>
<p class="null-p">This person……</p>
<p class="null-p">Really doesn't care about others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At any rate, it's a disaster. The tires."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I guess the feeling is mutual."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's get some spare tires first thing tomorrow and carry out repairs. You'll need to help me……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's also my problem. I have some experience, so please rely on me.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's also within the earnings of the part-time job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you already sleeping after this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah….I'm not really tired, but my partner was doing her best and is now in fatigue mode. I can't just stay up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so….Yukariki-san right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She is an idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was bluntly told.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was bluntly told like a master cutting down one's opponent. …..Probably, until now, she couldn't tell anyone and, until right this moment, she's been restraining her will to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right….there are also such people in this world….I had lost my mind for just a moment…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Assistant Professor Kigamine is a faculty member at a national university and a scholar. I guess she must not have had a close relationship with an Idiot-chan who can't study in her life. Perhaps she's seeing one for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">A gap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Hime-chan is a good girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I admit that she is good….but good in what kind of sense? By the way"</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine said. "Do you mind talking a little?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh….I'm fine but, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you hear anything from Kuchiha-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly I was cut in a very deep place. Well then, how do I answer….in this case, since I was asked di erently a moment ago, it'll be a bad move to use deception since it's a di erent mood. After a moment of hesitation, I decided to answer honestly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About the undying body and that I'm similar to Kuchiha-chan and</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine's former mentor----I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Is that so. Then, it will be quick."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine lowered her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that's the case, please take a look after her when you're beside her from now on. Do you understand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….But Kuchiha-chan is aware of everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have no intention to hide it. No matter what, if you talk to her for a little bit it will leak out….after all, Kuchiha has always completely seen through my schemes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I have been completely predicted beforehand." Assistant Professor Kigamine had a cool tone and exchanged words without any emotion----at least as far as I was able to observe her tone, she continued. "Still….speaking honestly, I'm at a loss. I'd say that there is darkness in the immediate future----that is why your existence, for me----for us, I think it can become a trigger."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Not dying …." While thinking that it was not something to talk about in a hallway, I said. "What exactly does that mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can imagine the gist of what she herself said but…...according to me, it's as it is , indeed it is entirely as it is . To not die. To not die. Too, noot, diie. The body is always kept at optimal health. Speaking of it in various senses, it does not age."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doesn't age…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The age of her outward appearance is roughly 18 years old….but she has been alive for at least three times that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Three times!?" Eighteen times three…. "54 year old….that's ridiculous….54?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is at a minimum. Thinking arithmetically, it would be wise to think that she has lived three times more than that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Three times that----</p>
<p class="null-p">162 years old.</p>
<p class="null-p">What----is that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's too ridiculous to deny or shake o .</p>
<p class="null-p">"Three times----why is that three times? First what is the basis for that</p>
<p class="null-p">'minimum' line?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She seems to be able to remember only about that far back ….if we follow the theory that brain cells are ROM instead of RAM, it means that you can't waste brain cells….you could say that's the root of her unique personality. Fufufu, this impossible hypothesis has already been proved around here right? Incidentally----the one who was in charge of her before me, my mentor said she was roughly 800 years old."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eight hundred….isn't that Yao Bikuni." (TL : in japanese legends, a human who ate mermaid flesh is called Yao Bikuni and is said to be able to live up to</p>
<p class="null-p">800 years)</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you think it's possible?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think? Overall, a person who lives for nearly ten centuries----do you think such a person can exist?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. I think it's impossible, but----"</p>
<p class="null-p">I know it's impossible, but----</p>
<p class="null-p">I told Assistant Professor Kigamine what I told Hime-chan a short while ago. A cell with perfect regenerative and reproductive capabilities. A metabolism that repeats for eternity. Of course without forgetting to mention these are the thoughts of an amateur. However, Assistant Professor Kigamine just shrugged saying "You say some interesting things." "But----the premise of a cell with perfect regenerative and reproductive capabilities is contradictory in itself. In the first place, within the genes of human cells death itself is preprogrammed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the cellular sense it's apoptosis….no matter whatever state of health you maintain, extending your lifespan only increases the chance of activating the cancer factors that are fundamentally incorporated within genes. It's not simply a mistake in the copying of a cell, but one by one each cell takes over its duties and dies naturally. That's what I mean by if you're alive you will die without fail . Death is already included within life's essential condition."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Romanticism that will never come true, or opportunism as an escape from reality. These two sentences th at Shiogi-chan previously introduced as 'idle gossip', is that what they mean? An absolute contradiction that blindly ignored theory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, growth and evolution, it's a paradox of which is first….a paradox, huh. Fufu." At the word paradox, Assistant Professor Kigamine just laughed. "But, the paradox of the strongest spear and the strongest shield, the spear would obviously win."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shields are tools to parry spears, but spears are tools to stab people.</p>
<p class="null-p">They're not tools to penetrate shields….in reality resisting is well said. ----But. Even if we say that apoptosis being programmed into each cell is an exaggeration, death is only a step to the next life , it is just a step…..then, isn't not dying synonymous with not living ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A paradox, an existence tha t is immortal strictly in the legendary sense is also troublesome. In the first place if cells are immortal, people will no longer grow. The program repeats and repeats and repeats, increasing indefinitely for eternity----then that is just a cancer cell. Because that individual growing endlessly will become enormous….it will be a complete giant that will be like a black hole----no, it will be the birth of a giant that will be forever incomplete . Anyway, even if the cell is automatic or passive, it will never perish. Unless you have the ability to freely and arbitrarily control the life and death of a cell, but that is God's domain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I agree…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Growth and evolution.</p>
<p class="null-p">A paradox.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Furthermore, there is a problem of where the supply of energy that guarantees that growth is----speaking of energy, a comprehensive image is that energy is synonymous with life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"----It is."</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow----I'm at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine, who should be studying immortality, who should be studying Kuchiha-chan----has fatally negated the very thing itself, I had no idea what position to take. Even now, at this moment I had no established foothold.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how confused I was, as usual, Assistant Professor Kigamine didn't seem to worry about me and she continued her monologue saying,</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Fufu, but----it may seem humorous when biologists say childish things, but I think these things are fundamental. Yes, when thinking about the most basic and binary principles---- death, what exactly is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. Death is…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not meeting anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not talking with anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not feeling anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not thinking about anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Generally speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess it must be nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">I remembered the question asked by Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">What does not dying mean?</p>
<p class="null-p">She was reluctant with my ambiguous answer and her answer was---- not dying means never changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, what is death ?</p>
<p class="null-p">" Death means that, forever and forever and forever, there is nothing at all. Speaking strongly, it is darkness….isn't it? In the darkness where the prospects are totally useless, without any news or help, being alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a poet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a nonsense user."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will praise your poetic sensibility itself----but, I think it's a bit more dull….let's see----for example, the general image states that if a person's heart stops, they die. But, since the heart is an involuntary muscle, speaking precisely, it has nothing to do with the human will."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's Kosakai Fuboku."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine responded with a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently she didn't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is such a novel. It's a mystery novel…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are reading unusual books."</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked at me with doubtful eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess that's the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a long established theory that your spirit dwells within the heart----did you know? Since ancient times, people thought that humans think with their hearts. Before the existence of the brain was discovered----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would not necessarily be a mistake. It's the heart that sends blood to the brain and the brain doesn't move the heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's your heart that is pounding.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's also your heart that grows cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's also your heart that is being tested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes----and even the movement of the heart has nothing to do with death . Death , the distinguisher known as death was not birthed by abnormalities in the brain or the internal organs---- rather, that is normal . If you live normally, you will die normally . Because otherwise you can't live. Then, what is her existence?" If not normal----abnormal.</p>
<p class="null-p">If not regular----irregular.</p>
<p class="null-p">" She knows herself ----that's what I think." I said. " That's why you called me ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, even if you cross your legs and think about it, about yourself, I don't think you can understand it yourself. It seems like Kuchiha-chan doesn't know either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah….sure, it may be so. However." Assistant Professor Kigamine said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At least Professor Saitou----managed to grasp something about her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Saitou…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their mentor who I'm said to resemble.</p>
<p class="null-p">According to them, I resemble him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----A rebellion against causality. A revolution against the fate of existence, a declaration of independence confronting the coming inevitability." Assistant Professor Kigamine continued to recite. "That is….in the first place, that person's, Professor Saitou's words. At the time when I received his instruction, I was an ordinary senior high school student….yes, I was at about the age of Yukariki-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, a senior high school student?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I took over his research---- I continued to follow after him, but ----honestly, that load was heavy. Kuchiha doesn't open her heart to me----it's not the first time I took this kind of calculating approach of inviting people like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, that all failed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuchiha-chan said there was a shortage of human resources." "Yes----from Kuchiha's point of view, my plots, no my existence is certainly humorous. But, however, this time, this time----it may be successful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Until now, I knew that Kuchiha noticed my plans and completely ignored them." Assistant Professor Kigamine's words were self-deprecating. "This time, there is a sliver of hope."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A sliver….is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes….I've always continued as a professor but….I'm considerably tired. This is the first time that knowing that there's a plan, knowing that there's a fence, Kuchiha-chan jumped there. The aptitude test, it feels like it was a success. This is the meaning for why the test was taken in this place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">For the first time?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan herself was saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that the interests were aligned. At least based on Assistant Professor Kigamine's</p>
<p class="null-p">observations----Kuchiha-chan is not at all cooperative with the research. In fact, this time, I haven't really figured out how much falsehood was in those words she said or how much miscalculation was involved. But, still, the case this time is strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I----Kigamine Yaku, want to pursue this with every hope and with every means….for the sake of defeating fate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For the sake of cutting open fate."</p>
<p class="null-p">Cutting open fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Destroy causality.</p>
<p class="null-p">Collapse-----the Story.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….It's a job, so I'll obey if ordered." I said. "I'm not so good at tricking serious people with a purpose."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to deceive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Is that so….. It seems that the conversation is over, can I go already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like I understand the reason why Kasugai-san was rude to you and ran away from here. If anything…..it might be because of Kuchiha-chan ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well. there may not be meaning. Even if there is meaning, there is no guarantee that the meaning is meaningful. If you reach the meaning of the meaning of the meaning, it is no longer related to human intellect." "….If you feel it's inhuman to use Kuchiha as an experimental subject then you are o the mark." Assistant Professor Kigamine calmly said. "Her possession of an undying body makes her socially vulnerable. If that comes to light, I don't know what to expect. Somebody….must protect her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Strong is weak, weak is strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">An undying body .</p>
<p class="null-p">Being vigilant of, being regarded as dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe…..</p>
<p class="null-p">Being killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being slaughtered in every way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She has no self defense ability to protect herself."</p>
<p class="null-p">I have no e ect on anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because I needed a place to live and people to take care of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">An undying body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Death.</p>
<p class="null-p">The strength of a person who can commit suicide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I don't think it's inhumane. If I think about my life, it feels like it's too late for that….but, maybe----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's an overstatement."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's it.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was talking too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't have that qualification.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because----I'm not concerned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good night, Assistant Professor Kigamine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yes. Then, see you tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine walked down the hallway without saying anything more to me. In that direction was the laboratory and the library. Anyway, it was probably research work all night. Kuchiha-chan said she was a night person, but she seemed to be working all day. Truly, from the point of view of my lazy self, I really admired that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's something admirable.</p>
<p class="null-p">But….however, maybe Kasugai-san didn't evaluate Assistant Professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine as such.</p>
<p class="null-p">The research she was doing when she was working last month at the Shadou Kyouichirou research facility, which had been destroyed thoroughly by the hands of Kunagisa Tomo and Utsurigi Gaisuke, was incredibly significant, but not something to be praised.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I asked her then, 'why do you do that?' she would reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Because it's work.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking in accordance with that----</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine was not someone to look up to.</p>
<p class="null-p">That person is not working.</p>
<p class="null-p">That person is on a mission.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that probably wasn't what disturbed Kasugai-san. Kasugai-san has a strong spirit that won't be disturbed, she doesn't possess any meaning. That person----she doesn't feel anything about anyone, she's not alive so she isn't dead, someone from that side .</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Separated from Professor Kyouichirou----</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, no one gives her instructions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, no one will give her an order.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that sense, Kasugai-san is probably unstable at the moment. Predicting her actions beforehand was impossible. All together, impossible to predict. Capricious.</p>
<p class="null-p">A personality like a rolling dice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, it's like myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Akari-san, how are you doing----"</p>
<p class="null-p">I diverted my thoughts towards a completely harmless direction and decided to return to my room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah….laying in Akari-san's lap…. That's right, after I finish this part time job I'll go to that island again together with Tomo……I thought I would never go there again."</p>
<p class="null-p">I wish it didn't have that fortune teller.</p>
<p class="null-p">While talking to Assistant Professor Kigamine, my hair had completely dried, while touching it, I walked down the hallway for a moment and then tried to climb the stairs when I ran into Rizumu-chan who was descending. The stairs in this lab are so narrow that only one person can pass. I stopped and waited for Rizumu-chan to descend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Hey Rizu…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like Hime-chan, she was in a long T-shirt borrowed from Kuchiha-chan….now, both her arms were hanging out. Slender and stretched out----long arms. Two arms extending from the cu s of the shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not even a manteau.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not even a straightjacket.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had no expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not Rizumu-chan's innocent smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not even Izumu-kun's outrageous smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had no expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">She who said nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who is she who said nothing, I did not know.</p>
<p class="null-p">He who said nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who is he who said nothing, I did not know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which one?</p>
<p class="null-p">Which is the life of this body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which is the death of this body.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not know at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">A mismatch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which one of the two did not match.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um….is it Izumu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While I couldn't tell whether it was he or she , she passed me and went down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon the figure will be mixed in with the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that direction…..the waiting room? Or is it the front door? But It wasn't the kind of atmosphere that she decided to treat herself to a stroll in the middle of the night. So, where would she go? That direction is the opposite of the bathroom. Is she still half asleep? That expression was the usual for being half asleep, rather than ignoring me, she just didn't notice me.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it wasn't that kind of nuance.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked completely like she was sleepwalking.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is it….is there also a third personality?</p>
<p class="null-p">No way, I haven't heard that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides….that switching of personality wasn't a matter of dimension but was like a transformation.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if the personality had left.</p>
<p class="null-p">Empty,</p>
<p class="null-p">was how she looked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Empty, like well lit darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I considered chasing after her for a moment but the thought of getting involved made my legs stop moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like I didn't think about the worst possibility.</p>
<p class="null-p">That it was Man Eater's side and that he may have just begun moving to slaughter his targets Assistant Professor Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan. Only those two were on the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">….But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was the worst case, it was unrelated to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no reason to defend them.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I get in the way, Izumu-kun will kill me without mercy. That's the duty of a professional killer . In accordance with his reason for being, he will kill me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to get involved.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition, Izumu-kun promised me.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wouldn't kill people in places connected to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you think about it, that is an extraordinary condition. All I needed to do was keep company with a sweet girl like Rizumu-chan. There are a heap of problems, but if it's just getting along, then that mountain can possibly be avoided. You don't have to climb the mountain just because there is one.</p>
<p class="null-p">So----the talent to leave what you do not know without knowing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I climbed the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Returned to the room and opened the door. The lights were o . Looking at the bed, Hime-chan was asleep even if she was covered deeply within the futon. Convenient. Even if Hime-chan was my partner, I didn't want her to see my sleeping face. I would still be able to sleep soundly, but somehow I would be in the same mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">I got into my futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a tough day….I was thinking of contacting Kasugai-san and Miiko-san, but I forgot. Well, it was already tiresome. I mean, that person will be fine and return to the apartment. People who can live alone should live alone. If a person who can't live alone lives alone, they will only have painful experiences. Even so, if you have to, then you have to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next time I opened my eyes, I saw hell.</p>

<p class="null-p">If you don't have bread then starve and die.</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometimes I wish that time could turn back.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is to say, it would be a question like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you could redo your life, from when and from what point in time would you want to start over?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The exemplary answer is simple and clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to start over. I want to die soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">My answer would also be the same as that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hypothetically-- even if time turned back.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, if time turned back to before I met that young blue boy, I would probably still repeat the same things after I had met that young blue boy. No matter how many times I started over, and no matter how many times I started over again, the exact same tragedy would endlessly repeat itself. Like a video recorded in a media log which won't deteriorate, following the same program as if it were sick.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if I returned to before my sister died.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if I returned to before I was born.</p>
<p class="null-p">I would forever repeat the same things.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if it were dictated by the story of destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if submitting to someone's will.</p>
<p class="null-p">The causes are di erent, but the result is the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I think.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it is called childish, even if it is called foolish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it is called nonsense, even if it is called a masterpiece.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be good if time turned back.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had felt like that since before.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, it was still better than now.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is not one thing harsher than the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">If there is a god governing fate, then I'll pray.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm asking you, please don't do a thing anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stay still where you are.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Aah, it's like, I saw a weird dream"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sunlight shining from the gap in the curtains woke me up.</p>
<p class="null-p">I saw a weird dream, but I had already forgotten it. However, this is for once not the fault of my memory, I heard that it is the same for most people. That even if you try to remember them, most dreams are forgotten.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..</p>
<p class="null-p">How do we know that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though we should have forgotten them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe, in fact, we only forget a little …. I don't really know."</p>
<p class="null-p">I also didn't understand this train of thought while I was waking up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was I thinking about that?</p>
<p class="null-p">I glanced over at the other bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems Hime-chan is still sleeping. Even though she should be taking supplementary classes right now, she is quite laid back. But, repairing the Fiat will take some time, so I guess there's no helping it for this morning. Rather, the fact that she has attended every time up until now without slipping is something like a miracle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even with all that she says, I guess she must really love school. I left the room while being careful to not make any noise in order not to wake her up. If possible, I'd like to go wash my face in order to refresh myself, but… I guess the sink in the changing room is fine. The sink in the bathroom was what came to mind at first, but that thing, if I had to choose that, then I would rather not choose at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">I went down to the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Going like this, I went to the changing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was still a bit half asleep. It was like my field of vision and my train of thought were hazy. It was not low blood pressure, I am rather quite good at waking up. I'm good but …. recently, because of Kasugai-san, I have been lacking sleep. I should find a place where I can sleep alone soon … or, I could go spend a week at Kunagisa's place. If it's with her, then I'm completely fine with having her next to me when I sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knocked on the changing room's door, but there was no response, so I opened the door and went inside. I was about to go inside ---- there was nothing before I entered it, it was like walking down Hirao Street, but as I went in ---</p>
<p class="null-p">I had a mysterious intuition.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Hmm? "</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like I had to go ahead and look at that shower room in the back. I wondered why I had this weird feeling. It was a mysterious intuition, but, in reality it was not mysterious at all. It didn't have a concrete form, but rather it was like a vague and fragile conviction.</p>
<p class="null-p">The air was wet. (TL : pronounced as wet, written as extinct)</p>
<p class="null-p">The air was dry. (TL : pronounced as dry, written as blood loss)</p>
<p class="null-p">Intuition?</p>
<p class="null-p">Or maybe, perception.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't really know.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't really know but …..</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it the fault of having just woken up?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't really know but …..</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't really know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or maybe, perception.</p>
<p class="null-p">Intuition?</p>
<p class="null-p">The air was wet. (TL : pronounced as wet, written as extinct)</p>
<p class="null-p">The air was dry. (TL : pronounced as dry, written as blood loss)</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no need to forcefully stop myself from seeing what I wanted to see, what I had decided of my own will to see. However, even with that understanding, I still decided to wash my face in order to make my head as clear as possible and then, finally, I opened the door to the shower room.</p>
<p class="null-p">There, the girl who could not die, was dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was dead to the point where she couldn't be anything more than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was dead to the point where you could not look at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her upper half and her lower half were cut through, and her organs that were packed inside before were leaking out. Her organs must have lost oxygen a while ago, as they had turned into a weird dark brown color. Living organs are very red, red and sparkling. The things coming out of</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan's upper body were, no matter how you look at it, completely without luster, dead organs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slightly, slightly enough so that the sound wouldn't leak out into the changing room, water was flowing out of the shower ….. The smell of blood was faint. That must have washed away all the blood which should have spilled out onto the floor tiles. The thing which had called me, the faint sound of the shower, and the slight smell of blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that was it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The wetness, the dryness. (TL : same lecture as before)</p>
<p class="null-p">Here it was ----</p>
<p class="null-p">Already over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ugh…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I sealed my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">I held back the scream that was about to leak out.</p>
<p class="null-p">I immediately returned from my half-asleep state.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reality?</p>
<p class="null-p">A dream?</p>
<p class="null-p">Which one… is this?</p>
<p class="null-p">The body that appeared to have been ripped in half was …… connected, but only slightly. By one vertebral column, and one layer of skin, it was connected.</p>
<p class="null-p">Flashback.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of the corpses that I had seen up until now passed through my mind. However, even when comparing it to them, this was one of an awful category.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly, of an awful category.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if the organs were.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like the organs were bitten o .</p>
<p class="null-p">The expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan's expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan's expression, the expression that I could see from here … I couldn't understand what it was. It wasn't distorted by pain, but ….. obviously, it wasn't calm either.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I had to say, it was blank.</p>
<p class="null-p">Blue and cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes were closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both her arms and legs were wide open.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her fists were not gripping anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her clothes were the same as from last night, those fancy cat pajamas.</p>
<p class="null-p">The cat was completely black.</p>
<p class="null-p">The cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The cat, the cat, the cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The blood had solidified, and become all black.</p>
<p class="null-p">Black, black, black, black, black, black, black.</p>
<p class="null-p">Black.</p>
<p class="null-p">A black cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">A cat-like black.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm ..….." I asked the person who should be there. "What is this? This</p>
<p class="null-p">…….. these kinds of things are troublesome for me ….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I took one step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's too sudden.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took a second step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">My comprehension can't keep up.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took a third step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Calm down.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took four steps back and got out of the shower room.</p>
<p class="null-p">I closed the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like this, I can't see anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't see anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">" …….! "</p>
<p class="null-p">I rushed towards the sink and, with all the strength in my body, twisted the faucet. With that much strength, a stream of water gushed out. I took some in my hands and washed my face. That's right. I came to wash my face. I came here to wash my face. I came here to wash my face. Huh? Didn't I just wash it earlier? It's fine, it's not like it'll hurt to do it again. Wash wash wash wash wash. I love cleanliness. I love cleanliness. Keep it clean.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fastidiously clean.</p>
<p class="null-p">Become calm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Become cruel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha, ha, ha, ha….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm su ocating.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's hard to breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did I drink the water?</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I forgot to breathe.</p>
<p class="null-p">Am I an idiot, I'm going to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the water running, I ran away again, leaving the changing room and moving into the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">I realized suddenly and closed the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ughhh …….."</p>
<p class="null-p">How…..did it get to this point?</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this development?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why is Kuchiha-chan dead?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right. Maybe it's a grand scheme to surprise me. Kuchiha-chan has a body that cannot die . She's not going to die from having her organs pulled out. Surely, even now, she is going to open the door and say something like "Surprise! Ha ha ha, I really scared you".</p>
<p class="null-p">Her organs were still sticking out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still expressionless.</p>
<p class="null-p">She'd appear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……...Ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">I remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last night, I saw Rizumu-chan…. or was it Izumu-kun, I don't know which, but it was the undivided Cannibal that no one knows.</p>
<p class="null-p">The professional killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one whose job is to kill.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, if I asked they would answer like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because it is work".</p>
<p class="null-p">Work must be accomplished.</p>
<p class="null-p">Accomplishing work is not the important thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Work has to deliver results.</p>
<p class="null-p">With an unsteady head, I forcibly stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">With an unsteady body, I pushed myself up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Assistant professor…….Kigamine"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is where?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is she safe?</p>
<p class="null-p">Nocturnal…..she said she was going to work. So……. the laboratory or the library, I think she walked in that direction. If my memory is correct. I hope that my memory is correct but, if my memory is correct, my memory has never been correct even once.</p>
<p class="null-p">Memory?</p>
<p class="null-p">This kind of thing, I want to forget as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">I only remember bad things.</p>
<p class="null-p">I only remember bad people.</p>
<p class="null-p">I only know bad things.</p>
<p class="null-p">I only know bad people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not dead ….. not dead"</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked down the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first room was the laboratory.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knocked. Knocking is important. After all, that's proper manners. It's rude if you don't respect manners. Insolent, and impolite. You will get scolded. I hate being scolded. And, if you knock, what a surprise, you will clarify whether someone is inside. Knocking possesses all of these surprising advantages. There is no situation where it won't work.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no response.</p>
<p class="null-p">I twisted the knob.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was locked.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no response and it was locked.</p>
<p class="null-p">That means there is nobody inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Does that mean there is nobody alive?</p>
<p class="null-p">Without taking time to think, I hit the door with my shoulder. With all my force, without any mercy, for the door, or for myself. Without a fragment of care.</p>
<p class="null-p">After five times, the door creaked, tilted, and a gap opened. Then I realized all the pain. I don't care. I always feel pain. I always get hurt. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was really no one inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">If there was someone inside, and that person was dead, and the room was locked, that would make it a locked room, wouldn't it? Realistically, that kind of thing is impossible. Impossible things don't happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally.</p>
<p class="null-p">I touched my shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bone was fine, it was not broken.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's strange. How is it not broken?</p>
<p class="null-p">While tilting my head, I advanced further into the hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">The library.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knocked. Knocking is important. After all, that's proper manners. It's rude if you don't respect manners. Insolent, and impolite. You will get scolded. I hate being scolded. And, if you knock, what a surprise, you will clarify whether someone is inside. Knocking possesses all of these surprising advantages. There is no situation where it won't work.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no response.</p>
<p class="null-p">I twisted the knob.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't locked.</p>
<p class="null-p">There, Assistant Professor Kigamine was dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting on a chair with her face lying on the desk. Her eyes were facing towards me, but they were cloudy. Those were dead eyes. She was not alive. Certainly. There was nothing that could be done. With a likelihood of a hundred percent.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">The human neck doesn't bend at such an angle.</p>
<p class="null-p">And one more thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her right shoulder was completely ripped o .</p>
<p class="null-p">There were marks of her blood having gushed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had already almost stopped flowing out.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was already almost hardened.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was red-black and hardened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or --- did it run out?</p>
<p class="null-p">This smell.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't notice it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why is that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it because it was sealed?</p>
<p class="null-p">The smell of blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">The smell of death was sealed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now it was no longer closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Death --- was released.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I tried to get closer, but I hesitated.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I got closer, I felt like I would be trapped.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">This feeling is ----- bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, I was fascinated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Death, death, death, death, death, death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Madoka Kuchiha's corpse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine Yaku's corpse.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was fascinated by those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm attracted to them. Attracted to them. Uncontrollably, without limit. An attraction with a force strong enough to draw together two massive objects across an enormous distance was physically pulling me towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is ----- yearning.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was yearning for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh. Ughhh"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time it was not one step at a time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I moved back four steps at once and closed the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">The smell disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">A former clinic. I see, it had that kind of structure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely sealed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Death was once again completely sealed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How, how did it come to this point"</p>
<p class="null-p">If assistant professor Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan are dead, then the part-time job won't happen, right? Even though it begins next week. Does that mean Miiko-san won't be able to get her hanging scroll? Isn't that the problem here? I understand that. That kind of thing, I understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Do you think I don't even know that kind of thing?</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, Izumu, kun--"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the only thing I could think about now.</p>
<p class="null-p">His work.</p>
<p class="null-p">A professional killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a thing, that liar.</p>
<p class="null-p">He told me he wouldn't kill anyone in front of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's laughable, what a fool.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did I believe in what a professional killer said?</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't say, after all that, that you were betrayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't say that you believed him up until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't that what you thought?</p>
<p class="null-p">That tomorrow, those two could be dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">That still, it doesn't involve you.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what you thought, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why are you surprised with things going as you had predicted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rejoice, your predictions were right.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Shut up! "</p>
<p class="null-p">I ran through the hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should have been running straight, but I ran into things left and right. I ran into the wall, I ran into the corners, I ran into door knobs here and there, and tripped where there was nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was pathetic.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up ….be quiet! I am normal!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I arrived at the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">I climbed.</p>
<p class="null-p">There, slowly.</p>
<p class="null-p">One step at a time, one step at a time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I climbed like I was abandoning.</p>
<p class="null-p">" I didn't predict anything I didn't think anything I didn't feel anything I didn't think about anything I didn't rush anything I didn't regret anything</p>
<p class="null-p">I "</p>
<p class="null-p">I finished climbing the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once more, I ran.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stopped in front of the room where Rizumu-chan was sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, I didn't knock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Izumu-kun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Niounomiya siblings were dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A snap, I heard a crack forming in my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Snap, snap, snap.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was already at my maximum limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">My brain started to run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Has it already started?</p>
<p class="null-p">That's no good, at this rate.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is going to get away. I can't catch up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Eeeh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body on the bed was, bloodstained. Bloodstained.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bloodstained.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, the blood turned into a weird red-black color.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's natural.</p>
<p class="null-p">The neck was torn o .</p>
<p class="null-p">At the neck, the head and the body were split into two.</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely, without letting a single layer of skin connecting them, it was completed.</p>
<p class="null-p">A headless corpse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just that was enough, even though it was more than enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the base of the chest, as if it had been drilled through, there was a large wound.</p>
<p class="null-p">The T-shirt borrowed from Kuchiha-chan was destroyed and, in the depths, in the place where the heart should have been, there was a big, big, big, big, deep, deep, deep, deep ----- wound.</p>
<p class="null-p">More than a wound, it was a hole.</p>
<p class="null-p">It went through.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having her head cut o .</p>
<p class="null-p">Having her chest opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been killed twice .</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it would be like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because there were two personalities.</p>
<p class="null-p">Twice.</p>
<p class="null-p">You would have to kill twice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It doesn't count as having died, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">'I love you!'</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">I remembered Rizumu-chan's smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Gyahahaha!'</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">I remember Izumu-kun's laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to remember that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please stop please stop please stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rizumu-chan Izumu-kun Rizumu-chan Izumu-kun Rizumu-chan</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun Rizumu-chan Izumu-kun Rizumu-chan Izumu-kun…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What will calling them do?</p>
<p class="null-p">I know there will be no answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I don't know. How would I know?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to understand, I don't want to break.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">You...you should be a feared professional assassin, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu the Carnival and Izumu the Man Eater .</p>
<p class="null-p">The assassination techniques of the Niounomiya siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">They won't die from having their head cut o and their chest pierced.</p>
<p class="null-p">You won't die, right? There is no way you can die.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if you try to surprise me, it won't go like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I'm used to having people die.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point that kind of thing won't surprise me.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the corner of the room, there was that manteau, and that straitjacket, folded and left behind. Huh, straitjackets can be folded like that. That seems like quite a di cult structure to fold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Hey, Rizumu-chan…."</p>
<p class="null-p">No response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Hey, Izumu-kun…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">No response.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's calm down.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm cool.</p>
<p class="null-p">First, choose. Your actions from now on, choose them. Should I sort out this situation, or should I stay confused? The latter is clearly the easier choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Choosing that would surely be the correct choice. But I chose the former.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, I was confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">Madoka Kuchiha was dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant professor Kigamine was dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Niounomiya siblings were dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's probably a connection there.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, everyone is dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone was killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">A common point.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, the chain of deaths connected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. and "</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew two things.</p>
<p class="null-p">About Assistant Professor Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan I understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were the professional killer 's targets.</p>
<p class="null-p">Targets are killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is the rule.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is common sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">At minimum, it's courtesy.</p>
<p class="null-p">" But……why is Izumu-kun…. "</p>
<p class="null-p">Or why is Rizumu-chan .</p>
<p class="null-p">Dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't need to understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………………………………………………………………….I need to flee"</p>
<p class="null-p">I have to wake up Hime-chan and flee.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Fiat is no good, so with the bicycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">We don't need to go over the mountain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least, somewhere that is not here.</p>
<p class="null-p">This place is-----no good .</p>
<p class="null-p">This place is already finished .</p>
<p class="null-p">I removed the Niounomiya siblings from my field vision, and left the room. I open the door of the next hospital room. I didn't knock. I didn't have the composure to think about that. What is knocking?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ichihime! Wake up!" I rushed over to the bed and shook Hime-chan who was still in her futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are going to escape from here…...things have become……..a mess"</p>
<p class="null-p">I noticed something strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">My hand that tried to shake her sank.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is not the elasticity of a human body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I lifted up the futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside there was a futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">The futon was wearing a futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how you look at it, it's a futon. Without any subterfuge, a splendid futon. A person not calling that a futon would have a screw loose. If your head is normal, then your eyes are strange. If your eyes are fine then your head is strange. Anyway, I think something is strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">No.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I am strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">I must be abnormal.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't possess any normality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I tilted my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where is Hime-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Where is Hime-chan?</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan was dead in the courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her arms were-------torn from her elbows.</p>
<p class="null-p">And her neck was twisted in an impossible direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was dead inside a puddle of blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no hope.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Pieces of meat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The smell of blood. A puddle of blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that small body, where, where was this much blood?</p>
<p class="null-p">Plenty.</p>
<p class="null-p">Drifting about.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like that small body was floating inside it.</p>

<p class="null-p">A twisted neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pupils without life. Pupils without sparks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her pupils were open as if looking at evil itself, but her eyes weren't warped in fear nor frozen with heroism, they were hollow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her ribbon was untied.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hair she was growing was disturbed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cruel, cruel, cruel.</p>

<p class="null-p">Her still new uniform was torn everywhere.</p>

<p class="null-p">Yukariki Ichihime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yukariki Ichihime's development was ordinary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normal and a little unusual.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a plain, ordinary story.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unfortunately, this was not a story that can satisfy both with bad taste and evil curiosity. This was not a story that could be told and listened to, even if you strained your ears to listen, this was not a story that can be made clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">The story itself was a common story.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is nothing new, no surprising development.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was moderately misfortunate.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was moderately tragic.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was moderately cruel.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Yukariki Ichihime was not a moderate girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, it was very misfortunate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, it was very tragic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, it was very cruel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being saved by Aikawa Jun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving training from Shisei Yuma.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet for her it was still misfortunate, tragic, and cruel.</p>
<p class="null-p">It doesn't change.</p>
<p class="null-p">Essentially nothing changes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The case from June as well, in the end it was because she was not moderate that it happened. If she was a little bit more moderate, such a tragedy wouldn't have happened. Yes, let's admit it. Let's admit it, why not admit it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yukariki Ichihime was not by any means a victim.</p>
<p class="null-p">You could even say she was the perpetrator.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she was of a di erent kind, peculiar, and grotesque. Her bright smile was a deception, her bright words were hypocrisy, her bright posture was a disguise, her bright atmosphere was a fabrication.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything was artificial and hopelessly distorted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she was of a di erent kind, peculiar, and grotesque.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she was the perpetrator.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But-----even then, what is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the puddle of blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Drifting about as if eaten and scattered. Losing both of her reliable arms, losing all thoughts and desires and wishes and prayer, hollow, empty eyes. That expression,</p>
<p class="null-p">that figure,</p>
<p class="null-p">is she not a victim?</p>
<p class="null-p">I gazed upon it from afar.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took my phone from my pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">I pressed the buttons I remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah….It's me"</p>
<p class="null-p">The phone connected, I said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"People…...are dead"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice answered on the other side of the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"People, died"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Including me, five people…...when I woke up this morning, four people, were dead"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Except me, everyone is dead"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to escape, but I'm somewhat in the mountains……..the cars were all destroyed…..." "And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please help me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Wait there. Don't do anything, at all. Don't contact the police, or anywhere else. Leave it to boku-sama-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ok…..later."</p>
<p class="null-p">I hung up the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I also turned o the power.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I walked up to Hime-chan, one step at a time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Already-----I don't remember anyone anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine, Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Niounomiya, Rizumu-chan, Izumu-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of it disappeared and flew away.</p>
<p class="null-p">I erased everything</p>
<p class="null-p">I consumed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..sorry, Hime-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">I stepped my foot in the blood puddle.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was still not completely dry and it made a splashing sound. My shoes were dirty. Dirty? Do I want to say that they are dirty, because they have human blood on them? It's blood. It's part of a human. Do I want to insult that?</p>
<p class="null-p">It has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gently, I held Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Preserving the scene, why would I care about that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaaaah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan has died.</p>
<p class="null-p">Died.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have always caused trouble for you…..I feel bad, for always involving you in all this…… even now. It's true. True. True. It's not a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">I muttered to myself creepily.</p>
<p class="null-p">This guy, what is he talking about?</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I didn't stop talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't control myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For Hime-chan, it was only the beginning……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master"</p>
<p class="null-p">I remembered when Hime-chan said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When do you feel happy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……...?" I didn't get the point of the question and tilted my head like a fool.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh…. Sorry, but I don't really get the meaning of that question." "Theereefooree. Uh, at what time, in which moments did you feel like you were glad to be alive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that living together with three older maids in a four-tatami apartment would be happiness, but I've had no such experience"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you had you'd get the death penalty"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being executed seems a little overboard"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a thought crime"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just that…...? But, happiness huh…….I never thought about that. I don't think I can have it, and especially, I don't think I want to have it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine being that way. Being able to live normally, going to university normally, usually getting along with the people around me, occasionally working part-time, going on trips, that kind of normal, perfectly ordinary way of living, suits me. It's all I need. In particular, I don't need anything. In particular, I don't want anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um. You don't have something you want. Something personal. Some people answered that they would be happy if there was world peace." "I don't care about the world. Thinking about the world, can the world make me happy? That's completely laughable. Right now, I'm only thinking about present things. Isn't that fine? There's no need to worry about winning the lottery, or achieving great financial success, or fulfilling an old dream. If today and tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, I and the people around me can manage to continue living properly, then don't you think that's fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. Ah, I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">A charming smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that is what makes Master happy"</p>
<p class="null-p">Happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's apparently happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's that?</p>
<p class="null-p">What does that mean?</p>
<p class="null-p">What are you saying?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't have such a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even an ordinary one wouldn't suit me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's already been too late for me since long ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Hime-chan is not me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike me, Hime-chan had a future. Finally, she had something ahead of her. Finally, she could see the things which had not yet come. Living wasn't completely full of bad things, Hime-chan should have finally started to think that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that point, was it too late?</p>
<p class="null-p">At that point, was it no good?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was too late, was it no good?</p>
<p class="null-p">For me, and for Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are you saying that from the start, we had already failed?</p>
<p class="null-p">She should have been happy now.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that she was happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan said that every day is fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why couldn't she obtain even just that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it something that outrageous?</p>
<p class="null-p">Can an unfortunate person not be happy?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just from being unfortunate you can't become happy?</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like she wanted to become more happy than other people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even half of that is fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even ten percent of that is fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">If only she wasn't unfortunate, it would have been fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like she wanted something.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like she wanted anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime……chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">Heavy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan's body was heavy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it should be light.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan's body, which should have been as light as a feather, was far heavier than the Earth. Heavy, like a weight only able to destroy, like it was meant to torture me. Cutting and cutting and cutting until the last moment until the last moment until the last moment. Tormenting. Choking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strangling. Closing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Creating a blockage.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was about to get killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's scary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really scary.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Blue.</p>
<p class="null-p">The weather is great</p>
<p class="null-p">There is even a pleasant breeze blowing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It goes well with a Japanese house.</p>
<p class="null-p">A good place.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is a good place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Living in a place like this wouldn't be bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess Kuchiha-chan must have liked it too. She said something like that. That this place has a nice environment. That's right. This is a very nice environment for people to live in.</p>
<p class="null-p">However-------there is no one here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is only me here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nobody…..nothing to do with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">No sound, no light.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if isolated from the world, I was secluded.</p>
<p class="null-p">This place is dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">Solitude inside the dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">Darkness is dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without any hope, with only despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hate this. I don't like this place.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's like torture.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is the prison of destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">The guillotine of fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to be in this place.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't like being alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please don't leave me alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I've had enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please leave me alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to feel like this</p>
<p class="null-p">These feelings, I didn't want them.</p>
<p class="null-p">For what purpose was I born?</p>
<p class="null-p">With what meaning was I born?</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least--------not to feel like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was to feel like this, then I would rather have not been born. If it was for this pathetic feeling, for the feeling like it would be far better to just die, I would rather not have been born. I wish I had been killed last month. I wish I had been killed two months ago. And before that and before that and before that and before that, any time, any way, as long I knew that sense of loss that could not be escaped, like darkness, then quickly, sometime and somewhere before now, I wish I had been killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wish I didn't exist from the beginning.</p>
<p class="null-p">I came to think that everything was wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">I came to think that living itself was wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">I came to think that everything was a failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">I came to think that not being dead itself was a failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry….Hime-chan. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry……." I muttered and muttered and muttered and muttered and muttered like a madman. "I am……..even in this situation, someone who cannot cry it seems……"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no response from Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even without a response I continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">I continue my nonsense without substance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----In that case, I shouldn't have saved her that time. At that time, still-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dying wouldn't have been scary."</p>
<p class="null-p">You were scared, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Because you seemed to be having fun. When you were talking with Miiko-san, when you were playing with Moeta-kun and Houkou-chan, when that idiot Nanananami kept you company, when you joked with</p>
<p class="null-p">Koutoumaru-san, and you made friends at school, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Right, you introduced them to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">You had someone you liked, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly, you seemed to be having fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wish I hadn't known that.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a feeling like mine right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">She went to die?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuuuuhhhhhh"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no longer even words.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was nothing to be done anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, I beg you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone please kill me now.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to run into any more pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">I won't tell you to turn back time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I won't request that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">So please, don't advance time anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's end it here.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm fine with a bad end, just end it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't continue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't continue, don't continue, don't continue!</p>
<p class="null-p">Stop continuing with inertia!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well I guess I'll die …"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprisingly honestly, I thought that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well I guess I'll die …"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, I will end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if destiny and the inevitable and causality and fate don't end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only I will end.</p>
<p class="null-p">The me right now is not afraid to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">I only know despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a two story building, jumping won't kill me. Is there a knife somewhere? There should at least be knives in the kitchen. And it's a former clinic, so there should be scalpels. It's fine even if there's not. I just need to hit my head against the wall and I'll die. There are infinite ways. It's fine, after all it was a worthless life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's end it around here.</p>
<p class="null-p">The terminus.</p>
<p class="null-p">The final stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">The end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan and I were in a casual relationship. If it weren't for Aikawa-san let alone encountering her, I wouldn't have known her existence. She's a resident of another world. A resident on the same side as Shiogi-chan and Tamamo-chan. Even if she laughs friendly and thoughtlessly, even if she talks innocently and like she's having fun, even then she is definitively di erent from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">She is di erent, so she is unrelated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unrelated.</p>
<p class="null-p">She is unrelated.</p>
<p class="null-p">To begin with, I was bad at dealing with Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">She is too familiar, she resembles Kunagisa.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she resembles me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was bad at dealing with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">What am I doing, dying for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am not that kind of guy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm not such a good guy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm a defective product.</p>
<p class="null-p">My circuits that feel those kinds of things are broken.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't have any emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am not feeling any emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't feel anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't feel.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am not sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because Hime-chan died…...what does that do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I released Hime-chan's body. She fell in the blood puddle with a splash, her small body. I stood up. I touched my face with my hands covered in blood. It had a slimy feeling. It feels disturbing. It feels disturbing. It feels disturbing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It feels disturbing. It feels disgusting. It feels disgusting. It feels disgusting.</p>
<p class="null-p">It feels disgusting. It feels disgusting.</p>
<p class="null-p">It feels good.</p>
<p class="null-p">I licked one finger covered in blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had a bad taste.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Blood that had touched the air was just iron.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a thing is not a part of a human being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's wait for help while drinking tea or something….."</p>
<p class="null-p">If I go to the kitchen, I should be able to boil some hot water. I'm sure even Kunagisa will have various formalities to go through, and coming here would take about an hour.</p>
<p class="null-p">I will wash away this blood in the shower room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then I will borrow a book from the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll drink some tea and wait.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was about to start moving my feet towards the entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right"</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had forgotten.</p>
<p class="null-p">Good grief.</p>
<p class="null-p">What am I doing forgetting important things like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hime-chan, you did good"</p>
<p class="null-p">Bye bye.</p>
<p class="null-p">Farewell.</p>
<p class="null-p">Goodnight.</p>

<p class="null-p">If you don't obtain trust, you can't betray.</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">This is what comes to mind when thinking about Kunagisa Tomo.</p>
<p class="null-p">Blue hair. Blue eyes. Friend. Innocent. Pure. Engineer. Same age. Only knows how to smile. Blue savant. Kunagisa Syndicate. Kunagisa Nao. Kasumioka Douji. Team . Dead blue. Cheetah, Green Green Green, Double Flick, Reverse</p>
<p class="null-p">Cross , Cubic Loop , Dancing with Madness , Bad Kind , Trigger-Happy End .</p>
<p class="null-p">Terrorist of the digital world. Blue fairy. Geocide. Can't go down stairs alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Can't climb stairs alone. Recharging. Selfish. Miniature garden. Weak. Nocturnal. Single-mindedly concentrating on one thing. Unclear way of speaking. Boku-sama-chan. Feels good and flu y when touched. Hates baths. Persian blue. Doesn't grow. Absolute stoppage. Absolute stagnation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dominator. An existence like family. A concept like a little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Outstanding memory. Once she learns something, she never forgets it. Rich. Currently disowned. Apartment in Shirosaki. Mainframe. Her roots spread all over the world. Device. Inhuman. Atypical. An important existence for me. An irreplaceable existence for me. The existence I loved. Back when I was not fully broken, the existence I loved. The existence who thoroughly destroyed me. The existence I thoroughly destroyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since then.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know what happened since then.</p>
<p class="null-p">But probably, it was dealt with appropriately.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not a case on a secluded island, so it's probably impossible to completely erase it, but----at the very least it was not a case of a magnitude so large that it can't be covered up. At most, only four humans died. If we compare it to a missile falling in war, it's not a big deal. Four people is only half of eight people, and a tenth of forty people. After all, it was just that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah…….</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that I think about it, it's a story without emotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before I rushed over to Hime-chan, I asked for Kunagisa's help. I thought about self-protection first. Unconsciously, I ran towards self-protection.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, I'm the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm truly the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ii-cha-n?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After there was a knock, the door opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, blue hair from the other side..</p>
<p class="null-p">It was kunagisa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ii-chan, did you wake up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm…….? Woke up you say…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh. I was sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">Deeply---So as to not dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like I was dead. Like usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..What time is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ten in the night. The hour boku-sama-chan begins operating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah….right, and, what day is today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uni?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What day is today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you playing stupid? It's the seventeenth of August."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Um………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that was still only yesterday's story.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is that it?</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought a hundred years had passed already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ii-cha-n. Get up get up get up get up get up get up get up get up-" approaching me, clap clap clap clap clap clap clap, she hit a sixteen beat rhythm on my cheeks. "When boku-sama-chan is awake and Ii-chan is sleeping, such a situation is boring-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….that's, my bad"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm hungry. Make something!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ok"</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh, I was sleeping while sitting?</p>
<p class="null-p">It's quite skillful, if I say so myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….huh?" As I was leaving the room, I tilted my head. "Tomo….where are we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In boku-sama-chan's home. Why are you asking that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why am I here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Kunagisa-punch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was hit with an uppercut.</p>
<p class="null-p">From what I saw, she was pouting slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, Ii-chan. Even though boku-sama-chan is generously taking care of you, saying those kinds of things means punishment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm--, Wait wait. I remembered."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">From that lab I was directly put in an unknown car by a person I don't know, and directly, without returning to the apartment, without contacting anyone, I went to Kunagisa' apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, I mumbled a lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after that I slept.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if I was dead, I slept.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ii-chan, have you not been sleeping much recently? You were sleeping a looot! Soundly sleeping. Or, is it more like sleeping like a log?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Boku-sama-chan did all sorts of pranks on Ii-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-fu-fu" Kunagisa laughed maliciously. "Ii-chan is quite bold when he's sleeping."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu-" It was a nasty, provocative laugh. "Well, despite whatever I said out loud, your body is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You bastard! What did you do to my body!? Hey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya-ha-ha, wai--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While laughing like she was having fun, as one would expect on her territory, she escaped in an instant. Being able to disappear in this large apartment means I can't catch her anymore. What a guy….attacking when people are sleeping. Even I couldn't do such a fiendish act. …..But that's why</p>
<p class="null-p">I was short on sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean it's a joke, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">You said it was a joke, right, Kunagisa-san?</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, I'm sorry for making you worry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">I gave up and headed to the kitchen. While avoiding all the cables spread out under my feet like traps. Not only on the floor, but on the ceiling and the walls, an innumerable amount of cables were laid out. It's like it became even worse than the last time I came…..It's like a machine that has its own will, expanding over this space.</p>
<p class="null-p">I opened the refrigerator in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="null-p">…….It's a mystery how the ones that I had made last month still remained as they were. I mean, most of the contents of the refrigerator were annihilated. Did she spend the last half month just eating junk food? What a monster. There was nothing I could do, so I gave up and changed my focus towards the freezer. There should still be a little hope there. Frozen food is quite dull, but…...I'm not in a condition where I can cook any sort of refined dishes. The condiments should still be here, ah, as expected they were as I left them. I half-mindedly made some side dishes that might fill the stomach while cooking rice. The rice cooker. When Kunagisa eats she eats a lot. When she doesn't eat she doesn't eat at all. She's that type. Which reminds me, the chef on that island……..uuuum, what was her name again, the dishes she served at a relatively regular basis were delicious to eat every day. If you get to that level, it changes everything up to your everyday habits.</p>
<p class="null-p">After having spent about an hour cooking "Hey, Tomo, I made some food so get over here!" I called her, but got no response. Either she didn't hear me, or she did hear me but pretended like she didn't. There were no trays or anything that convenient here. I had no choice, so I carried each plate one at a time into the dining room (from what I could see, this room was usually not used at all and there was quite a lot of dust piled up. Not to use Kuchiha-chan's words, but when people don't use something dust piles up. It's the same for humans). After carrying in one plate, I thought of cleaning up first, so I decided to go look for a rag. Thirty minutes later, I was ready to go and call Kunagisa. It didn't really matter what dish I made since it went cold anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the food!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eat up"</p>
<p class="null-p">Greedly, Kunagisa extended both of her hands which were equipped with chopsticks towards the plate. When she's like that voices don't reach her. In regards to the type of people that don't talk when eating, when it's like the fox masked man it's cool, but in this case she is just someone who is obsessed with food. If you don't eat while you can, you don't know when you might die from starvation. If she was like this even on the day of her medical checkup, Nao-san he would have been quite worried…...that guy, he is quite obsessed with his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's bad, I remembered it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the meal!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're welcome"</p>
<p class="null-p">After having both finished eating, I thought of quickly doing the dishes, but when I was gathering the plates. "Ah! Ii-chan. Ii-chan Ii-chan Ii-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa called me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You only have to say Ii-chan once"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ok ok"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You only have to say ok once too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have something to report."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa had an expression like it was not much, a soft expression going funyaa- like always, but since her sense of value is completely di erent from that of a normal person, you shouldn't trust in the emotion that you can read on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's about the circumstances Ii-chan got involved with yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't cover it up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?" I put down the plates that I gathered, sat down, and asked "What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How should I say it? It's a bit out of the jurisdiction of the Kunagisa organization, there's a slight problem. No, since boku-sama-chan is now an outsider, it's only hearsay but" Kunagisa said while staring at the empty plates. It was as if a part of her was thinking, should I lick the plates, what should I do, will I get scolded. "The Assistant Professor Kigamine Yaku is fine. The caretaker Madoka Kuchiha is also fine. Those two, we can do something about it. We can manage to do something about those two. After that they will become plains and mountains. I mean, no matter what, the future will take care of itself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, the other two"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The other two….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"One of them, Yukariki Ichihime, is a resident of the same apartment where Ii-chan lives. Then-----Niounomiya Rizumu. Well, for her, you could also call her Niounomiya Izumu so, technically speaking, three people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"These three are outside the range of the Kunagisa Syndicate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There---In the Kunagisa Syndicate, there are things that are out of its range? In that unarguably absolute organization?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than out of range, it's more like it's in someone else's garden, someone else's territory. How should I put it? It would be easy to understand if I drew it on a char, but…...well, I guess it's fine. It'll be a really lazy and simplified explanation, but please listen carefully."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….My will to listen completely vanished with that lead in……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This world is split in four di erent stable worlds. And all of these worlds overlap with each other a little."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you a cult leader or something……" I was a bit lost. "Please explain it in a more normal way of talking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ro-ger. Then, um, the four worlds, first there is the normal world. The here and now I guess. A world of war and peace, well-suited for everyday life. This is the base. The standard. If you think of how much you can use it as a criteria, let's see, that place where Ii-chan studied abroad, the ER3</p>
<p class="null-p">System. That is at the very limit of the normal world .</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..you're saying that is normal ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, just barely, that's the bottom." Kunagisa explained as if carelessly reciting the multiplication table. "And the remaining three. If you say that the everyday world is the one on the front, then they are the back I guess. To begin with, there is the world centered around the Kunagisa organization. This is the world of political power. Ichigai, Nishiori, Sanzaka, Shikabane,</p>
<p class="null-p">Gotoride, Rokukase, the seventh name is skipped over, and lastly Hachikiri. The Kunagisa Syndicate is what governs them. Since it's sort of like a society it's not that well known, but its power is quite wide. Then, you remember, right…..Iria-chan. Iria-chan of Wet Crow's Feathers Island. The world centered on the four gods and one mirror, including the Akagami family to which Ilia belonged. This is the world of financial power. Akagami, Iigami, Ujigami, Ekagami, Origami. The financial conglomerates----If you want to compare it to something similar to that in the surface world, then I guess the upper echelon of society would be there. You know that Rule is said to be the Japanese ER3 System, right? In reality there's a paper-thin di erence between them-----they're both of equally bad character."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm--well, you may be right"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Finally, the last world---the last both numerically and conceptually. ….There was that serial killer in May, right? The one you told me about before. That Zerozaki something person. With that kind of evil spirit at the core--the world of combat abilities. In short, the inhabitants of that world are monsters. It has the feeling of being a place where no human being should live. It's in a state where there are a variety of heterogeneous forces. Unlike the Kunagisa Syndicate and the four gods and one mirror, the denizens of that world don't act with any objective in particular, but the abilities they possess are overwhelmingly dangerous. The rule there is that there are no rules. Being a match for one thousand is the expression that was created just for the sake of adapting to this….just the power of that expression is enough to make the other three worlds freeze, they are the personification of grotesque. These three worlds have fused together in various ways but, while there is fusion, there is also opposition."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like a power balance. It's vague, but I remember having heard something about a three way deadlock….from when I was a child. Well, it's true though that I wasn't really aware of this six years ago…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. Then the explanation will be quick" Kunagisa said. It seems she decided to not lick the plates, and she looked at me normally. "Ii-chan probably knows, but that Yukariki girl seems to have a link with the Origami, a branch of the four gods and the mirror. She was one of the soldiers of their private army…..but boku-sama-chan doesn't think that</p>
<p class="null-p">Ii-chan doesn't know about that. And then, Niounomiya is-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that too. They are killers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. the Massacre Magic Group, the Niounomiya's Performing Arts group. In the period when boku-sama-chan was a terrorist, I used my nerves to not get involved with them. Even in the a air with Zerozaki-kun, that was also the case. They're too similar…..so it's scary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Scary, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. And, therefore, it's outside of our jurisdiction."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Therefore , you say……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's right. Therefore and it's over, that's all, not half-assedly but completely it doesn't concern me. That's where the logic establishes itself. Well, having said that, it doesn't seem to be as big of a deal as I was worried about. This won't break the power balance or anything like that. The balance is so completely and abnormally firm that it doesn't seem like the life of at most one or two people will do anything to it. However--- That's precisely why it's di cult to cover it up"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really get it…….what does that mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, I said that even in that three way deadlock things are merging together , right? That's why every piece of information, whatever it is, will be passed over to that side by someone. It's an internal problem so it can't be completely closed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's what that meant…."</p>
<p class="null-p">You can't seal a person's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not a problem that simple but, ultimately, that's what it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I don't think just that means you can't cover it up…..in short, you just need to not leak it to the front , the surface world. Isn't that right?" "When boku-sama-chan says we can't hide it" Kunagisa lifted the ends of her eyes with both of her index fingers. I don't think it resembled that person at all, but I knew who it was. "That means that I can't hide it from</p>
<p class="null-p">Jun-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa----Jun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Humanity's strongest contractor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was that Yukariki girl, right? She was involved with Jun-chan and had a relationship with Jun-chan, right? That's a bit bad for Ii-chan." Kunagisa continued without stopping. "Because it seems like that Yukariki-chan died because of Ii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">For an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Excuses were passing through my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's not it . That's wrong .</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I couldn't say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because---It was true.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well--It's Jun-chan so I doubt she is going to judge you, but it'll be awkward. If I could hide it then I would have done it but, if that side were to step in, it would be impossible. If it's not exposed from the inside, then Jun-chan will definitely find out from somewhere else. That's because Jun- chan is familiar with all of the three worlds I just mentioned. And also, I introduced Chii-kun to her the other day. So, if she wants to know something, then there is nothing in the galaxy she can't find out. Really, that was a failure. Boku-sama-chan had promised not to introduce anyone in the first place. That's why boku-sama-chan will try to help as much as possible but, even then, hiding that from Jun-chan will last for three days at most."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't really intend to hide it from Aikawa-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sought help from you because if there were five people and four died, then I would certainly be the culprit . If that happens, it'll be inconvenient in various ways. If I wasn't there, then it would have been fine to not do anything about the case itself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why it's fine if Aikawa-san knows. Rather, that's what I want. I don't know the reason why that case happened but…… if I don't know, then I'm fine with not knowing. Aikawa-san will solve this case beautifully like always"</p>
<p class="null-p">" The reason why that happened , huh" Kunagisa repeated with some hidden meaning. "I will ask just in case. Ii-chan, in this case, is Ii-chan not the culprit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Why do you think that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For the same reason as you said. If there were five people and four died, normally the last person is the culprit"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you doubting me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I trust you. It's verification. If I don't completely understand the situation, then I can't cover it up. If you killed them then won't you please just say that you killed them? If it's corrected later, then it'll become pretty annoying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the power of the Kunagisa Syndicate is not limitless"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I didn't kill them"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really. That is not a lie"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, I didn't kill them.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't kill anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, it's just those four people.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a matter of fact, I have multiple personalities and at night, when I was supposed to be asleep, I killed those other four people. As long as the punchline in the end doesn't turn out to be like that in a stereotypical detective novel, then I didn't kill anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm" Kunagisa nodded. "Then, this time. I didn't ask you yesterday since you seemed to be really tired, but can you tell me the full story? This time, what exactly did you do in that place that boku-sama-chan doesn't know about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuum….How should I say it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From where should I begin?</p>
<p class="null-p">After hesitating for a bit, I decided to start by talking about the first of August, the first day I met Assistant Professor Kigamine. Of course I didn't remember every detail, so I cut o some parts, like about Miiko-san, the conversation with the fox masked man, or the stu that didn't matter to the story. Also, while there was absolutely no reason to, I said that Kasugai-san was living at Hime-chan's place.</p>
<p class="null-p">It took me thirty minutes to finish the story.</p>
<p class="null-p">It made me feel like it was only that.</p>
<p class="null-p">That such an a air was only thirty minutes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's ephemeral.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomo, do you have any ideas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….well, I guess I have a hypothesis."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the hypothesis?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In this case, it's usually a domino murder"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A was killed by B, and B was killed by C, and A had a set up so that C would die. So, everyone dies, that's the pattern. It's a type of mystery novel." "Hmm….there's people out there thinking about some weird stu . But, you know"</p>
<p class="null-p">Setting aside Assistant Professor Kigamine who was an ordinary person.</p>
<p class="null-p">Madoka Kuchiha's undying body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Rizumu, Rizumu the Carnival .</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Izumu, Izumu the Man Eater .</p>
<p class="null-p">And---Zigzag's disciple, Yukariki Ichihime.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I can't even imagine a single human being winning in a one on one against Hime-chan, and it doesn't even matter if you keep increasing the number of people. The String techniques she uses, It's basically developed to fight against multiple people. It's the ultimate defense technique, it's like being wrapped in a spider's web." "Hmm….. Carnival is still the Man Eater , in either case it's still</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya-kun. However, if you strike when it's Carnival on the surface, then you should be fine. Although, if that was the case then she would not have been able to survive for that long…..maybe, since they said that it was a split personality, they're able to control when one of them comes out and the other goes away to some extent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pain, or a feeling of danger is the signal. He said something like that. In regards to Assistant Professor Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan, we could just sum it up by saying that they were Izumu-kun's targets but….there's also the fact that Izumu-kun was killed and that Hime-chan, who was unrelated, was also killed---It's complicated. Or rather, it's impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about the possibility of them killing each other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They killed each other. The strong ones crushed each other."</p>
<p class="null-p">Killing each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan and----Izumu-kun?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But then the corpses would be in the same place so it doesn't work. One was in the courtyard, and the other in a room on the second floor. They're in completely di erent places."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. I was just asking" Kunagisa went hmm while nodding, as if chewing over the information, and continued. "Suicide. The person who survived the battle royale then committed sucide."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's impossible. No matter who you take, it's impossible for them to commit such a suicide."</p>
<p class="null-p">She, who had her upper body and lower body ripped in two.</p>
<p class="null-p">She, who had her head smashed and her right shoulder ripped o .</p>
<p class="null-p">She, who had her neck cut through and a hole opened in her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">She, who had lost both of her arms and had her neck twisted.</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of suicide doesn't exist.</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of accident doesn't exist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just--</p>
<p class="null-p">The image of being killed and thrown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">The image of being eaten and scattered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, it would be the crime of someone outside of the group but"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah….it may be natural to think so through the process of elimination, but that would require an outsider appearing. There was no room for an outsider to appear, in that sense it's like a stormy mountain retreat similar to Wet</p>
<p class="null-p">Crow's Feather Island, or like a lonely island similar to Shadou</p>
<p class="null-p">Kyouichirou's Research Facility."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh. What about Kasugai-chan who returned home earlier?" Kunagisa said. "Couldn't you say that Kasugai-chan was not not not not not not an outsider?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I can't tell whether that was a positive or a negative question anymore, but that's also not possible. Because that person is Kasugai-san, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa Tomo was convinced.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems it was a convincing answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's Kasugai-san, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a reason more eloquent than any elaborate logic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, even if there was an outsider…..or even if there was a secret basement in that lab and someone in addition to Kuchiha-chan had been hiding and living and living in there-----The problem is the same. They can't win against Hime-chan or Izumu-kun. It's impossible to kill those two. That's certain---"</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as it was not Aikawa Jun.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as the strongest card wasn't used.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah. In that case, the reason why only Ii-chan, being the only outsider, was able to sleep until morning would become a mystery …..Hmm. Having listened to that story, there is only one reasonable hypothesis that remains in the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A hypothesis?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Want to hear it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no…." I muddled my words. "It's fine. It doesn't concern me" "Hmm…..well, at the point where a killing name is involved, it's also quite far from boku-sama-chan's tastes….." Kunagisa said. "But, if there were a culprit in this case, then he is pretty pragmatic. You know, in mystery novels, I don't know why, but they often kill people one at a time. One by one, one by one, in order. But, If you think about it normally, it would be more e cient to do all of that at once. A one hit kill, one hit withdrawal.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's a basic on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pragmatic, huh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words…..not skewed. Evenly arranged. To put it plainly, that's what it is, but is it really, in the truest sense, definitely that ? That situation, that scene, seemed to be very far from those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was skewed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Very skewed.</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking about the meaning of the word rationality , I looked in Kunagisa's direction, and Kunagisa also stared at me. Then, after looking a bit hollow, as if she was thinking about something,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Ii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps, Ii-chan, are you feeling down? For a while there you didn't seem to be very lively"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Feeling down……" I hesitated to answer that sudden question. "...ah, I am"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…..an acquaintance died. And it was four people at once. Anyone would feel down"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's weird." Kunagisa tilted her head curiously. "Don't say that. Until now, how many people do you think have died around us? After all of that, adding four more is nothing. Don't mind it. It's okay it's okay" Nihaha, Kunagisa laughing lightly, without ill will. "In the first place, it's a weird story. The ones who died were those four, it was neither Ii-chan or boku-sama-chan who died, right? Then it doesn't matter"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doesn't…….matter"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">That may be right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa is alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa Tomo, is alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Here, talking with me like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, that's fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world hasn't changed at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It keeps flowing as it is.</p>
<p class="null-p">Destiny---is making it flow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What if you came here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What if you lived here? I said that, right? After all, there are so many empty rooms here. Come live together with boku-sama-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, it's a little hard for Ii-chan to go back to that apartment, isn't it? Even if you can hide the case, even if you can hide the truth, the reality is that you can't hide that Yukariki-chan won't come back anymore. If that happens, it'll become awkward with the rest of the people there, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right……</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not just about Aikawa-san. Nanananami too, Houkou-chan too, Moeta-kun too, Koutoumaru too….and, Miiko-san too. Everyone, everyone, everyone, liked Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">And I ruined that.</p>
<p class="null-p">….With what kind of face should I go back home with?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will get the Fiat's tires repaired and deliver it to the parking lot. Inevitably, that will also mean you will have to cut ties with Neon-chan from last time but, it can't be helped, right? Or, does Ii-chan have any attachment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Attachment….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay to say it, you know? Boku-sama-chan doesn't really mind that kind of stu , whether it's whining or complaining, I will receive it all with my big love." Kunagisa leaned forward, as if crawling on the table, moving her face toward me. "Or maybe is it that Ii-chan is more interested in living together with Kasugai-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..So you knew?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's about Ii-chan, then usually"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa laughed cheerfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her big pupils became slightly narrower.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, it doesn't really bother boku-sama-chan. No matter who you like, who you love, whoever attracts you, who you embrace, who you kiss, who you have sex with. I don't care at all about all of that, rather, I'd even support you. If Ii-chan is having fun, then it's all fine. There's no need for distortion, it's fine if Ii-chan just keeps being Ii-chan. If you became an honest person, then I would be very happy for you. After all, I'm interested in what kind of person Ii-chan will become. Ii-chan's happiness is my happiness. That's why Ii-chan is free to do and to think whatever he wants</p>
<p class="null-p">----but, just one thing"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa's pupils----</p>
<p class="null-p">Changed from blue to blue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Clearer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Purer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Ii-chan stops being mine , I will destroy the Earth. Like in the old days, the next time Ii-chan disappears from my side, at that time, there will not be a next time. If I don't have Ii-chan , then I don't want anyone else. I will destroy everything without leaving a trace. I will erase everything until not even cinders remain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….To...mo"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, ehehe, that kind of thing, you already know it so much I don't even have to say it, right? Ii-chan is clever guy, right-"</p>
<p class="null-p">She laughed cheerfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sincerely, innocently, like an innocent youth---</p>
<p class="null-p">And so it was an arrogant, mysterious laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had no other choice but to nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside whose palms did I, did my body exist-----I was painfully made aware of that again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I know. It's obvious, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. It's fine, Ii-chan is fine. Ufufu, even without doing anything, Ii-chan is the messiah, the hero. Ii-chan is an admirable person who is currently saving the world. That is incredibly lucky, right? Thanks to</p>
<p class="null-p">Ii-chan, today is peaceful again, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……that's right"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe-. Iichan. Iichan. Iichan." Seeing me nod, Kunagisa suddenly wrapped her arms around my back and hugged me. Heavily, Kunagisa's weight pressed down on me. "Ii-chan, I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah….yeah"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's fine---already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking is bothersome.</p>
<p class="null-p">Living is bothersome.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being drowned is fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you're crazy then go crazy. If you're broken, then break down. Someone who's ill shouldn't just walk down the road. Resigning myself and sinking silently is what is called being resolute. Rather than just following destiny, or rebelling against it, just be swept away---that way of life is like that of a loser.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Tomo"</p>
<p class="null-p">I said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do lewd things to me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa moved her chin and placed it on my shoulder, and then rubbed her head against my face. What face she was making, I can't even imagine it. "Is it fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...it's fine"</p>
<p class="null-p">By now, anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">By now, I didn't care about anything anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world is not filled with despair, the world is despair itself. This world is hell, what about it. Don't want and you won't get robbed. If there is a door, then turn back. Don't cry, don't laugh, that has no meaning. Both believers and nonbelievers will equally not be saved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stagnate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Settle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Drown.</p>
<p class="null-p">Make me yours.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's do it...wait, today is no good"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow I have another health check. If we do something lewd today,</p>
<p class="null-p">Nao-kun will know"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….that was it. A health check, did they find something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes" Kunagisa briefly separated from me. Briefly. Briefly. Briefly. "You know-. Here and there, it seems to be in a pinch? Well there's nothing we can do about it. For boku-sama-chan, from the start, it's like I'm forcing something to live even though it is wrong." "And…...how long do you have, Bucciarati?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it's not that sad of a story. It's fine for two or three years---I think.</p>
<p class="null-p">Depending on tomorrow's results."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…..then, we're postponing it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! Ah, but, what if it's only halfway..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No" I stood up from the chair. "Let's save the fun for later. Then, I will bring my luggage"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uni?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We will live together, right? Here, together"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Ah, is it fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean? It was you who invited me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I thought you would have more attachment. I thought that you would eventually arrive at that decision, but, it was faster than I thought. Big surprise"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will also quit university…...and here, with you, for all my life, leisurely living together with you, should be fine, right…..Fast? That's not it. With what happened this time I was made well aware"</p>
<p class="null-p">How much I was yearning for something unfitting me.</p>
<p class="null-p">How much I was a broken human.</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality I should have realised it back in May.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's stop now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't involve unrelated people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't involve the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's close.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's close myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu. If so, then let's spend all day flirting. Let's lead a life of obscenity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Boku-sama-chan and you, are we Adam and Eve?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be the kind of miniature garden that's your favorite.</p>
<p class="null-p">Superimposed, superimposed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, if it's just luggage then it's okay to send someone to go get it, you know? If Ii-chan himself went to the apartment, then it would be troublesome if you met someone, right? Then, wouldn't it be best if, you were to quietly disappear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It's already night time, so everyone should be asleep" I said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Furthermore, I have some things that I don't want people to touch"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ii-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To tell you the truth, I am relieved" Kunagisa ---along with a laugh, confessed to me. "If you spend time with a person like Jun-chan, anyone will change. Ii-chan is not an exception. I thought things like is he going to change? Because Jun-chan is a big exception. Her charisma is not half assed---it's special, yeah, maybe she's special. From the start, Ii-chan is a passive person, so you're influenced by other people quite easily. Going back five years to America, it seems like a lot of things happened there and I wondered if you would change. In fact, you did change a lot. But."</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ii-chan will never change"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ii-chan will really never change"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ii-chan will never change, forever"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa said.</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa Tomo, who rarely goes outside, didn't have any machine with mobile abilities. In other words, she didn't possess any car or bike. So, I returned to my run-down apartment by walking. Kunagisa proposed to call a taxi, but I turned her down. I don't intend on saying something pretentious like I was in the mood to walk. I simply wanted to secure some time to resolve myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Resolve.</p>
<p class="null-p">I lied to Kunagisa. About having important stu I don't want people to touch, I really don't have anything. I don't have even one important thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this world, and in myself. For this world, and for myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is not a single important thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, it is attachment.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Kunagisa was talking about, attachment.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to go back at least once to the apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Go back one more time, and see everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….saying that would also be false"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's also false.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to see anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have no intention of seeing them.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I saw them, what would I talk about?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But----that's still lingering attachment, isn't it….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Do I want to be consoled?</p>
<p class="null-p">Do I want to be insulted?</p>
<p class="null-p">Do I think I'm performing in some TV drama?</p>
<p class="null-p">That's ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is a limit on being so ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nonsense amidst nonsense…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I arrived at Senbon Nakadachiuri; it was three o'clock in the middle of the night. I wasn't wearing a watch, and my phone was still turned o , so it's just a guess.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of the entrance to the apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, I met Kasugai-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">An ambush.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, like a god of death.</p>
<p class="null-p">This person, what is she doing in the middle of the night?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh. Oh"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome home"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Kasugai-san. It's looks like you're fine"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're quite late. And, adding to that, you don't seem to be really fine .</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where is the Fiat"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We left it there"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where is Hime-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She died"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. Hmm." Kasugai-san nodded without any emotion as if it was nothing. For this person, human death, whether it be someone else or herself, she had only that much recognition for it. She reached that position, that stage, long ago. "Then I will move to the room downstairs. After all, a four tatami room is too cramped for two people to live in. That thing about taking half a tatami when you're awake and one tatami when you're asleep was a lie, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that face you're making? That face. No, no. You should stop it" Kasugai-san crossed her arms, as if confronting me. "Stop trying to make people sad, just because you can't get sad. I don't have that kind of emotion. Demanding something you can't do out of someone is unfair, and asking someone to do something they can't do is also unfair."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I guess so"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not being able to mourn someone's death is not particularly a bad thing, don't try to make it my fault. And also I should have warned you. I don't want to hear any complaints."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand….." I resisted saying most of the things I wanted to say. In reality, I didn't want to understand what Kasugai-san was saying, even though I'm sure I couldn't comprehend it anyway, but arguing with this person is essentially meaningless. "But, please let me just confirm one thing…...that unpleasant premonition you had, that was mainly about</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Correct"</p>
<p class="null-p">Correct.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected of a biologist.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that's a biologist who generally specializes in animals .</p>
<p class="null-p">"….You don't have to move to Hime-chan's room. I'm leaving."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? You'll do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, Kasugai-san was surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. That's why I came to get my things…….I'm going to Kunagisa's place. I can't face everyone else right now, and it's also something that I have been thinking for a long time"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san didn't say anything</p>
<p class="null-p">This person is that kind of person.</p>
<p class="null-p">She has no opinion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was a short relationship"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enough to be too long"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm feeling a little lonely"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows…..I wonder how it is really. Well, I'm going to the convenience store. Be sure to have left before I come back. Bye bye"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san said that without changing her expression and passed by me. Really, just with words as light as if parting for just a day, she passed my side.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't return any words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not even goodbye or farewell, not even sorry or good day, I felt that these words were not suited towards that person. But, should I have said something?</p>
<p class="null-p">Like, let's meet again if we have a connection.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did this happen?</p>
<p class="null-p">It shouldn't have been like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't something I had to think about, of course, as I had thought it over and over and over and over and over and over and over, as if just the number of times that I thought it would give me the answer. That it is my fault.</p>
<p class="null-p">The cause in cause and e ect was me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's better to not have any ties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't that what that means?</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked up at the apartment. It kinda feels…..even though it's only been two days since I haven't been back…..already, It looked as if I didn't know this place at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">A wanderer.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a bad word.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, what a bad word.</p>
<p class="null-p">While hesitating, I took a step inside. Naturally, there wasn't anything particularly special. It didn't feel any di erent from when I was walking on the asphalt earlier. It didn't change.</p>
<p class="null-p">I haven't changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't need Kunagisa to tell me that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's give up, already. Let's stop, already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't it pathetic for a weak person to just move their feet?.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't it unsightly to see a loser struggle?.</p>
<p class="null-p">Know yourself.</p>
<p class="null-p">An inexperienced person shouldn't make merry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't go forward while lacking the capabilities.</p>
<p class="null-p">Withdraw.</p>
<p class="null-p">A corpse shouldn't act like a living person.</p>
<p class="null-p">There will be things to lose, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's admit it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have lost long ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not just with mere words, let's admit it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good I'm no good"</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly no good.</p>
<p class="null-p">Climbing the stairs, I went into my room.</p>
<p class="null-p">I need to get….a change of clothes, my passport, and…..my insurance card. My books…..I guess it's fine to leave them. I still have books to read piled up at Kunagisa's place. Then, everything that I'm taking should fit in a gym bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">I unlocked the door and entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned on the lights.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san, was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her black jinbei melted into the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">She noticed me entering the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Welcome home…….I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't say 'I'm back'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Please don't act as if you can see through me." I ignored her and walked towards the closet. Alright, I think I left the passport around here somewhere……. "And also, please don't enter into other people's rooms without their permission." "I was worried about you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Worried? …..that's unnecessary"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…….where's Hime?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shut up.</p>
<p class="null-p">You're irritating.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why should I have to explain everything?</p>
<p class="null-p">It has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan too.</p>
<p class="null-p">You too.</p>
<p class="null-p">So stop running your mouth even though it doesn't concern you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She died."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san nodded normally.</p>
<p class="null-p">She took out a metal fan from her pocket and opened it with a bam .</p>
<p class="null-p">"And"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though Hime-chan died, why are you still alive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Because even if Hime-chan dies, I don't die. Because, it doesn't concern me----"</p>
<p class="null-p">With nearly no sound, with nearly no opening.</p>
<p class="null-p">The iron fan hit my cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">A shock as if I had been hit by lightning ran through my cheeks. I was sent flying away from the closet. I hit the wall with my shoulder. And, with quite the force, I hit my head. It hurt. The pain in my cheeks continued to hurt. The wound Izumu-kun inflicted on me must have opened. Even though it was finally about to heal…..</p>
<p class="null-p">It hurts.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was that for?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can tell from your expression that something has happened, but I don't know what it was." Miiko-san said flatly. "I'm not even really interested. However, answer my question. Why are you here, and where are you planning to go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...I'm running away. Because it's scary"</p>
<p class="null-p">Am I running away?</p>
<p class="null-p">Am I scared?</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's scary, so I will run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm only doing what's obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not my fault. Don't get angry at me. Don't blame me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also don't want to cause any trouble….. extraordinary losers stay with the losers, the grotesque should stay with the grotesque ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm---grotesque, huh?" Miiko-san crouched down to my eye level as I still sat there. "Inoji. To me, crying when you're sad, getting angry when something bad happens, laughing when something fun happens, being happy when you fall in love, fighting those that you hate, feeling lonely when you're alone, and getting along with others isn't what makes someone human."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You call yourself a defective product, but I don't think--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I---</p>
<p class="null-p">Without understanding why, I screamed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't talk like you know me! Don't look down on me! Why are you pitying me, am I that pathetic?! You don't even know anything about me! It shouldn't have been like that, it's weird! It shouldn't have been like that, it doesn't make sense even to me! I don't know why it became like this! But, it happened and there's nothing I can do! I don't even care anymore! It's not like it's the first time! Until now, how many people, how many people, how many people, how many dozens, how many hundreds, how many thousands, died because of me?! After all that, even if one or two or three or four people die, I don't feel anything!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violently, I grabbed Miiko-san's collar.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to tear her apart like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to tear her up into pieces, and destroy her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was being controlled by anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was I mad at Miiko-san telling me that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not because Hime-chan died.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not because Hime-chan died.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the first place, I thought that Hime-chan was annoying because she was always clinging to me! I smiled at her by chance, but somehow she got the idea that we were friends! I always thought she was an impertinent and selfish brat! I feel refreshed now that she's gone, I don't care about her anymore!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miiko-san, you too! You too, always, always, talking like you know it all! If you truly understood my feelings, then don't say something so insensitive! Don't pretend like you trust me! Every time I hear those enlightened words of yours, I get annoyed! What's with the older sister act, do you think I'll be grateful!? You act so nice, but what exactly have you done for me! Don't say there's hope for someone who's in despair! Are you going to take responsibility for giving me hope?! That kind of thing is disgusting! It's disgusting, like walking on cardboard with socks on! A failure will always be a failure, and so as long as they don't have any hope, then fall into any further despair, why won't you let me give up, isn't it fine already!?" I spat it out</p>
<p class="null-p">I spat out everything that I had been holding back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's people like you that I hate the most!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I had an urge to laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, it was just that.</p>
<p class="null-p">A bond between two people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Connections.</p>
<p class="null-p">Consideration. Kindness. Compassion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wanting to help, wanting to protect.</p>
<p class="null-p">Trusting. Counting on others.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">Clinging to others like that is foolish.</p>
<p class="null-p">It ruins the mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">It spoils everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though people can only live alone. Even though there is no human relationship without betrayal. Where is the person who won't betray someone when he puts his mind into it? That person doesn't exist. Everyone betrays someone, everyone gets betrayed by someone, and they still all just trust each other until the end. That's all. They all betray someone in the end. Betray.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I just need to betray them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Trusting someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Trusting myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to do that, I really did.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I couldn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't say unreasonable things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Can't you see that I did my best?</p>
<p class="null-p">Can't you see that I managed to get here by doing my best?</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, please just let give up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, you should praise me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I won't be able to do it again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Never again for all eternity.</p>
<p class="null-p">So just praise me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't this enough already?</p>
<p class="null-p">This is who I am.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hate me, despise me, ridicule me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't care what you say to me, I will accept any insults. I'm a pathetic guy who deserves all kinds of slander. I don't care about anyone. I've destroyed everything that I cared about. Nobody who's been by my side has ever been happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nobody can exist by my side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine already, just leave me alone, it's only irritating when you worry about me! Even you must be fed up with pain in the ass like me, right!? It'd feel nice to cut ties with an idiot like me, right!? You actually hate me and despise me too, right!? Then please just let me go---"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inoji"</p>
<p class="null-p">She firmly gripped my face.</p>
<p class="null-p">And shoved me into the wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">The whole apartment creaked, and it felt like the wall was going to break.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of the air was forced out of my lungs, and I was out of breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't say anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't-----say anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me how I feel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can say whatever you want about me, you can think whatever you want about me, but don't order me with your assumptions. …..Just what are you getting mad at?" "Uuuuh….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She held my face firmly so I couldn't look away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san brought her face close.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes were sharp.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stop looking at me with those eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I truly don't like getting involved with other people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why does nobody understand?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up…...please. Just stop…..already, please. Please forgive me….. I'm sorry….please forgive me….." While exhaling, I forced the words out weakly. "I…...said it, right? Did I ask for your pity? Did I say I wanted to get along with you? It's fine already. It's already too late for me. It's all----it's all too late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san--</p>
<p class="null-p">She let go of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regrets were piling up in my chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was disappointed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was thrown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">No.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hate this.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hate being looked down on.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I hate being abandoned even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being thought of like that by this person---</p>
<p class="null-p">By Miiko-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, you're already no good"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san closed her iron fan with a bam .</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, you truly are worthless"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But having it be told by someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told that by you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A guy who can't even protect one girl, who didn't even try to protect her and just make excuses, doesn't deserve to live. Someone who just wallows in his incompetence doesn't deserve to live."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she took something out of her fan.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a hidden knife.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like a kogatana, but from the shape, it was closer to a shuriken.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Don't you want to die?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were always saying things about how there's no meaning to life. You've always been saying pessimistic things like that, haven't you? So then,</p>
<p class="null-p">I will kill you.</p>
<p class="null-p">You won't need to live pointlessly anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…thats"</p>
<p class="null-p">No, isn't she right?</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be as she says.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, what am I doing living pointlessly like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't need to, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no need to draw out my life.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she's gonna kill me, then I might as well get killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh. So that was it. I didn't want to be consoled, and I didn't want to be blamed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to be killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The responsibility for having given you hope----I'll be taking it now. Ah, well you know. Killing Inoji after finally getting along with you will be hard for me, but that just means your su ering and mine will be equal"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah…..</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't move.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I'm not afraid.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't it fine like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it fine?</p>
<p class="null-p">Did I get something wrong?</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, just a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"One"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hyun ----Miiko-san her right arm sharply through the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">The knife became a blur.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, I'm dead, I thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I thought that-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Two"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san's movement didn't end.</p>
<p class="null-p">The blade moved back and then moved back and forth, repeatedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Three, four, five, six"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time the blade ran through----</p>
<p class="null-p">My right cheek was cut.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as I thought that the movement had finally stopped, all of the cuts opened at once. An extraordinary amount of blood came pouring out of those six cuts but----Miiko-san sheathed her small blade, put her palms on my cheeks, and, softly, gently, pushed to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There. Like that, you've now died six times"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't speak through the pain in my cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though my mouth should have been closed, I could taste blood. It seems that some of those cuts went through my cheek. The taste of my blood was awful as expected. Awful. It's the first time I have ever tasted such awful blood. It tasted of iron. But, the color of the covering Miiko-san's hands was neither green nor purple, it was red.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't blue either.</p>
<p class="null-p">A bright red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now you've been reborn six times at once----so if you say some stupid stu again, then you truly are no good. I will really kill you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what will you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm not sure." I answered while repressing the pain in my cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But----Someone like me, what are you saying I can do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the very least, you can do more than me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san said straightforwardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm incompetent. All I'm good at is swinging a sword. But what about you? You have a lot you can do, right? You---you just haven't been doing the things you can do, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Just not doing them…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're sad, aren't you?" Miiko-san said quietly. "You're sad that…….Hime isn't here anymore, right? Then just say so. Why are you blaming yourself and screaming at me? That's not what you need to be doing right now, is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sad?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is that so?</p>
<p class="null-p">Am I------sad that Hime-chan died.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is…...correct."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said.</p>
<p class="null-p">It confessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was almost my last words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just that, Miiko-san, I…….until now, I have hurt many people. I have made many miserable, I have made many through painful experiences, and I have neglected many people. Hime-chan was just another victim of that. At this point, for me…..for me to grieve someone's death…...I've already forgotten how many I hurt, how many I tricked, how many I deceived, how many I cheated. I've never counted how many I betrayed, how many I used, how many I sold out. I responded to a ection with contempt, and responded to love with hatred. I've never trusted anybody, and I only saw those who trusted in me as liars. No matter what anyone said to me and no matter what I said to anyone, I was completely una ected. I never thought that someone could ever love me unconditionally. I an irreparable defective product, it's already been too late for me since way back, so that's why, at this point, at for me to feel something like sadness would just be---"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's enough!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san shouted, and grabbed my neck and lifted me up in the blink of an eye. I couldn't reach the floor with my feet, my trachea was completely closed, and I really couldn't breathe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you think that childish nonsense will get through to me?! Do you think the words of someone who has never had an honest conversation with anyone will echo in anyone's heart! It must be nice to decide that you can't do anything and act depressed! Try imagining what it's like for me to watch you! Why can't you tell that you won't get anywhere like that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miiko, san---"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care if you're miserable or you're struggling, just do something! Even if it's pathetic, it's far better than doing nothing! Struggle, wriggle, that's fine! Everyone lives while deceiving themselves like that! Don't choose an unfair way of life where you are the only one su ering!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san glared at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were traces of tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as she yelled, her voice choked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen up! No matter how many you hurt, how many you've tricked, how many you've deceived, how many you've disrespected, how many you've betrayed, how many you've used, or how many you've sold out! No matter how many you've hurt, or how many you have made miserable! Even if you're a fool, even if you're unsightly! Even if it's too late, even if it's past the point of no return! Even if you're a defective product who can't trust anyone, or a human failure that murder people!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Why would something like that mean that you can't feel sadness?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something----It felt like something had fell.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly I felt my body becoming light. Everything that I had been obsessed with until now, everything that had restrained me, now felt like it was a thin, brittle cage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who had been restraining me? Who held the key to these shackles?</p>
<p class="null-p">"----You liked Ichihime, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was fun having her around, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to her, you were happy, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I---</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded with conviction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was always cheerful like an idiot.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was selfish, and cried a lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was easy to fool, but a liar.</p>
<p class="null-p">She easily mixed up her words, and was bad at studying.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she was very hard working, and was always doing her best.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was an incredible girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">These past two months.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were fun because Hime-chan was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why didn't I notice that until now?</p>
<p class="null-p">That I was so blessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I was so happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Remember it. Remember it all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan's words, Hime-chan's appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every one of her hairs---</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't forget her even if I tried. It would be so much easier for me to forget her but, even then, I couldn't. How could I have forgotten that even though it was so much fun?</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to shout it out, even now I want to go and tell her, with all my heart. That if only for a short while, you've managed to bring joy to a single hopeless person, to someone who had no happiness in his life.</p>
<p class="null-p">And not just to only me.</p>
<p class="null-p">To Miiko-san and everyone else too.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sure to Aikawa-san too.</p>
<p class="null-p">For what purpose was I born?</p>
<p class="null-p">With what meaning was I born?</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least--------not to feel like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was to feel like this, then I would rather have not been born. If it was for this pathetic feeling, for the feeling like it would be far better to just die, I would rather not have been born.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what I had thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't have any intention to take it back.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no way I can take it back.</p>
<p class="null-p">I came to think that everything was a mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">I came to think that living itself was a mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">I came to think that everything was a failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">I came to think that not dying was a failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, why is it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, why is it?</p>
<p class="null-p">That I still wouldn't wish that I never knew Hime-chan--</p>
<p class="null-p">"I---"</p>
<p class="null-p">I said with the taste of blood in my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fact that Hime-chan, I…...really hate it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sad that Hime-chan died."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…..that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san let go of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a thump, I landed on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ground was stable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sad too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Miiko-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">I touched my cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was wet and sticky with blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I….have found something to do"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something I have to do"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san gave a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll be back, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes...but I don't when that will be."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't bother me. You can come back home whenever you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san said boldly. "That's because this place is your home, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"----That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">I forcefully wiped the blood o my cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though, my clothes were already soaked in blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it suits me.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the beginning, I've been living as if I was already dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just living, but as if I was dying.</p>
<p class="null-p">So I'll struggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll struggle pathetically.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is hell in front of me, but there is also hell behind me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's turn back time and repeat.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll continue living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like I'm dying, like I'm already dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't care about what anyone else thinks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, I'm be going now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Be careful"</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked back before leaving.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san crossed her arms as she watched me go.</p>
<p class="null-p">You could see she was faintly smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right---.</p>
<p class="null-p">I love her smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miiko-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I come back, I will probably confess to you, so please think about an answer"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Confess? ….What do you like me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes...about as much as Miiko-san likes me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….That's interesting. That's real interesting, Inoji" Miiko-san said back to me without any hesitation. "Then I'll be waiting here for you to return" "Yeah…..you then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if we don't have a connection, let's meet again.</p>
<p class="null-p">I waved my hand, left the room, climbed down the stairs, and left the apartment. The night air cooled down the wound on my cheek. It was the perfect summertime temperature for Kyoto.</p>
<p class="null-p">The blood didn't stop flowing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Red, red, red, red.</p>
<p class="null-p">My brain felt clear. It felt like there was nothing that I couldn't see even in that darkness. I could even di erentiate between the cries of the bats in the sky. My nerves were so sensitive that I could even distinguish the feeling of the wind hitting against my skin. Everything was released.</p>
<p class="null-p">My everything was released.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly----</p>
<p class="null-p">Exhilarating.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly, clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly-----a masterpiece.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, let's get psyched up and------let's go kill, dismember,gather it up, line it up and expose it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I headed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Climbing a long way up from Kamogawa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Beyond to the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the lab of Assistant Professor Kigamine.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/zaregoto/illustrations/zaregoto_vol_06_15.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">0</p>
<p class="null-p">He had everything she didn't have, and he didn't have anything she had.</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">I collapsed three meters away from the apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was from anemia.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was from blood loss.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san who was passing by (returning from the convenience store. She had bags packed with beer in both of her hands. A hopeless adult.) helped me, then she and Houko-chan (Kasugai-san woke her up from her sleep. Good job), both treated me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Are you an idiot?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan's first words to me when I woke up were harsh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The front of the apartment now looks like a crime scene. The stairs and the hallway too. It's becoming more and more like a haunted house"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not something that can be resolved by apologizing. Anyway, if you're gonna head somewhere, wait until the night finishes. The cuts are sharp so there's no need to stitch them, by that time your body will have recovered"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you….for that, Houko-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no. You're welcome"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ikki. You should also thank me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was too bothersome to retort, so I once again thanked Kasugai-san. Then, once morning came, with the top and bottom of my right cheek fixed with gauze that was firmly sandwiched between my eye, I first searched my room. Obviously, I wasn't searching for my passport and insurance card. Well then, where did I put it again? After leaving it for about a month, I don't really remember where I put it…..ah, that's right. It's behind the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kasugai-san, could you please become a chair for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..lewd."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So obscene."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said that's wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, even though Kasugai-san is taller than me, asking a woman to become a chair goes against societal norms if I think about it. I don't have enough free time on my hands to preach about the Gender Equality in Employment Act. I gave Kasugai-san a ride on my shoulders (again, that's a pretty bad way to put it), and I made her take the object that I wanted from behind the ceiling. "Oh. This is….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was two knives and a pistol.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of the knives was for lock-opening and had weak killing power. So rather than a knife, it's trait as an Anti lock blade was stronger. The other one, the one I received from Aikawa Jun, was terribly rugged, but surprisingly thin, like a scalpel for medicinal use, it had the appearance of a pocket knife. Then the gun---it was a Jericho 941. There was no need to explain that. The cartridge was 41AE, and only three bullets were left.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's nostalgic."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san said while gazing at that. I see, now that I think about it, in last month's case, she basically faced me alone while I had these three equipped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the equipment we had when we both took down that detestable</p>
<p class="null-p">Shadou Kyouichirou, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't fabricate false memories."</p>
<p class="null-p">After having checked the bullet count and the state of the pistol, I packed it in my gym bag. For the knives, one (the pocket knife) will be in the holster on my upper body, the other (the anti lock blade), after thinking about it, I decided to put it together with the gun. After resting for a bit, there was no need to worry about anemia, but in the one in a million chance that I were to fall over and stab my hip, that would be a problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'm o ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. By the way, you won't go see Miiko-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san was constantly waiting for me since Kasugai-san came back alone from that research lab, so it seems she was lacking in sleep and rest and, after talking to me, she went to sleep soundly in her room next door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I saw her now, I would look too uncool…...more importantly,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san. I have a request"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you first met Rizumu-chan, you stole that business car, right? Do you still have it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I threw it away"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">This person is the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I remember it's contents. Want me to write it down?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected from a science person…..I would personally be thankful if you did that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want I can also go along with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it will be easier to move alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kasugai-san said indi erently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Ikki. How should I say it…. Won't it be bad if you went looking like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">" What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well I don't think many people would remember a man as plain as you, but it would be bad if someone near that place remembered you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true." I had a feeling I was being insulted, but you could certainly say that. "Then just in case, it would be better to disguise myself. A disguise, huh…..what should I do. I cut my hair, so I can't crossdress without a wig…" "Now that I said it, I feel like the gauze on your face is enough. But it would be a problem if that attracted too much attention. At least change yourself and put on a hat. Then Ikki, in regards to that, be careful on the way and also when you arrive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I count on you to bring back gifts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There won't be any."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I put the bag on my back, left the apartment, headed to the parking lot, put on the helmet----</p>
<p class="null-p">Two hours later.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant professor Kigamine's research lab.</p>
<p class="null-p">I arrived at the former Saitou Clinic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I parked the Vespa in the parking lot, I realized that the Fiat, Katana and the Z were no longer here. Was it removed as evidence during the cover up operation? Impossible, that would be cruel. It's fine for the Fiat and the Katana, but the Z is a pretty old model so there is a possibility that it will stay in the garage forever. Setting the Katana apart as it is not mine, the Fiat is a problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…."</p>
<p class="null-p">While I thought, I went around the building to the courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was beautiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no puddle of blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan's body was also not there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">I had resolved myself, but it threw o my rhythm.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that the disposal , the cover up, was completed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the time I contacted Kunagisa…...um, my sense of time is a bit o …. but it should have been the morning before yesterday, so in the 48 hours since the Kunagisa Syndicate started to move it was enough time for them to finish.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that is wonderful.</p>
<p class="null-p">It can disappear without any trace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's as if…."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was about to say it, but I stopped. There's no way I can say that. It's as if Hime-chan hadn't been alive in the first place, I won't say that kind of thing even if my mouth was split open.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the smell of blood had disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….It's nonsense."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if making a circle around the building, I went around to the entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sliding door was locked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Good grief."</p>
<p class="null-p">I took out the door opening knife from my bag and used it. After about five second, I unlocked it. I opened the door and entered inside. There were shoes. Kuchiha-chan's shoes. Only that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for the intrusion" I said without any meaning. "Well then, I will just enter."</p>
<p class="null-p">First…..where to?</p>
<p class="null-p">I think it was the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked down the hallway while being quiet and alert------However, the signs of people being here had been completely erased. It has been eradicated. In the first place, Kuchiha-chan was living here alone, so it's unavoidable that there would be few presences-------but for the most part this was a result of the cleaning . The door to the laboratory which I had broken that I passed on the way had been neatly replaced. Then, when I arrived at the door of the library----as expected, it was locked. Again, I opened it using the knife.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no one inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine was not reading a book.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor Kigamine's shoulder was not torn o .</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..there wasn't really any meaning to come here."</p>
<p class="null-p">If it's all tidy and clean like that, there won't be any evidence or anything like an on-site inspection. Well, the idea was for it to be a sort of ritual to get inspiration, which might have ended up being ine ective…..but this is overkill.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I was the one who asked for the cover up.</p>
<p class="null-p">However…..setting Kuchiha-chan aside, Assistant Professor Kigamine is what Mikoko-chan called a famous person . I wonder how the information was falsified? I don't know since I don't read the newspaper or watch TV.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though, it may all be over already.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's fine, I will start over and over any number of times.</p>
<p class="null-p">Continuing from there, I went to the changing room in order to take a look at the shower room. There was no lock here. I opened the door and went inside. The door behind it had a simple lock, but it was a lock that couldn't be used if there was no one inside, so there was no need to worry about the lock.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was about to turn the knob, I hesitated a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who won't die.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who won't die .</p>
<p class="null-p">What does it mean to not die?</p>
<p class="null-p">Undying, immortal.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, was she truly---dead?</p>
<p class="null-p">That possibility.</p>
<p class="null-p">If, at that time she was alive --</p>
<p class="null-p">If she was alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….It's not something that I can do anything about though, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I shook o that ridiculous delusion and opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her corpse, which should have had it's upper and lower half separated was----</p>
<p class="null-p">Not there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----well, she's dead"</p>
<p class="null-p">About her circumstances, Kunagisa told me everything without hiding anything, so her corpse that was recovered by the Kunagisa Syndicate will surely continue to be experimented on.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a poor soul.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, is it a poor soul?</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of thing---everything after you die, and everything after that, is nothing more than a selfish feeling. Am I just thinking that because I wasn't that close to Kuchiha-chan?</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Obviously, there weren't enough words between me and Kuchiha-chan for me to feel something more for her. I should have spoken much more with</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan about various things.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't have much time.</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any other way to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">I closed the door and left the changing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next is the second floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Going back to the hallway, I climbed the stairs up to the second floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hospital room near the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Rizumu, Niounomiya Izumu.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Niounomiya siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">I opened the door and went inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, it was completely clean inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no beheaded corpse with a hole in its chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm beaten…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Was here no meaning to having come all this way?</p>
<p class="null-p">I left the room and went to the hospital room next door. That is to say the room where Hime-chan and I had passed a night in. Nobody was killed in this room, so you could say there was no reason to see it.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I entered inside, of course, it was as we left it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't tell if it was cleaned…….ah, no, it seems it was cleaned. The bed was back as it was. It didn't have the form of Hime-chan made by a futon inside a futon, it was cleanly made. A clean white sheet was spread out without even one wrinkle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Which reminds me….. that , what was that?</p>
<p class="null-p">When I woke up, I mistook that for Hime-chan. It is clear that at that point Hime-chan was already not here. However….however, what about when I came back to my room at night? At that time, was it Hime-chan that I saw? If you asked me whether she was deep into the futon, I wouldn't know how to answer. But, even if I didn't see her, there is no guarantee that</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan was not there at the time……</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guarantee, huh…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I laid down on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I closed my eyes for a bit and thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, it was closer to remembering than to think.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did Hime-chan do that? Maybe it wasn't Hime-chan…….and another person did it…..so that I wouldn't notice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But why?</p>
<p class="null-p">For someone to do something that flashy just to hide it from me …….more than not understanding the meaning behind it, it's just eerie.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was one of the things that was on my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">But there was also one more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Clearly something even more out of place in comparison to the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unnatural, supernatural.</p>
<p class="null-p">" At that time, that cannibal…..which person was it ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of the night, after taking a shower and talking with Assistant</p>
<p class="null-p">Professor Kigamine, we passed each other by the stairs. Was that actually</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun, or Rizumu-chan, or……. was it neither of them ?</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed empty.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like zero.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But….they didn't say anything about having a third personality. Neither</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan, nor Izumu-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">No, wait.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having a third one that no one knows about, would that be unthinkable? After all, Rizumu-chan perceived the person that is Izumu-kun as someone else . By the same logic, that would mean that if there was a third person…..if there was a third person that neither Rizumu-chan or Izumu-kun knew about, then that would not be weird, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">"………...Hmm"</p>
<p class="null-p">…….That was just an idea, but was it an unlikely one? If you thought there was someone with two personalities, but it turns out to be someone with three personalities. The existence of the third personality no one knows about, setting the great detective aside, would that not work out to be as much of a threat as the professional killer ?</p>
<p class="null-p">Wouldn't that be a useful trick?</p>
<p class="null-p">No…….even then, there's still Shiogi-chan's information. That Shiogi-chan of a thousand forms, having fought a thousand battles, it's hard to think that she would be fooled by a trick of that level….. something like fooling your allies before your enemies, in regards to that girl, it would be like preaching philosophy to Confucius.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, that third personality, let's name him Hizumu-kun, if he existed, what would that change? That would not change anything, would it? No matter how many personalities you have, in the end there's only one body, and it can only do one thing. It's not like it had four or six arms. The trick of having multiple personalities and expanding them would work for the professional killer , but for the case in itself, there doesn't seem to be much necessity to think about it. That means, it's a problem….</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, there was a dead end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Before Aikawa-san finds out……..she said I only had three days…..um….It's a little confusing from when it is three days, but I guess it would be the day after tomorrow"</p>
<p class="null-p">If possible, I would like to get this over with before that.</p>
<p class="null-p">To tell the truth, the best idea would be for me to contact her…….but to be honest, I don't think I'd be able to face her. But, after subtracting that sense of self-preservation from the equation, it doesn't mean absolutely nothing is left. Hypothetically, if I made Aikawa-san show up, then at once, thoroughly and completely, without leaving a single blade of grass, this case would be concluded .</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to avoid that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I at least want to do something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe that's just my ego.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know what Hime-chan wishes for. Wanting to know what a dead person is thinking, that would be ego. Furthermore, using a dead person as an excuse is even worse. Ego is not good.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not good but.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to do whatever I can. Hmm, those words smell a lot like excuses……" And.</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard a sound then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without raising my body up from the bed----all at once, a signal ran through my body. That sound…...what was that? Was it the sound of the entrance opening? I made my nerves that had become too sensitive work to their maximum. The sound. The sound. Locate the sound, focus.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kishi…...kishi…...kishi…...kishi…...kishi……</p>
<p class="null-p">The hallway----is it walking though it? The sound stopped. As I thought that, I heard the sound of the sliding door opening. There was no sound of it closing, and the sound of doors opening somewhere continued at an interval.</p>
<p class="null-p">…….Is it inspecting the rooms?</p>
<p class="null-p">A person from the Kunagisa Syndicate? Impossible, no matter how you look at it, all of the cleaning should have been completely finished. And before coming here, I received information from Kunagisa. If there was any movement, then at that time Kunagisa should have told me that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gishi-</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard a sound of stepping on the stairs, gishi- gishi- gishi- gishi- , the sound continued. It was climbing up to the second floor. At that point, as one would expect, I rose and got o the bed. I took out the knife from its holster.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the neighbouring door opening.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it checking in order?</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of it closing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next…...it will come here.</p>
<p class="null-p">I prepared the knife. There was no time to take out the gun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">I waited for the door to open.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----------------Pon"</p>
<p class="null-p">It opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing there was the man with the fox mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">A fox mask, and white clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You…..have we met somewhere?" The man with the fox mask twisted his head vaguely. "Hmm. No, I see. The vespa outside…...I thought I had seen it somewhere, now that I think about it, it has the same license plate"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……You"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'You', hmm" The man with the fox mask moved his mask and showed me his real face. His face closely resembled that of a certain person I knew, with that face and those eyes, he looked at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For our ties to reunite in a place like that, very fascinating. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. I--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now put down that dangerous thing"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Yes……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kukkukku"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fox masked man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Laughed as if he were committing a crime.</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">After moving from the hospital room to the waiting room, the fox masked man and I faced each other at the low table while sitting on a cushion. I made some tea in the kitchen and served it. The man with the fox mask took his mask o and sipped at the tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rizumu and Izumu weren't coming back, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh….now that you mention it…..they said that they were currently in your care."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyoto isn't exactly my home town either. It was just a part of my roots…..and I had asked Rizumu to do a job. Regarding here , Kigamine…….the</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant Professor, I had her conduct her research in this place---you see"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, she didn't come back. That probably means that something probably happened here , so I went to see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With that Porsche, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I'm not particular about it, but it's an old favorite."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um….Mister Fox, you knew about Izumu-kun, right? Rizumu from the Niounomiya and Izumu from the Niounomiya…….about the front and back union theory."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Front and back theory'. Hmm. That's a nice expression. It's like you're familiar with it" The fox masked man said. "Well, roughly yes. If you ask whether I know it or not, then I know it. Otherwise, I wouldn't raise someone like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Originally I didn't want to come to such a rural area, but it seems like there was apparently a cover up. The fact that Rizumu came here and vanished. That would mean that talking from afar wouldn't do much. That's why as you can see, I came here but----earlier you said 'they said' right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to know something."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with a fox mask said with a confident tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..something…..even if you say that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though the Kunagisa Syndicate did a cover up-----even if they were still in the middle of it------for this man to appear in this way at the scene, it's strange. I have been thinking about that since a moment ago. To begin with, a cover up operation is meant to make it feel like there wasn't a cover up----and yet how did the fox masked man notice it?</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder how.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's unnatural.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">If there were a possibility…..it would be that this man is located outside of the political power of the Kunagisa organization---</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a deduction made me nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Watch out, don't let your guard down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, it made me think this mustn't be missed .</p>
<p class="null-p">There might be some hints.</p>
<p class="null-p">This man was the employer of the Niounomiya siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…..when you sent Rizumu-chan and Izumu-kun, I was also there. For an aptitude test for a part-time job….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before talking about that, one thing." The fox masked man urged me, but I opened my mouth while being cautious. "Is it fine if I say speculation that came to my mind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are…….the head of this place when it was a clinic, Saitou-san, is that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Ho" The fox masked man, put on the mask he had set aside. "Did you hear that from those two ? Though I wonder why do you think that, let's hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's close to guesswork…..I just guessed it from the Assistant Professor</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine's and Kuchiha-chan's story, and also from Izumu-kun's story. Also, the reaction you had when you heard Assistant Professor Kigamine's name last time…...and finally, the orders you issued to Rizumu-kun and Izumu-chan. What was hidden behind 'investigate this lab' and 'kill Kigamine Yaku and Madoka Kuchiha'. That's about all of the ingredients for that deduction."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I swear every one of them has a loose tongue….." The fox masked man said as if he was fed up. "Especially the Niounomiya siblings. They were useful, but…..they were both too high energy. However, there are also those that are too cool…..especially if the cool side is just a thin mask that is hiding a hot nature on the inside…..now that I think about it, Junya was a good example of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Junya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. No, sorry, it's the name of an old friend. That person is quite gloomy but also strangely passionate. Really, it was out of hand…..hmm. Well, you should also keep yourself in mind. Anyway, it's just that it's easier to use guys that are easy to follow. Of course, as an absolute condition, they would need to be clever enough or else it would be a problem. You can't just use an idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, the question you asked earlier…...I can only answer yes to half of the meaning. Saying no too, would also only be half correct. That's because I am truly that Saitou-san .</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were surprised, huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">While shrugging his shoulders,the fox masked man made a movement as if he were playing the fool.</p>
<p class="null-p">And continuing, he turned and looked around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This place doesn't change, huh…….It's as if time had stopped flowing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing has changed from twenty years ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Twenty years….."</p>
<p class="null-p">That is probably the result of Kuchiha-chan's feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">She has always, for all of these last two decades, taken care of this place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting this place remain stagnant, just like with her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">For what purpose?</p>
<p class="null-p">That is, surely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At that time, I was almost twenty years old. I was a professor in some impressive university…..it was such a colorful job that it makes me laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a star attraction."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I know of someone who dropped out at elementary school, so at this point I'm not surprised by a twenty year old professor, however, that man went to become Saitou …….Assistant Professor Kigamine's master, and also Kuchiha-chan's Mentor , I didn't think about that at all. It's completely unexpected.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, I had lost my words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, the fox masked man continued eloquently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For me, the job of a professor was a side thing, and the clinic I opened here was going to be the main thing.-----but society's evaluation of that was lukewarm. Misunderstandings and misinterpretations couldn't be avoided where I went. Setting that aside, Kigamine…..Yaku. And Madoka Kuchiha. That's nostalgic…..until you made me hear that name again last time, I had completely forgotten about it. I didn't think they were still confined in this place continuing after me ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...those two, they were waiting for you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though they didn't say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even then, they were waiting for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">For someone. For something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Crazily, lovingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's nothing I could have done. I had completely forgotten about them." The fox masked man said candidly. "Well, there's also something wrong with me-----I should have remembered just with 'Kyoto'. Now that I think about it, the source of what I am now was that girl who cannot die ------humans can forget where they came from. That's a surprise." "….Setting aside the fact you had forgotten" I said. "If you are Saitou-san, then all the more, why try to to kill those two? Why do that----why did you employ Izumu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a misunderstanding, it's a misleading statement. I didn't really try to kill them…..because it's like they were already dead twenty years ago. If they had failed to die, then it was just to finish them.…...or at least I was asking for that kind of nuance…… I said it earlier, didn't I? I'm cleaning up the things from when I was still young and inexperienced. The responsibility for having given them hope-----I need to take it. Well, saying those things to Izumu won't get through to him. That guy only listens to about half of half of half of what anyone is saying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Izumu-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why he needs to follow Rizumu. That Izumu, it's already too late for a conventional weapon to counter that mayhem. It's not a story of one against a thousand, if you know how to use him, he's a berserker who could win a war alone. Did you hear about the reason for why both of his arms are restrained?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, if he doesn't do that he won't be able to control himself, I heard a story like that but…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Niounomiya's Izumu, the Man Eater , his heirloom's treasured sword, he has a one hit sure kill technique called Eating One …...that's an inhuman technique where he uses the rms he normally seals. Honestly, even when I saw it happen in front of me, I was shaken. You could say he is the best masterpiece out of all of Niounomiya's history…….although, that would be in a few years, however. To be called the best masterpiece, he still lacks some history and achievements….furthermore, even at that time, following</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu is essential."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rizumu-chan…..her body…..it's weird to put it like this, but when she becomes like that, isn't it dangerous for her? You say follow, but on her side, she has no combat abilities, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..You don't understand. What I think is scarier is Rizumu rather than Izumu. Killing such a baby-like kid…….such a weak kid, to kill such a cute and small kid like that is an unbearable act, more than you think. The guilt of killing a weakling that's not even an enemy, killing something that has the form of a human, you know what I mean, right? In reality even you, unintentionally, probably 'out of character', saved Rizumu-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the strength of weakness…..being strong is weak, and being weak is strong. Didn't Izumu say something like that? Even as a detective, it's not like she didn't have any skill…...but, more accurately, Rizumu was Izumu's defensive form . In a physical sense…..and also in a psychological sense." "…..But, then, Rizumu-chan----she was too miserable. No, it might be weird to say miserable for an artificially created personality, but-----" "Miserable, huh----you're a relatively quick witted fellow, but you don't seem to understand the most important point……" The fox masked man's tone seemed to be ridiculing me for my miscomprehension. "About the Niounomiya siblings, about the Niounomiya siblings' assassination techniques, Izumu and Rizumu, which one do you think is the back , which do you think is the Master ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's--------Izumu-kun, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You fool."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was flatly rejected with a good amount of emotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask continued to mock me and laughed</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kukkukku."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though Izumu and Rizumu were personalities that were created artificially, representing strength and weakness respectively----the time they act as a killer is only a fraction overall. They're not serial killers, so they are not working around the clock, spending 24 hours a day killing people. In other words, the time the Man Eater spends at the front is only an hour. Based on the general public's view, that's only a small amount. The shadow is rather at the back , on Izumu's side"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For the Niounomiya siblings, the time spent as the Carnival is far greater. I'm not saying that time is everything, but if you're talking about front and back, each one of them can be either"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..A pair as one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"One as a pair. The Niounomiya siblings."</p>
<p class="null-p">Supporting each other--</p>
<p class="null-p">I used to think their relationship was too one-sided.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that's not it.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Rizumu-chan was for Izumu-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Izumu-kun was for Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not a matter of thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's already beyond logic.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was made to think a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fox masked man went "Hmm" and added in a punctuation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The conversation has strayed. Let's go back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..yeah---that's right. Then I will ask---- you said that Assistant Professor Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan failed to die , what do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly what I said. It's not really something I want to explain to an outsider…..well, I guess you're not that much of an outsider. Asking only what I want to ask would be unreasonable." The fox masked man said as a preface. "You see, I should have killed them twenty years ago---no, that's wrong. From the world's perspective, saying I threw them away would be more correct---I abandoned them . Right, those are the words…..that is the correct answer. I abandoned the two of them "</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I still don't understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Researching not dying . That was originally my subject…..I think you heard it from Kuchiha, but it was my subject. Let's see, it will be a bit of an embarrassing story but…..when I was about twenty years old, in other words when I was about your age." "I am nineteen and a half."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'I am nineteen and a half'. Hmmm. Then that's exactly that…..the me at that time, really, really didn't want to die . If you were to say it plainly I wanted to live a long life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Oh…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought that everyone wanted that, but now that I think about it, being possessed by that kind of thing at that age is surprisingly rare. It's not just me, young people, immature people, are quite nihilistic. Finding meaning in a long life should happen a bit later once you have matured a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried to calculate it once. Everything I held an interest towards, how much time was needed to know all of it without leaving anything-----what came out was an astronomically large number. At the very least, with the human age limit of 120 years, it's not enough. This is where I ended up with my speed of thinking and computational ability. It's quite a stupid calculation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that I was afraid to die. I was afraid of not having enough time to live. Ending without knowing what I wanted to know. Dying while having things I don't know, that would have been unacceptable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So….. researching not dying , huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Meeting Kuchiha was what you would call a coincidence ----just, a coincidence. Well let's just say there was someone raising Kuchiha-chan before me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….a connection between researchers, is that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. The Kuchiha before that, was more like the pet of a nouveau riche. By the way, it seems that you met Kuchiha. How was she? How old did she appear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seventeen…..seventeen or eighteen. About that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then the same as me." The fox masked man said. "When I also first met her, Kuchiha was about at that physical age. If you can't believe it, then inside that diagnosis room…..well it's now the laboratory , try to go there.</p>
<p class="null-p">There should be some pictures left----from twenty years ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then…….being a pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">" It has that meaning . A meaning just as hellish and nasty as what you are imagining. People who don't die, it doesn't matter what kind of beastly treatment they receive. She didn't receive a monstrous treatment, so she's still on the human path I guess…...even just living with no physical defects is paradise. Buying her cost quite a lot, you know? It seems they had an attachment to Kuchiha….no matter the form, being loved may not be a bad thing, but thanks to that the price went up a lot. I had to use all of the fortune that I had saved up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a story that didn't concern itself with human rights or ethics.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem being what it is, I guess there was nothing that could be done. "And…….for about six month, I was with Kuchiha….while being helped by a supporter named Kigamine…..hmm. Kigamine, huh. For some reason we got along well….if she had any talent, I'm sure we could have walked together…..I didn't think she was continuing by herself. Incompetence is humanity's tragedy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…..did you stop the research on Kuchiha-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I realised that it was futile" The fox masked man said frankly. "That is an abnormality that happens once in an era. She only has about sixty years of memory-----but, well judging from the contents of her brain, that seems to be the limit. Or, I guess it's more about capacity rather than simple memory. Even you don't remember the memories of when you were a kid ten years ago. That kind of feeling-----Kuchiha had about 800 years, from what I found out with hypnotherapy, she lived for about 800 years, even just that should be a highly valued phenomenon, but……..kukkukku, despite having lived 800 years, she had quite a vulgar character, but, whether it be 800 years or 1000 years, if just living made you enlightened, then no one would meditate. There's also a bias on outward appearances…..hmm. 800 years. It should be a highly valued phenomenon but her existence would definitely not occur again. To begin with, Kuchiha had abilities close to a human…..but her body was health itself, and she also had high ability to produce immunity, her regeneration and recovery abilities were out of the norm-----but she lacked reproductive capability. In short, she can't leave descendants. It would be di erent if we could clone humans but…...even then, it would require precise techniques to copy Kuchiha's abnormal condition. In other words, her undying body can't serve other purposes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..that's why you abandoned them"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But to them, I didn't say that. Hmm. maybe they didn't have the recognition of having been abandoned. But that didn't really keep me from my objective…….I just moved to the next stage. Although that next stage was also a failure…..it wasn't just a failure, it was truly an extreme failure. I told you that before. Now I am on the next…..of the next and one more after that. That was why I employed Rizumu to search for Zerozaki … ….it seems that was also a misfire, furthermore this case should have been just a little settlement, but for some reason Rizumu and Izumu didn't come back, so I was wondering what I should do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki Hitoshiki</p>
<p class="null-p">He was at that stage?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's a good story for me to think about…….but I find it a little miserable that those two were still continuing. I might be a piece of garbage, but even I have some compassion. How should I say it…...it's like how I felt when I saw a computer trying to calculate the decimals of pi…..or the tragedy of the water drinking bird…..like a youkai trying to draw water with a dipper without bottom…..like a satellite eternally revolving around Earth…...that kind of image, or a feeling like this. Anyway, whether I requested it or not-----nothing would change. The people obeying the story , whether they die at a di erent point, they would just live the same life as a corpse. Whether a failure died or failed to die. In this case, I thought dying would be better. I thought it was sympathy, now that I say it. It's what they call an executioner, I guess. Frankly, I also wanted to erase my past" "Following the story ----huh? Just for that reason, you tried to kill two people?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder for which reason, I can kill two people? If it becomes two hundred million people, then can I kill them without putting up a sign about justice or peace? It's the same thing, so for me, it's su cient." The fox masked man did not show any guilt. "Furthermore, one of them wasn't a person. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"….right"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ho. I was prepared for at least one complaint about morals, but you're surprisingly calm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems useless to say it to you. Also….."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Also, things didn't go as I planned "</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask pointed at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My explanation should be enough with that. If I went too much into the details, it would violate their privacy……..besides, it's an old story. It's from twenty years ago, there are surely some mistakes in my memory. There is nothing less interesting than listening to the memory of a personal story. Now, I would like to hear the circumstances from your side. What exactly happened to Izumu and Rizumu, tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand……" I said. "But, regarding that I also….don't want to mix up personal stories, so it will be a broad outline, is that fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't bother me. I also don't want to listen to boring stories."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll tell you."</p>
<p class="null-p">I explained the di erent things that happened from the evening of the fifteenth to the morning of the sixteenth----I explained the gist of it all to the fox masked man. Because the man with the fox mask is outside the Kunagisa Syndicate's cover up operation, he couldn't have known what happened without employing someone like Chii-kun…...the man with the fox mask, besides interjecting from time to time, listened to my story. There is no way I can read his expression under the mask, but to the very end, it felt like he was very intrigued. For now, I mean, there is no obligation for me to tell him, so I hid that I (well, the Kunagisa Syndicate) was the one to do the cover up, so I mixed in a suitable lie in that area.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">After having heard the whole story, the man with the fox mask said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see----killed twice, the Niounomiya siblings, right"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask was mumbling----as if he was serene. Without lamenting, just as if confirming reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Is it fine if I take a little time to ask some more questions? Your story had some points that were fatally lacking in information."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's only a little, it doesn't bother me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That Yukariki Ichihime…..I know that name. If I remember correctly she was the existence also called Signal Yellow , or something like that." "No, that, I don't know if she was called like that…...we didn't have that close of a relationship."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'We didn't have that close of a relationship'. Then how about I put it like this….that Yukariki Ichihime with Shisei Yuma, didn't she pair up with the existence called Zig Zag ?" "…..So you know about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">He even employs professional killers of the Niounomiya , so it wouldn't be strange for him to know about the Hanging Highschool. However, even</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu the Man Eater , he didn't arrive to that point just from the name</p>
<p class="null-p">Yukariki Ichihime---</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected. Then that girl, she uses the String Techniques …and also with skill equal to that of Zig Zag …"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..What about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was surprised at how many people you knew. Not only Kigamine and</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-----but you even knew about that Zig Zag 's disciple."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask said as if putting on airs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To call it a coincidence-----it's too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….It is that a coincidence. That kind of thing"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. I wonder. You may feel the responsibility of Yukariki Ichihime's death on you, but that's wrong. The fact she died here, means that she would have died somewhere else……taking the name of Signal Yellow . Even if she didn't die here, sooner or later she would have su ered from something holding the same meaning as 'Death' from you. What you should grieve, about Yukariki Ichihime's death is that you involved yourself with it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Can I deny it?</p>
<p class="null-p">What the fox masked man said to me, what I requested of Izumu-kun, that if he were to kill assistant director Kigamine and Kuchiha-chan, to do it somewhere I didn't know, somewhere I didn't have any connections to-----asking him to not kill them just not in front of me ---- is the meaning that di erent from that?</p>
<p class="null-p">For example if Kuchiha-chan died in a tra c accident, if she died from a disease----I, would I have gone to the same extent?</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">That hypothesis.</p>
<p class="null-p">What meaning does this regret have?</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no meaning…...no meaning. Meaning is only gained through the process of accumulating results. That means the story, the tale. It's the same for Kigamine and Kuchiha. Only a piece of the story, whether they died or not, it's as if they died, because the plot of the story is written like that." "Story, is that it? Last time too, you said something like that…..." "It seems you still underestimate the meaning of the story. Well, it's fine even if you don't believe me…..however, for example. From the story I heard earlier, when you met Izumu there, it was not the first time, it seems you had already met somewhere else…..aaah, that's my second question. Where did you meet Izumu for the first time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Uum previously, at night, when…...he had collapsed, I found him"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Right, right, it's probably that. Hey. That too, for a coincidence----don't you think it's too much? Just before you saved Izumu who had collapsed, that you saved Rizumu who had collapsed"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No….that's not it. The one who saved Rizumu-chan was, er, a biologist in the middle of going home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aa, Kasugai Kasuga, right? And a famous person at that…...even though that's a famous weirdo . It doesn't matter. If Kasugai Kasuga didn't pick her up, then you would have done it. Even if you didn't pick her up, some friend of yours would have, and you would have come to know her. If not---"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The story, won't advance"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask asserted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, and also…..it's correct that Rizumu had collapsed, but Izumu hadn't collapsed, he was hunting "</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Hunting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He took his job of a professional killer too much to heart. That straitjacket was a shackle that was imposed on him during his hunting so that he didn't overdo it. It's not so unusual for it to be common among the inhabitants of that world…..especially in his case, because he made Rizumu carry all of his weakness . If he doesn't hunt regularly, if he doesn't devour people daily, he won't be able to stabilize his personality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The massacre time is one hour a day.</p>
<p class="null-p">…...I guess it wasn't entirely in jest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's say he was a workaholic who by momentum went too far and became a murder lover, a murder addict . It was correct for me to pick him up when he was too much to handle for the Niounomiya massacre group, the assassination technique group."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah….."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's like, again, I was hearing stories from a di erent other world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who exactly is this fox masked man----</p>
<p class="null-p">Which world was he a resident of?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Focus on that fact that you were chosen as the prey of that hunt …..what do you think about that? I think it is a part of the story, but you don't seem to think that. Don't you get it…..it's not a matter of probabilities."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not a matter of probabilities?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not one bit a matter of probabilities. If I said it, it would be Back Nozzle and Alternative. You, here, meeting me in this place, just a coincidence----maybe you think that, but that's not it . At that point you already possessed a connection with Kigamine and Kuchiha-----I was also involved in why Kigamine was interested in you. Between you and me, there is Niounomiya Rizumu, Niounomiya Izumu, Kigamine Yaku and Madoka Kuchiha, there already existed a flowchart----with that it would be weirder if we didn't meet. No matter how , in the end, you and I would have a link."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A link----?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I say it strongly, it's the principle of uncertainty. Not one of them is more correct…...in this world everything is correct . It disassembles to the level of the world and humans down to the quantum level, integrates di erentiates, analyzes, and finally proves it. The closest thing to my current objective is to express that----that would be the limit of expressing it with words. Right. No matter how we meet, in the end everything will converge towards a decided point. Even if the flowchart extends infinitely, eventually it will lead to one point. That final point-----I call it Dying</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to see it"</p>
<p class="null-p">The way the man with the fox mask talked.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was, not at all as if he was talking about a dream story. Serious and serious, a very serious tone, furthermore, it had the air of not accepting any objections.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..for me, it's a worthless story……" After having thought a little, I told my feelings honestly. "Even if that was the case-----even if what you're saying is true, that story, there is no room in it for me to enter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'There is no room in it for me to enter'. Hmm. You don't even have to say it, it was also a di cult problem for me…...becoming an observer in this world of quantum mechanics because that would contradict fundamentally"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Are your questions over?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm….yeah, that's right. Only those two points piqued my interest." The man with the fox mask nodded. "Although, my second question was just out of curiosity, the one that really mattered was the one concerning Signal Yellow----hmm. I see…...that's what happened. Well it's not an incomprehensible story. The little bird in the nest cannot be satisfied just by jumping forever. Hmm, that feeling----well, it's not like I don't understand it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Thank you, I will give you my thanks. Like that, I'm feeling much better. I will just go home…..you should do the same quickly. Even if you stay here, you won't gain anything. This place----</p>
<p class="null-p">Is already finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">It no longer has any connection with the story."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….But"</p>
<p class="null-p">"First of all, you already checked yourself, right? I don't know who did it but it has been covered up, here, there is no longer any trace of what happened." "Nevertheless…..aren't you interested? That the result of the massacre you requested happened in this absurd way. Even if not for that, the connection you had with Rizumu-chan and Izumu-kun…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was the case earlier. That's why I came here."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, that's already over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The unclear was , to an overwhelming degree, cleared."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly it kind of hurts---among the Thirteen Stairs , Izumu and Rizumu served me the most. How do you call that feeling, again?-----Attachment, yes, attachment. Lingering, yes, lingering. In that sense, it's not like there aren't some things to think about, but there's nothing to do about what has already ended. Even if I clapped my hand to make as much noise as possible, I will just leave my seat in silence. Silence-----kukkukku, exactly silence. Rizumu and Izumu, it seems they wish that from me----it's been a long relationship, I will give them that as a departure gift."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, that means, Mister Fox, in other words…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…..Even though, unlike Rizumu, I'm not a great detective or a weird anomaly. It's not like every answer was conducted through deduction or anything. Nevertheless…." The man with the fox mask said while choosing his words. " If I put together the information I knew in advance with what I heard in your story, I can imagine the gist of what happened. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"The gist, you say…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, the gist . I still don't know what did the cover up. Hmm. The general image----an exact image. When it's this beautifully clean, proof and evidence mean nothing. Furthermore, everything you said was not necessarily true, and also there's still the possibility that the information I had prior was false---well, the last part I just wanted to say it as self-concealment. In this world there are countless fools who don't get self-concealment, but from what I saw you don't seem to be one of them. Essentially it's a promise to not take responsibility----even though, there's probably no error." After the fox masked man said that much, he stood up from the cushion. "Even if I say that, I can't really tell it to you, there are things that will stay without answers even if you ask. At the very least, people's secrets aren't things that should be told lightly----you understand that at least that, right? Unlike them, my mouth is quite hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That, I understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">I understood it enough to understand it too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's not the type of question where thinking won't give you the answers. That's why, instead of thinking here, I think it's much better for you to think at home. If you stay in this finished place, you will just feel depressed. If I didn't come here, what were you about to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What I was about to do…..even if you ask me that. For starters" I looked at my gym bag. "I was thinking about going to the place written on Rizumu's business card when I first met her---"</p>
<p class="null-p">If luck was on my side.</p>
<p class="null-p">If luck was on my side, I wanted to meet you.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was thinking about finding anything, a residence, or even something not that concrete, anyway, I wanted information on you.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I won't say that.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I said that-----I would be admitting it.</p>
<p class="null-p">That even if I hadn't met the man with the fox mask here-----eventually, sometime that isn't now, somewhere that isn't here, the same conversation as the one here and now, would have occured ------I would be admitting it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's useless" The man with the fox mask admitted easily. "I won't say that address doesn't exist, but it's just a temporary residence. It's just one of many of the Niounomiya siblings' hideouts. Even if you call there, twenty four hours a day all year long without any embarrassment, it will not go through."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">I sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like I was already at a dead end…….if it comes to it, except for having Kunagisa ask Nao-san, so that I can hear from the people who operated the cleaning, I don't have any other move. Considering it's not a case where Kunagisa is involved in, I don't feel too good about borrowing the Kunagisa</p>
<p class="null-p">Syndicate's help, but if I don't have any other move-----then is that okay? If what the man with the fox mask said was true----this, this may not be a case that can be resolved with that kind of e ort or that kind of work.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inspiration.</p>
<p class="null-p">A leap in the way of thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Psychological.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is necessary, is logic that works on paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">Methodology over logic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Magic more abnormal than logic.</p>
<p class="null-p">What I need is that counterfeit magic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---However, that kind of one-o idea, that style of nonsense, is my specialty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. Then, it's a question of time. If you're someone that can attain the answer, then no matter what happens you will attain it someday." "Yes….but, even if you say someday, I only have about two days left. That is the time limit imposed on me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's something you decided yourself, then you will make some e ort. For me too, one of my worries disappeared, so now I will be able to go to the next stage with some peace of mind….what should I do, I still haven't decided on a foothold. I don't think that method of approach is incorrect but------either way, if I don't have the key, the door won't open, huh…...rather than a key, what doesn't exist in this case is a knob, I guess….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The next stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Point.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I ask or not?</p>
<p class="null-p">I hesitated, but if I let him escape now, I wouldn't have another chance, so I decided to ask.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..The man you made Rizumu-chan investigate, Zerozaki Hitoshiki ….about him, listening to what you said earlier, it doesn't seem you were doing it just out of curiosity. It seemed there was a firm objective…...last time when you said it, it was just 'I just wanted to get involved'….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are weirdly obsessed with that"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask seemed a little suspicious. Certainly, my obsession concerning Zerozaki Hitoshiki was, fox masked man's perspective, to the point that you could call it abnormal, it probably comes o as bizarre. "Well it's fine-----no, that is correct. Without any lie, it's just that. I just want to get involved with that Zerozaki man. I only learned about Zerozaki Hitoshiki recently. Hmm, it got my interest. …..I will explain a little." The man with the fox mask sat back on the cushion. "Niounomiya Rizumu and</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Izumu, at the base there is the Niounomiya Massacre Magic Group, the Niounomiya Performing Arts group, there are multiple organisation with similar structures under their jurisdiction…..among them, there is one called Sawarabi. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sawarabi.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder if its meaning is the combination of colors of the attack. In The Tale of Genji, one of the ten families …...the clan in which Nakagimi went to Tokyo was Sawarabi , if I remember correctly. To be honest, I don't really remember.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That Sawarabi , there was a case where there was a head on battle with the Zerozaki I talked about earlier, you heard about it from Izumu, right? It's just that there was something that my antenna detected----as an existence more than Cloud Bloodied by purple or Mind Render , Zerozaki Hitoshiki's name. I told Rizumu the other day, about the serial killing Zerozaki Hitoshiki had done in Kyoto----precisely, the head on battle that happened just before that. And after borrowing Rizumu's help to investigate here and there, he is truly a holder of an interesting destiny . Rather than interesting----he is the holder of a destructive destiny"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said that, that other time."</p>
<p class="null-p">The demon kid who was born from the union of two Zerozaki.</p>
<p class="null-p">The purest among the purest of serial killers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Perhaps that existence known as Zerozaki Hitoshiki----- being able to observe the story without taking part in it , I thought that he could be the first step to achieve that goal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The beginning of that idea was something I got from Kuchiha. She said that, right? That Kigamine employed you for that reason…… 'I don't a ect anyone', she said something like that, right? If we go back, that was my line."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There…. you tried to give an explanation of her undying body there." "Yes. Well, it would be a bit too exaggerated to say that it has no e ect…….maybe Kigamine explained it, but the human body, or rather the animal body, is programmed to die. Without searching for a way to reprogram that, immortality is impossible. Even you, it's not like you have never thought about why living creatures are dying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….It's a problem of the diversity of species, right? In other words, to die individually means to not die collectively…...that's the meaning." We commonly say things like 'this year's cold was quite bad' but from a biological standpoint, saying something like that every year would be correct. Every year, viruses and even bacteria transform and evolve into versions that humans are not yet immune to. If you don't view humans as individuals, but instead arrange them as a group….. death doesn't exist there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Continuing to live------forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It may be easier to understand if we used plants as an example. Rather than counting them one by one, it would be more accurate to count them by colony. In other words, in regards to Kuchiha, it would be more accurate to count her as something other than human. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not a person-----is that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Not a person, not an animal, not a living creature, that's why she can't die. If she were to die, it would only be at the time of extinction. "</p>
<p class="null-p">Extinction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Extinction----has occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Kuchiha-chan has died.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say grand things like it's an undying body , it's not like it really can't die…..if you destroy its stomach, then it will die normally. The point is that she was of a di erent species from humanity." The fox masked man said with a disillusioned tone. "The paradox between growth and evolution, was it? Maybe she was an extraterrestrial life form"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that possible?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't say that possibility is impossible. However, my interpretation is a bit more fantastical…... I think she might have been someone from the outside of the story . In regards to the story, she might have been a character that was not supposed to appear. That would mean an out of place character has managed to slip itself in. Hmm. It's as if a character from a science fiction novel made its way into a detective novel----if I say it like that, it might be easier to understand. In short, it's like that. Kuchiha was an unavoidable bug who got itself into the program known as the story, she was a typo who infiltrated the novel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her name------it was probably not registered in what I would call the Akashic Records. From the beginning, it was as if she was not there. The outside bit into the inside. It's nothing special, it was just damaged."</p>
<p class="null-p">A contradiction-----a misprint.</p>
<p class="null-p">A failure of god.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he didn't bestow death upon her, she won't die.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not that she won't die.</p>
<p class="null-p">Death is just lacking.</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of thing, truly, it was as if Kuchiha-chan was on the brink of death while she was still living. Her strangely careless and self-deprecating words, they were like spears piercing through you one by one. The words that came out earlier felt alien , but bizarrely had a strange persuasive power.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see---the worlds we live in are di erent.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not about species or kinds.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not about the side on the surface and the side at the back.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's about a resident from a di erent world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then----there's no way we can analyse it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her existence is similar to that fortune teller.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only way is to give up on trying to understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">But there are also things that can be gained by abandoning understanding. That fortune teller said it------that there are sometimes people whose hearts can't be read, whose future can't be read. Kunagisa Tomo was like that for that fortune teller. I decided that it was because Kunagisa's heart is too deep, but in reality it wasn't that, it was because her name wasn't written in the story-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, statistically there isn't any creation without bugs or mistakes….Kuchiha's existence was something inevitable and indispensable to the story. Perhaps there are more people like Kuchiha out there….being immortal may not have been a bug or an error, but anyway, that unnecessary existence had to exist as something necessary and indispensable. That would become a paradox that would forever remain unsolved but…..obviously, this is only a conceptual story, I have no interest in analysing that undying body with reason. It's something out of bounds even for me. Perhaps, she had eaten the flesh of a mermaid…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yao Bikuni.</p>
<p class="null-p">800 years.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even you have read Takahashi Rumiko, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently he likes Shogakukan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to have a talent for leaving things you don't understand as they are"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, yeah. That's important, you know. Even if I could clarify the method to not die , the next stage that I chose after not being able to replicate it was to use a di erent method to achieve the same objective. Not dying is giving up. Because even without an undying body ----there is a way for me to know everything that I want to know. It's extremely clear and simple----</p>
<p class="null-p">I just need to read the story.</p>
<p class="null-p">With Kuchiha's existence, I'm confident that the story exists. As long as there is a typo, there is a story . That's obvious. That's exceptionally obvious. It's so evident that putting it into words would be a waste of time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reading the Story, is that it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's-----an observer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ultimately, that's an observer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once you are convinced of the Story's existence, you become convinced that you want to read it. That's not a unique feeling. Because, achieving that would become one's deepest wish. The key is to separate this way from that way. The strong and the weak, the not so strong, and not so weak, the good, the good enough, will build a monument similar to the Tower of Babel. I'm fine as long as I can observe that pyramid from the sidelines.…...Something like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kukkukku, the man with the fox mask laughed in between.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Having said that, until now, I've been repeating that trial and error approach in a variety of unsightly ways…….in regards to Zerozaki Hitoshiki , he was supposed to be the fourth approach----so that makes it the fourth defeat. For the current me who is lacking Rizumu, searching for his whereabouts would be too di cult. I must move to the next step."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…for 'the current me'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought I told you. I have been expelled from causality, so I can't move on the surface. Rizumu and Izumu are no more, so I must search for di erent stairs…..there are very few Stairs in the first place, so losing two here is a bothersome and strange story. …..Hmm. well, this concludes the conversation about Zerozaki Hitoshiki. Have you been satisfied?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…..that was very useful."</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, I still didn't understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still-----I at least understand this.</p>
<p class="null-p">This person-----I must not make him meet with Zerozaki.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am certain that it will become something outrageous.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's hard to imagine that that human failure had a meaning this active, that that serial killer whose only raison d'être was to kill had such an ultimate meaning----but still.</p>
<p class="null-p">I must not let this man meet him.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's certain.</p>
<p class="null-p">…..thinking normally, I shouldn't have to be this tremendously worried. People don't meet so easily. In films and novels, if you happen to be walking for no purpose, you may meet someone that you know or someone that you were thinking of by chance -----but to recognize that phenomenon in real life, the are in which it could occur would be overwhelmingly limited, it would be about the scale of a high school drama. Once you take a step into the city, you can't do it anymore. Encountering by chance someone in a car, or witnessing by chance two people being together. That kind of thing is just a delusion. Accidental meetings don't happen that often, and fated encounters are absolutely impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore, Zerozaki Hitoshiki is dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the result of Rizumu-chan's investigation.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no meeting or parting with a dead person.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met Izumu-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met the man with the fox mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only by chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">With probabilities that could only be described as inevitable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like in a story.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems Kigamine was doing her best to break destiny on her own, that's also why she contacted you----but that too, was unnecessary. Wanting to break open your own destiny, that's neither a bug or a typo, it's just the regular presumptuousness that humans like so much. She wasn't breaking open her destiny at all. From the start, Kigamine searched for someone like you -----even you, before being proposed that job, before being contacted by Kigamine, you already-----um, what was it again…...right, you had already heard about her from Aoii Mikoko, you already knew about Kigamine Yaku. Hmm. At the very least, to the extent you remembered it, you held interest in Kigamine Yaku. Kigamine forcibly twisted her schedule and repeated excuses to set up that stage, whether she contacted you or not……whether you participated in the job, sooner or later, whatever you did , you would have met…...and you would have met Kuchiha. Sooner or later, that's the only di erence."</p>
<p class="null-p">I met assistant professor Kigamine.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met Hime-chan in June.</p>
<p class="null-p">I metKasugai-san in July.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met Aikawa-san in April.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met Zerozaki in May.</p>
<p class="null-p">What about Kunagisa? And, what about Magokoro?</p>
<p class="null-p">That-----can I say that was just a coincidence?</p>
<p class="null-p">That------would be way more impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'A rebellion against causality. A revolution against the existing destiny, a declaration of independence attacking the coming inevitability---', I have already passed my immature and romantic period where I could think things like this. Those observing causality. Those gazing at destiny. Those enjoying the inevitable----should leave combat to the slaves. I am a man who has changed positions and opinions a lot, but only that won't change, I will tell you the purpose that I've held since I was born.</p>
<p class="null-p">'To make this uninteresting world interesting-------'</p>
<p class="null-p">until it's exhausted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Interesting, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. In that sense, Kigamine's aesthetic sense in regards to choosing you is considerable…..you, you are truly interesting. The more I hear about you, the more interesting your existence becomes. It's not like you haven't thought about it, right? There were five people and four died, the reason you were the only one to survive . Why is that? Is that because you were the killer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, that is----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's wrong! You, you have too much potential to die in a place like that…..isn't that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……you're overestimating me." I answered like always. "As you can see,</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm just a kid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. That part is di erent from the old me, huh…...certainly, it's as Kigamine and Kuchiha said, you resemble the old me -----it's not the personality or the appearance-----it's the soul. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"The soul………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The soul of humanity's worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">…………….</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't argue against it. I couldn't object.</p>
<p class="null-p">Far from that, I was about to accept it.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Aah, so that was it?', like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just barely-----I managed to regroup.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't toy with me-----someone like me, I'm just the weakest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Humanity's weakest, the nonsense user"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Strength is weakness, and weakness is strength, you know. That probably means that your weakness has already turned into strength. Since I've said it, there's no mistake. Well, your Story is still filled with many more consequences----what will happen from now on, the current me can't predict it yet. The only advice I can give you would be that, everyday, enjoy yourself with fun and amusement."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's what I'm the worst at."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naturally. It's simple, and therefore it's di cult. It's di cult, and therefore it's interesting. Participating in a game where you can't feel bad if you fail is not fun at all. There is no meaning in just participating, winning and gaining joy, failing and gaining humiliation, that is where there is meaning."</p>
<p class="null-p">Victory and loss-----are just preparation for the sequel .</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask stood up suddenly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looks like he wants to go home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought, is it fine like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">I was suddenly uneasy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, is it fine to let the fox masked man go home?</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, we only talked about other things, it feels like I've heard nothing about the case. Are there still things that I should hear? If he has realized the truth of the matter, then if I asked he could tell me------no, there is no meaning if I don't realize it by myself. It would be no good if he just told me. However, still, if I don't manage to catch a hint, then won't I just stray further from the truth-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Any hint.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..You look like you want something."</p>
<p class="null-p">The fox masked man said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how you ask, I can't answer the things that I can't answer. If it's anything else, then only one. I will answer only one more question."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only one…..is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was lost. What could I ask? What should I ask? Destiny. Inevitability. Causality. Kigamine Yaku. Researching not dying. Madoka Kuchiha. An undying body. Yukariki Ichihime. Zig Zag 's disciple. Kasugai Kasuga. Freeloader. The Saitou Clinic. The man with the fox mask. The nonsense user. Shit. Shit. Shit. No matter how much I think and think and think and think, the answer won't come. The best question in this situation, I can't come up with a question like the ones of the man with the fox mask. Only vague and worthless questions come up.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, it's not like I don't have a hypothesis.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like I can't explain what happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kunagisa too said she had an hypothesis. At the very least, from the fox masked man's reaction, I know that there is a clear answer .</p>
<p class="null-p">However----no matter what I try, with only that, it's weak.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's weak.</p>
<p class="null-p">To break through that weakness, no matter what I do, there's a prerequisite that I must tear down. But that prerequisite is too firm and tough. It's a castle with tremendous defense to the point you could call it absolute. It was the kind of hypothesis that felt like it was the kind of escapism that was comparable to falsifying history.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah…..fuck, I want a smarter brain. I won't ask for something like</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san or Kunagisa. I don't need that much. What I need is the minimal ability to achieve the greatest result, the mind of a Strategist ------</p>
<p class="null-p">"---------Hagihara Shiogi"</p>
<p class="null-p">I said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hagihara Shiogi-------are you familiar with her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hagihara……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you know Shisei Yuma and Yukariki Ichihime…...maybe you know that name…...or so I thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">"More than knowing her-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask said, in a tone as if he was amazed by my carefreeness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That girl, she's none other than the one who turned the Massacre Magic Group,the Niounomiya's Performing Arts group against the serial killer group, the Zerozaki clan, it's that crazy kid. You, you also knew about someone like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…..well, she's an acquaintance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"One theory is that at that time, two people, Mind Render and Seamless Bias, were on the Zerozaki side…….being stuck in between a pincer attack by those big scissors and that nail bat, it must have been a hell that I can't even imagine. Even with just half of the rumors and what I heard from Izumu, Hagihara Shiogi the Strategist ------she surpasses my imagination, she's the ultimate monster."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiogi-chan, was she someone that amazing?</p>
<p class="null-p">I said some impertinent things.</p>
<p class="null-p">But------</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if it wasn't at least that much, it would be a problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, what about that Hagihara Shiogi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…...um, I heard a story of Hagihara going against the Niounomiya…..at that time, Izumu-kun and Rizumu-chan, the Carnival Niounomiya siblings, did they fight against Hagihara?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an instant response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If the rumors are true, then Izumu's combat skills can't compare against Hagihara Shiogi. He would be led around by the nose and that would be his downfall----Even with Rizumu's incredible weakness , it probably won't do anything against the Strategist . I will say it just in case, but that doesn't mean the Niounomiya siblings are useless. Because Hagihara Shiogi can even toy with Fragment at her will. Hey-----you, if you are acquainted with Hagihara Shiogi, won't you introduce me to her? Perhaps Hagihara Shiogi could be my that. The demon kid of the four gods and one mirror. Hagihara</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiogi, the Strategist . If I were to try to guess a little, her calculation speed is probably five times higher than mine-------I thought a destiny where I could meet a monster like that was impossible, however if I met someone like you, things may not be that desperate. Even if I'm wrong, I would be willing to give one of the seats of stairs , as there are two seats left without Rizumu and Izumu. The four gods and one mirror can't handle someone like that, Hagihara Shiogi is a blade that would cut with my calculation ability."</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask continued with a feverish tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, bro. I ask you, please introduce me to her. Then I could answer the questions I couldn't earlier. The cheap truth behind this case, I could teach it to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No-------it's a very tempting o er, but Shiogi-chan, since the organisation she was a liated with has been destroyed, I got cut o . I can't contact her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…..that's too bad." The fox masked man was clearly disappointed. Depending on the angle, he seemed more disappointed than when he heard of Zerozaki Hitoshiki's death from Rizumu-chan. This man, that fact that he was holding such emotions, I was a little surprised. "It can't be helped…….Back Nozzle can also work against you. Things that won't happen will definitely not happen, and even if they do, they have no meaning. Well…….still, I will continue to think that I may meet her some day, if we have a connection. If she's as much a monster as the rumors say, as long as she's not attacked by her relatives, she probably won't die------by the way, what does that give you? I didn't get the point of the question, but with that you won't get anything. I still have a little bit of time, I could give you another chance."</p>
<p class="null-p">" No-----it's fine like this. "</p>
<p class="null-p">I answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright----I got it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I finally got around it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had a leap of imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">The magic was dispelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ceremony was completed.</p>
<p class="null-p">If they didn't fight against Shiogi-chan-----if the Niounomiya siblings didn't go up against Shiogi-chan------ then the answer will come out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that I think about it, that was the only restraint.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that's the case, then the prerequisite would collapse.</p>
<p class="null-p">A simple thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">A clear-cut thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">The answer------was only that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much, Mister Fox."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah….. I don't really get it, but, well, if you're fine with that. You don't seem to be blu ng either. Then, If we have a connection-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the man with the fox mask was about to say his signature phrase, from my pocket echoed a sound like an alarm. That was the ringtone Kasugai-san had installed without my permission. That heavy metal that sounded like hell, who was the one singing-------</p>
<p class="null-p">I really don't want to think about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really-------what a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Is it fine if I leave?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. Please excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Then, I will go now. Ciao"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the man with the fox mask turned his back, I took out the phone from my pocket. The number displayed on the digital screen, I've seen it already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really………</p>
<p class="null-p">It should have taken three days.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Hey!'</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, I got yelled at.</p>
<p class="null-p">'You, what are you hiding from me you moron!'</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I moved the phone slightly away from my face.</p>
<p class="null-p">My head shook.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, Jun-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even I.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even I, in this situation, can't call her by her family name.</p>
<p class="null-p">'It's not hello! Why didn't you contact me about the fact that Ichihime died earlier, you bu oon! You didn't contact me, and more than that, I see you tried to cover it up! I don't know what happened, but did you think I was going to blame you?! Am I that lame of a person, idiot! I was the one who entrusted you with Ichihime, you, what are you doing trying to steal that responsibility o of me!! That is mine, give it back!'</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">'If you fail something I will forgive you, so explain the situation! You're an annoying guy, but I don't care, you should really start to trust me! Why does my greatness not come through to you, even you, you must know it, right!? That I'm the best, or is it that you're too stupid to understand that?! I'm coming over now, so don't move from there!'</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Really…….</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, this person feels good.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a good person.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to thank her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And tell her my gratitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">That I was able to meet you.</p>
<p class="null-p">That in the story, I was able to meet you.</p>
<p class="null-p">…….but.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….you don't need to worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's end it already.</p>
<p class="null-p">The period of time where I caused trouble for you------it ends here. In reality, I wanted to be under your protection forever, even now, really, I think that from the bottom of my heart. I want to hide in your shadow for the rest of my life, I even thought about becoming someone who tells your stories. Telling your story, from the exterior, I want to be an observer. The fact that I know you, is my pride, and my dignity.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's no longer any good.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's------not forgivable anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not something that will be forgiven.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because that ------is mine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to worry"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Huuuh?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Already……..the main part has been resolved. I only need to finish it up…..I am truly sorry, but this time, I am the one who will wrap things up. " I-----clearly, putting all my determination, said. "On that occasion, I will gladly borrow your power but--------will you help me? I'm going to come up with a plan -----could I count with you on that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'……………...'</p>
<p class="null-p">For a little while, Aikawa-san was quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">'That's quite…….optimistic. How?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's…….nothing much."</p>
<p class="null-p">'Okay, that's fine. I will hear it when we meet….then, where do I need to go?' "Will you accept?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'You're looking down on me. What would happen if humanity's strongest contractor refused a request…………...I don't really know, but it seems interesting'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Obviously. After involving you in this matter-------Jun-san, I wouldn't do something that would bore you."</p>
<p class="null-p">'Hah. Then let's do it flashily-----it's Himecchi's battle of revenge. Since the Niounomiya's Performing Arts group is involved, I'll be able to not hold back for once'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then……..for now, let's meet up at the Kyoto Imperial Palace. I will head that way now. At the moment, I'm a bit far------if you give me three hours, I think I can get there"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Roger'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then see you, Aikawa-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, don't call me by-----'</p>
<p class="null-p">I hung up halfway.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a bit pleasant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, the preparations are done.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's go do what I want to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of thing------since I have never done it until now, I don't know what will really happen-------but things I don't understand, I can just leave them like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what, the results will come out.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter which results.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which results?</p>
<p class="null-p">No, the result is unique and decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I was about to stand up from the cushion,</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask, still with his back turned,was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't you go home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Aikawa…….Jun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mumbling, the fox masked man said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he turned back with incredible speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was horrible enough to make me feel the pressure from under his mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just now, you said Aikawa Jun, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yes…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without thinking, I nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask's body was trembling…...he was vibrating enough to make you think he was having an attack, while convulsing, he was cowering. Compared to earlier when he heard Shiogi-chan's name-------it was a much more violent reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aikawa Jun------Overkill Red, Death Colored Crimson------Hermit</p>
<p class="null-p">Killer----Desert Eagle-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…….?" Death Colored Crimson? "Um, Mister Fox-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Kukkukku"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ahahahahahahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man with the fox mask, with all of his strength, laughed. " So you were the right choice ! When we met last time I thought it was possible -----but it was further than possible ! There's nothing further than that! Truly unparalleled! How is this possible?! Not on Zerozaki Hitoshiki's but on your side! That ordinary looking man whom I met at a insignificant place and by chance ------Ahahahahahahahahaha! Kigamine, you really really really have a good eye! That's what I expect from the woman who, without bending, followed and followed and followed after me! Okay, at the end I finally respect you! I will kneel before you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait…...um?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You! Ahaha, you, what are you exactly?! While being an ordinary kid with nothing special----what's up about all this treasure mixed in your surroundings?! It's a melting pot of the atypical and di erent, you truly are hell! AhahahahahaAhahahahahahaAhahahahahahahahaha!</p>
<p class="null-p">Hahahahahahahahaha! Pleasant, pleasant! Interesting, interesting! It's been a long time since something this interesting has happened! Why is the world so interesting, it's truly a mystery! How murderous and crazy is this universe?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------hi"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without thinking, I was about to let out a scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">I instinctively withdrew.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah---- scary .</p>
<p class="null-p">For the first time in my life, I felt fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">All the fear that I had felt until now------is nothing compared to this. If you say that this is fear, then everything I had felt up to this point is not fear. My heart rate increased as if my heart was exploding.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fear fear fear fear fear. fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is, fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's unthinkable nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">This man is----</p>
<p class="null-p">Scary.</p>
<p class="null-p">A cold sweat seeped out of me. My heart cracked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, until just a second ago, I can't believe I was having a conversation with this person. Just how thin the rope I was walking on was…….I don't want to think about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He-he-help-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wonderful! It's too wonderful! ----I see! Having not encountered Zerozaki</p>
<p class="null-p">Hitoshiki -----my destiny was to meet you. What a splendid Jail Alternative. Normally, a double of Zerozaki, a cross of an ultimate murderer and an absolute murderer, an alternative shouldn't exist! Why, why! However, my hypothesis wasn't wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Firmly, he grabbed both of my shoulders without holding back. "Ahahahaha! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, kukkukku---</p>
<p class="null-p">Nice to meet you, my enemy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I finally found you, I'm counting on you for our future relationship, I wish for a long relationship!</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then the man with the fox mask sent me flying. I landed on my butt on the tatami. The fox masked man finally stopped laughing, and, "Kukkukku" he laughed again and showed me his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's time to leave this place. This clinic is too lame to be the stage for our meeting. It's not even an introduction, it's at best a foreshadowing. Well, now I will be busy, I will be busy, it will be hard, it will be hard, it's a furious dance, it's a confused mess! It's fun it's fun it's fun it's fun, run, dance with joy and joy and joy and joy! Go crazy, go crazy, break, break go ill, go ill, go ill, go ill! Sing, sublime, get pleasure, collapse! It's the end, it's the beginning, it's the stopping point, it's the quickening! Well--------I must do my preparations. Only half of the Thirteen Stairs are present-----because I didn't think things would advance that quickly, you, for starters, you, this rubbish , you must close this story concerning the Niounomiya siblings. If you are left with this worthless thing , that will be a problem for later----- I don't care whose power you borrow, clean it up properly . I don't want my fun to be lessened by even a tiny bit. Did you hear?</p>
<p class="null-p">Put your heart into it. Hold all the confidence in your soul and be self-aware.</p>
<p class="null-p">You, now…… you have just closed every other destiny."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Closed….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For you, there's only causality with me left. No, it was like that from the beginning. It's an unavoidable destiny, it's the Story's plot. Now you and I can't go anywhere-----now you won't be allowed to take a detour of even one step until the Dying Epilogue!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does that mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the same whether it has a meaning or not. Then, since we have a bond , we will meet even if you don't want to. Until then don't neglect to forge yourself. Realize that diligent study is the only duty you possess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After crossing the doorstep, the man with the fox mask stepped into the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">I----</p>
<p class="null-p">"You….who are you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost impulsively. Even while thinking that I didn't want to involve myself any longer, I asked. I couldn't stay without asking. I couldn't conclude without asking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You…..you, what are you to Aikawa-san." "Hmm…...me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fox masked man turned only his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">He took o his mask, and showed his true face.</p>
<p class="null-p">His true face that looked a lot like her's.</p>
<p class="null-p">His smile that looked a lot like her's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am me. The time to name myself hasn't come yet. My introduction will be on another day. To name myself with an identifier…..let's see. I guess, humanity's worst player----or something like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the man with the fox mask continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aikawa Jun, is my daughter."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/zaregoto/illustrations/zaregoto_vol_06_16.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">0</p>
<p class="null-p">Goodbye.</p>
<p class="null-p">There won't be another chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">1</p>
<p class="null-p">Death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's think about death.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this world, this is something that holds a big meaning, something that doesn't die doesn't exist. All molecular structures, both living and non-living eventually arrive to their death in sadness. No one, nothing, can escape from that law. To the point that you start to think that everything exists for the sole purpose of dying . Without exception everything arrives to death. If we can somehow stop our train of thought here, that would mean that death and nothing are not equal. At the very least by thinking that way, humanity has been able to face the concept of death.</p>
<p class="null-p">The more extreme example of that is religion.</p>
<p class="null-p">We gave meaning to death .</p>
<p class="null-p">We gave a sequel to death .</p>
<p class="null-p">We gave a resurrection after death .</p>
<p class="null-p">Both medicine and philosophy are the same as religion in trying to overcome death. Yes, everyone is afraid to die. A human being who is fine with dying, I can only imagine them as not correctly understanding what death is----that they falsely think they will be the only one not to die, I can only think they have a wrong conviction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or perhaps, that they will really not die.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, people have to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the rule.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not dying-----that would be against the rules.</p>
<p class="null-p">Against the rules of the game that is this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, how would that feel?</p>
<p class="null-p">To be continuing forever?</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, if you don't end somewhere, then you won't be able to endure it, right? If they don't set an end somewhere, people will get tired, right? The reason people can sprint is because they only have to go for one hundred meters------without defining an objective or a destination, there's no way one can run at full speed. It is said that the end exists because there's a beginning, but only because there's an end can people have the determination to begin something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really.</p>
<p class="null-p">Does everyone really think that they don't want to die?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is life that amusing?</p>
<p class="null-p">I wasn't like that. I thought it would be fine to die whenever, not only that, the old me didn't even make the distinction between being alive and dead. That's right, the me of that time----before I even met the one who will become the red punishment, the orange seed, that young blue boy, or even my little sister, at that time-----I didn't know about life or death.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I didn't know, I was strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">The me not knowing of the end was strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I was strong-------I was weak.</p>
<p class="null-p">An undying body.</p>
<p class="null-p">What if I was given something like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">If there was no end.</p>
<p class="null-p">If they were given eternity, what would humans become? Pain would become dull, wars would stop, and I'm sure various other things would have to be abandoned. The feelings that were important when there was an end would be easily thrown away-----</p>
<p class="null-p">And people will spend their time as if they were dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the truest sense, it's nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I had no problem dying, when life didn't mean anything to me, I spent my time like that. The me who didn't know life or death. If something is fine with dying, then it doesn't exist to begin with. Life and death, there was no need to di erentiate between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was not an inhabitant of a world where life and death existed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why----</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the same no matter what I did.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was the weakest, so I was the strongest.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was the strongest, so I was the weakest.</p>
<p class="null-p">And I can say one more thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">I--------was the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">This still hasn't changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dead as if I was alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Living as if I was dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to forget I was living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wanting to forget I was living.</p>
<p class="null-p">In others words, that's how it is.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because that's how it is, don't break the rules.</p>
<p class="null-p">Recognize death. Acquire death. Catch death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Confront death. Win against death. Battle with death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are you afraid to die?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even then, face it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Devour death.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is that kind of story.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you're resolved to die, you will be able to not die while you're living. "……….It's about time "</p>
<p class="null-p">I checked the time on my phone for the last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The date that was displayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nineteenth of August, Friday afternoon-----5 minutes until 11PM.</p>
<p class="null-p">The old clock on the wall displayed the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned o my phone and put it on top of the dinning table. I was told to contact Aikawa-san anytime, and even without being told that, I knew that was the right way to do things, but even then--------I don't want any unnecessary nuisance. I don't want any unnecessary data mixed in. If that happens, the scene that I have prepared will be ruined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was in the same place as yesterday, in Assistant Professor Kigamine's research facility-------formerly, the Saitou Clinic, alone in the waiting room, without even the lights turned on, sitting on the cushion.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't come back to the apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday, after that, I went to the Kyoto Imperial Palace and had an all night discussion with Aikawa-san-----about Hime-chan, and about the plans from now on-------and then, I immediately came back here.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I came back to the apartment, I felt that my resolve would dull.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right------I am weak.</p>
<p class="null-p">My resolve would lessen with such a small thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if there is a solution on one side, and an explanation can be seen on the other side, I only have the uneasy, brittle, and flimsy intention to return to my original position.</p>
<p class="null-p">Good grief. In the truest sense, I'm pathetic.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's a limit to how spineless I can be.</p>
<p class="null-p">Can I really accomplish it with that?</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice of doubt that was gushing out from the inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Do you really understand what you're about to do? If you really understand, then you shouldn't be acting so carefree. Am I wrong? Aren't you just trying to act cool?</p>
<p class="null-p">Always vague.</p>
<p class="null-p">With an indecisive behaviour.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's unclear whether I'm alive or dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Can you fight with that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">------it's laughable.</p>
<p class="null-p">I won't fight.</p>
<p class="null-p">I won't win or lose.</p>
<p class="null-p">Winning or losing are just the way forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose, that's natural. There is no such thing as a life with only victories, and neither is there a life with only losses. The ones who continue winning just don't notice those who continue losing, and the ones who continue losing just don't notice those who continue winning. The strong just don't know weakness, the weak don't know strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am weak, overwhelmingly weak.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if I notice that weakness ----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, even if that doesn't go like playing shogi."</p>
<p class="null-p">That reminds me, I heard from someone in the past that in modern society, there's no such thing as misfortunate as shogi players or go players. Their exceptional brain, it can only be used on the board. If the world was di erent, then the abilities of those Strategists could easily shake the whole world.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the same for everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even for Assistant Professor Kigamine who was only continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even for Kuchiha-chan who couldn't die.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even for Hime-chan, and Rizumu-chan, and Izumu-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of bad luck, that was bad luck.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of misfortune, that was misfortunate.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, on the same level as me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, they would probably not wish…...to receive pity from someone like me." They are not dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Make this uninteresting world interesting-----</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ding-dong.'</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the intercom.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tried to check the time, and remembered that I had turned my phone o .</p>
<p class="null-p">So instead I looked at the old clock on the wall. 11PM exactly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprisingly, it seems they are precisely on time.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no sound of the door opening.</p>
<p class="null-p">No sound of someone taking their shoes o , no sound of walking into the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">That level of sound-----was completely erased.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly afterward, the sliding door opened with a clatter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Yo."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was the one to speak first.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had no intention of getting a preemptive strike.</p>
<p class="null-p">First of all, that kind of thing wouldn't work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He who had opened the sliding door------</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Izumu tilted his head as if confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">2</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun wasn't in his usual straitjacket.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was wearing thin leather pants and a leather jacket. It seems like he wasn't wearing anything under the jacket, so you could clearly see the shape of his bones and his thin and slim body, his white skin, and his thin breasts. He wasn't wearing any socks and was barefoot. Now Izumu-kun's long arms were no longer hidden in a straightjacket and I could clearly see them,</p>
<p class="null-p">I noticed that they did not match with his small stature.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those fingers-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? That's weird….I was called here by the Death Colored Crimson …...that should be the reason I'm here." Izumu-kun said as if he was out of place, deeply confused from the bottom of his heart. "It seems that Yukariki</p>
<p class="null-p">Ichihime was Death Color 's kin, so to get revenge-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aikawa-san is my girlfriend. We are in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">I straightened my back and faced Izumu-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're quite something too. That sort of thinking is clearly impudent. You think you're gonna fight directly to death with my girlfriend? Even in games and novels------before the final boss, there's always a middle boss."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun looked at me with piercing eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed he had trouble responding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………and, you're the middle boss?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahahaha!" Izumu laughed at a high pitch. "It's the first time I've see a middle boss this weak! Even mini Bowser is a little stronger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….I have no words to deny that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..ha, hahaha. Ah….I see. You too. You're angry that I killed that</p>
<p class="null-p">Yukariki. No, I really do feel bad that I had to break our promise."</p>
<p class="null-p">Breaking the promise.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if he was only apologizing for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">About having killed Hime-chan-----</p>
<p class="null-p">It was if he wasn't even thinking about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, I'm relieved." I strung the words together while half ignoring Izumu-kun who was still laughing. "Well, I thought it was near impossible, but I thought that maybe, it would be Rizumu-chan who would come here.</p>
<p class="null-p">That possibility of that wasn't zero"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's right…..ah, that means" Izumu-kun said. "It's not just Death</p>
<p class="null-p">Color, you're also aware of our sibling's trick ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah" I nodded. "Or rather, the one who realized and relayed it to Aikawa-san was me. However, if Aikawa-san had been involved in this case from the beginning, I'm sure she could have closed it without anyone dying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will tell you just in case."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun said normally, without losing his calm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hating me is absurd, you know? You're barking up at the wrong tree, Death</p>
<p class="null-p">Color obviously, but you too. It was on Mister Fox's orders that I massacred</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine and Madoka. What's wrong with a professional killer killing? When you kill someone with a firearm, do you think that it's the firearm's fault? It's not, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...but, Hime-chan was"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaah, that kid, it's true she wasn't my prey as a professional killer .</p>
<p class="null-p">However." Izumu-kun said. "Even then, when an organism is about to get killed , it has to protect itself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..If I remember correctly self protection was allowed in our contract, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Right."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, it was like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">So it was like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what we finally agreed on in yesterday's discussion with</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san. There were other possibilities that couldn't be determined, but that means, as expected, the one who destroyed the tires of the Fiat, the</p>
<p class="null-p">Katana, and the Z was Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan, you idiot.</p>
<p class="null-p">But in this case, the idiot wasn't only Hime-chan. Aikawa-san shouldn't have chosen Hime-chan as my bodyguard, and I also shouldn't have agreed to that. Regardless of whether the tires were punctured, at that time I should have gone over the mountain and returned to the apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan was a former soldier. She had a personality that wouldn't let her leave an enemy in front of her. That's how she was raised. Aikawa-san and I should have known that. We should have understood that. That there was no way for Hime-chan to leave the Cannibal , the Niounomiya before her eyes alone. That was something we should have understood already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan's sense of duty was too strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her habits didn't leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her past bad habits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her fighting instinct.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, I wonder how Hime-chan noticed that you were a Niounomiya . You had adopted a false name, and Rizumu-chan was properly performing in front of Hime-chan..</p>
<p class="null-p">"The smell, I guess" Izumu-kun said. "Don't you know? Murderers, they have the smell of blood and rotten flesh ingrained in them. I had seen that Yukariki Ichihime was a murderer , right? Then, the reverse isn't impossible, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Or, that's what I would have wanted to say "</p>
<p class="null-p">However Izumu-kun continued further.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Don't forget that I have Rizumu-chan to make that impossible . As long as Rizumu is there, us siblings couldn't possibly have been exposed as a professional killer "</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In other words, you and I were too careless. It's not Rizumu's fault, nor is it Kigamine's fault. You and I, we carelessly spoke too much. At that time, I shouldn't have come out to the courtyard and you, you shouldn't have told anything to Yukariki Ichihime."</p>
<p class="null-p">Me?</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it should have been hidden from Hime-chan. I didn't confess about having known Izumu-kun and Rizumu-chan before.</p>
<p class="null-p">…….However.</p>
<p class="null-p">With unnatural behavior , it's not like nothing would've been seen through.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place, for Hime-chan, maybe just me asking her about the</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya was enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, as I thought, it's my fault"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows. Anyway, we're probably already at the point where I can't fool you with jokes. It wasn't a truth that could be covered by a lie. No, no, Yukariki Ichihime was surprisingly not that stupid. It means she must have held quite a lot of insight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, I had forgotten that too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan might have been an idiot, but she possessed a brilliant combat sense. Furthermore, Hime-chan was very good at lying. She wasn't just good, it was already similar to my nonsense, it was kind of her way of getting by. Even that, I should have understood it su ciently back in June. It was a fabrication that would make you not notice what you had already noticed , and she created that as if it was normal----</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, she was a strong enemy. I wasn't able to go away unscathed. I didn't have any experience against String Technique users. That kid, her abilities as a soldier were through the roof. She wouldn't be inferior even when compared to a pro player, she was nearly at the highest level. Who is she exactly? Maybe she is a celebrity to the level that Mister Fox would know about her. I didn't think that a string technique user would appear on my line. I was surprised"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you tell me the details?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Details? Ah, I see. Unfortunately, I can't tell you the details. When she was alone with Rizumu in the middle of the night, it was already decided that we would fight in the courtyard. For us , there was no reason to decline and flee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She touched the keyword , so I came out and it became a battle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, at that time, she left just after I was called by Kuchiha-chan to go take a shower. If I assume that, then encountering her on the stairs would match timewise. When I returned to the room after exchanging words with</p>
<p class="null-p">Kigamine, she was already no longer in bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, what was she thinking? Was she thinking that she could return again? Or maybe-----no, there's no point in thinking that kind of thing. Thinking that, if that were to be true, then there would be nothing to be saved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our world is flexible due to violence. Pacifism is ultimately based on violence. If she won we would have erased ourselves from before you. That was the condition. I said it, you know? That I wouldn't lay my hands on you, but she wouldn't even listen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, she was a hard headed girl"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. She's not the type who listens to her enemies, so she won't live a long life. Oh right, I killed her, didn't I? Gyahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Laugh" Izumu-kun wasn't even trying to hide his irritation and clicked his tongue. "Essentially, Yukariki, she had killed too many people to live. Once you become like that, it's already too late. Having killed that many people and then trying to live, and as a normal high school girl at that, it's too shameless. Even you understand that, right? That Yukariki Ichihime had killed too many people to continue living. Yukariki Ichihime was too strong-------she was too weak"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had killed too many people to continue living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe that's true.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan had always been taught.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kill the enemy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hunt the obstacles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't let risk factors escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't hesitate, think after having cut their head o .</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't let the occasion escape, don't trust, you will get killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">She has been taught that forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the point where she was stained.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the point where it couldn't be removed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Enough to not be able to count her own death as death.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the point that if there's an enemy nearby, she can't hesitate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, was it already too late for Hime-chan?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was everything too late for Hime-chan?</p>
<p class="null-p">Happiness and fun----</p>
<p class="null-p">Was everything too late?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's……..not the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">That wasn't the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can assert it.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter who says what, I can assert it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..After having killed Hime-chan, what did you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, at first when we started to battle, I had no intention of killing her. There was also the promise with you." Izumu-kun confessed reluctantly. "But, I had no other choice than to kill her. I had no other choice than to kill her. I thought she would calm down after having both her arms devoured , but that wasn't the case at all. That kid was no joke. It was impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even for Shiogi-chan, handling Hime-chan and Tamamo-chan was di cult. She wasn't half-hearted, she wasn't half-baked. She wasn't an adversary you could fight while holding back. She was too strong. Even the</p>
<p class="null-p">Cannibal couldn't hold back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was nothing I could do, so I advanced the plans . Having killed one person, I had no other way than to change my schedule…...even if that meant breaking my promise with you. To begin with, there was no longer any promise or anything since I had killed Yukariki at that point. It was mostly invalid. The promise was already destroyed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Well, that's right"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, in regards to Rizumu's field work , since her investigation period only lasted a day, she hadn't reached a conclusion, but to some extent, she already had an inference for those two. Even though she's my own sister, that's quite some work in one day. However, unfortunately there's no filling in the missing information. That's where I decided to speak honestly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I asked those two. Kigamine was awake while working, and I woke Madoka from her sleep. 'I was sent here by Mister Fox, probably the Saitou you called your master, he told me to kill you, what will you do?'"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun showed me his long arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if tempting me.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if seducing me.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if inviting me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The two said 'please do that' and nodded. Against that, I was at a loss."</p>
<p class="null-p">" Please do that …….was it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even I couldn't hide my surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">My voice trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was unexpected.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Aikawa-san didn't say that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In regards to Madoka, she said something about not wanting to dirty the bed, so she chose her place of death to be the shower room. In reality, those two were probably tired."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Assistant Professor who continued following that fox masked man.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who had died without being able to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">They got tired.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tired, as if rotting.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why------they accepted death?</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of fantasy is absurd. They had just given up with the professional killer in front of them. They only despaired at the sight of the professional killer sent by their former master. It was nothing more than that. Who can die for a reason such as being tired? If you do that kind of thing------</p>
<p class="null-p">If you do something so brazen as if you were imitating an insect-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Death would lose meaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you accept death, then death doesn't even exist.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you're not alive, then you won't die.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because you won't die, you're not alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in the truest sense-------</p>
<p class="null-p">An undying body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I am tired too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun said.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a voice as if he was really tired.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am tired too. Tired of killing people. Tired of working. From killing those two, from talking to them, that's what I thought. No. I've been tired since a long time ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..That's." I said. " That's why you, after that the reason why you erased your existence "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before I knew it, Mister Fox was describing me as a workaholic, a murder lover, a murder addict, and I can only say that that's entirely correct. But, what comes after addiction is just boredom"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Boredom?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Not even overwhelming, not even ultimate, not even absolute, not even lethal, just boredom. Do you know? There are some species that have a system implanted in their DNA that makes them die naturally when they are bored. I once heard from Mister Fox. Don't you think that's the best program? …..those two also, weren't they just bored of living?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's----"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Kuchiha-chan, I understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">She…….had lived too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Assistant Professor Kigamine?</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably hadn't lived long enough to be bored.</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably wasn't living.</p>
<p class="null-p">She shouldn't have been living.</p>
<p class="null-p">" The reason why you were tired, wasn't it rather because you fought with</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...maybe, that's possible"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun nodded for the time being.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't deny it.</p>
<p class="null-p">In truth, I didn't understand. But still, Hime-chan, Kuchiha-chan, and Assistant Professor Kigamine, killing those three was probably more of an opportunity than a cause for Izumu-kun. The trigger is not the bullet itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">A little bird inside a cage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun was, of continuing being a Niounomiya ----</p>
<p class="null-p">Of continuing being kept by the man with the fox mask----</p>
<p class="null-p">Of continuing being Rizumu-chan's back-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Of continuing being Rizumu-chan's front-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Bored.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahahahaha!" Izumu-kun suddenly laughed loudly. "Well, that is why! I was thinking of trying to stay secluded, but then I was contacted by Death</p>
<p class="null-p">Color . What was that? What, what! Was this all something you set up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because no matter what, I wanted to see you."</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to meet.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to meet and talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact Izumu-kun was about to enter into a life of retirement after that incident, I had guessed it from the fox masked man's words. A little bird inside a cage. That in itself is fine. That's Izumu-kun's own selfishness. The problem was on the side of my own selfishness. It was about how to find out about Izumu-kun's whereabouts.</p>
<p class="null-p">For starters, no matter how you think about it, it was impossible for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if I asked Kunagisa, Izumu-kun was a resident outside of the Kunagisa Syndicate's range. Setting aside the fact we couldn't investigate, that would also mean having to cross a somewhat dangerous bridge. That kind of thing, there's no way I would let Kunagisa do that. So, it was the turn of the one who inhabits all worlds, humanity's strongest contractor, the red punishment, Aikawa Jun to appear.</p>
<p class="null-p">'But to call out Izumu who is retreating, we're gonna need a decisive bait, and these guys aren't half-assed about that kind of thing. If we contact him poorly, he will just escape. Do you have such a convenient bait?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At Aikawa's question, I answered 'You don't need to worry about it'. Right, I had heard before what Izumu-kun wishes for. The thing Izumu-kun is wishing for-----I heard it. At that point, I still didn't know that the Death</p>
<p class="null-p">Colored Crimson was Aikawa-san, but</p>
<p class="null-p">-------that was convenient in itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was more than convenient, it was a good connection.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Hmmm" Izumu=kun narrowed his eyes. "It seems I'm a popular guy. But, unfortunately, I don't particularly want to see you. Gyahaha, am I a guilty man? Haha. Well, speaking seriously, I don't want there to be any unpleasant feelings. Even so, are you really concerned? About the promise I broke."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say such cold things. I'm persistent, you know? If someone like me becomes a stalker, it would be the most dangerous thing in the world. Be careful about how you handle it." "Gyahaha…….I get that you're not joking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I set up a battle with the Death Colored Crimson , you know? That's your lifelong wish, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than a wish, I'd say it's a regret</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun spread out his arms like a peacock.</p>
<p class="null-p">Long arms. Those excessively long and thin arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an intimidating pose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I…….I wanted something to measure exactly how far I've come. In that sense, you got a nice thing set up for me. Soooooo, how does this system work? After breaking through you, Death Colored Crimson will appear?" "Aikawa-san isn't here. Only I know the place. Aikawa-san will be waiting there for you until a certain time passes. If you can make me talk you win------if you can't make me talk, you lose"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My win and my loss, huh. Hmmmm. My win and my loss------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun repeated as if chewing on it. "Don't you have a win condition?" "The only one who can win is you. Either you win, or you lose, only one of those. I have no intention of doing any of that." While thinking that my lines were ridiculous and silly, I clearly said so without getting embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just want to realize,"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Realize? What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows---"</p>
<p class="null-p">I took out the pocket knife from the holster. Since I had been sitting there for a long time, I had imagined it all the way through. I pointed the knife towards Izumu-kun who was facing me, put my left foot on the table, and aimed at that thin neck---</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Boring"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instantly, my field of vision rotated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without having the time to grasp what just happened, without having the time to realize that my foot on the table was somehow brushed away, I fell on the table on my left shoulder. Instantaneously, I protected my body with my right hand, but before the next action happened, Izumu-kun's foot extended towards me, and those toes were pierced through my ribs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…...Ah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A weird pain I had never experienced before attacked my abdomen, making me roll and fall o the table. The cushion that I was sitting on earlier absorbed the shock, but it couldn't absorb all of the impact.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a crack, my ribs creaked.</p>
<p class="null-p">By now, there was pain in the ankle that had been brushed away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh, uuuuuuuh"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not broken, I just removed about two ribs, but don't push yourself. Those misaligned ribs are no longer armor but a weapon to your internal organs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I couldn't restrain myself with the leg I hit, so there may be a crack. If it's just that you can bear it, you're a man, right?" Izumu-kun said while laughing slightly. "So, where is Death Color ? Where should I go to meet</p>
<p class="null-p">Death Color ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Good grief" While tolerating the pain still running through my abdomen, I lifted my upper body. I glared at Izumu-kun. "In your world does Cannibal mean a pervert who fondles people with this end of his foot? I can't introduce such a low level pervert to Aikawa-san. To introduce you to</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san, you must be a little more deviant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….It seems you don't understand." Izumu-kun didn't follow my cheap provocation. He talked as if he were persuading a child. "The gap between your combat power and mine, it's not a gap that can be filled with spirit, bravery, or even your skillful nonsense. At least, when it comes to fighting a head on battle. Looking at you, your body is somewhat trained, and I understand that your reflexes aren't that bad either, but I am a professional player. Your movements look still to me. Whether it be an ambush or a trick, even If I respond after confirming your movement, I can still react in time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Torture is Hakamori's territory so it's not my speciality, but it's not like I don't know how to do it. Hey, I won't say anything bad. Before I cutely do something heartless, I'll say it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cutely, huh……" I repeated Izumu-kun's words. "Then don't you think there's a better way than torture? If you try to seduce me, I might easily give it away. Your nipples that have been appearing and disappearing have been on my mind since earlier. Aah, but……...that's that, that, yeah, that. It's that so it's kinda, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's no good with people younger than me------- somehow, it reminds me of my little sister, and that makes me lose interest. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...I don't get you, dude." There was some irritation mixed in</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun's voice. Anger at me who he couldn't understand, it didn't seem like that. "I don't get you, I really don't get you. I can only think that you're crazy. How is your brain doing? Yeah--, yeah--, yeah--, yes yes yes yes! Then, the very gentle professor Izumu will explain it so simply that even a pig could understand it. I will show you a sight that's much easier to understand than words. A death sentence for both of your eyes. These arms" Izumu-kun showed me the back of his arms from the elbow. His fingers that were facing towards the back of his hands, they took the form of a rake. "Do you know? Or don't you not know? These were the origin of me being called Man Eater . These arms themselves are my specialities. Look at them carefully ------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Izumu-kun rotated his arms, bent both of his rake-like hands backwards, and swung down both of his arms at the table!</p>
<p class="null-p">"---- That's how it is !"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of destruction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, it was the sound of an explosion.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I opened the eyes I inadvertently closed them again because of the impact. Izumu-kun's arms were pierced into the tatami on the floor up to his wrists. The table, as if a grizzly had swung down on it, as if it was eaten , was completely gouged through.</p>
<p class="null-p">The wooden table was about five centimeters thick.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was-----with those thin and feminine arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not The Hand. It's my, Niounomiya Izumu's treasured sword, Eating One. " Izumu-kun laughed creepily. "If you train the human body without thinking about the consequences, you can reach this level. I'm a living example of that. Obviously, not just this Eating One , even these legs, if I kicked normally, I could easily bend something like the human neck. The incredible amount of restraint I had to exercise on your ribs…...you already understand, don't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----- Eating One. "</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan had her upper and lower half separated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant professor Kigamine had her left shoulder cut o .</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan had both her arms cut o .</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…….I was thinking about what kind of weapon you could use to be able to do such a thing. So you just used a hidden technique."</p>
<p class="null-p">I must be quite something to be able to sleep amidst all those explosive sounds. I had heard about Eating One from the man with the fox mask, but I didn't think it would be a one hit surekill to that degree. I see, it's as Kunagisa said----the ultimate abnormal. Abnormal abilities that go one level beyond ultimate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Izumu-kun will exert even more kindness and teach you a good thing, Onii-san. The weak point of that technique, or rather it's drawback, is that I can't hold back at all. " Izumu-kun showed me the palm of his hands that were still in the form of a rake, then showed the back of his hands. "That's why I had to wear that straitjacket so that I didn't go on a rampage. Gyahaha. In fact, as you can see, I can only produce that level of destruction power. That's the default, I can't set it to di erent levels. That level of power that can even destroy an iron plate is normal. However, that's not a weak point but a drawback. Hey you, think about it. If you ate this thing, or if you were eaten by this thing , it would be a tragedy. You can't defend against Eating One , defending has no meaning. If you took it with your arms, they would just be blown away, if you took it with your legs, they would just be blown away. In fact, even more than the damage, the wounds it leaves are even more ugly. Even though it's my own treasured sword, it's unpleasant, it's like an explosion. You can't even stitch together the torn o wounds. It's an irreparable, absolute injury."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun picked up a shard o the table that was scattered away, and threw it lightly towards me. The shard fell just besides me.</p>
<p class="null-p">A shard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or perhaps, a piece of meat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I haven't tested it, but with one hit from each of these arms, I could probably erase a child the size of a preschooler from the world." Once again, Izumu-kun faced me, and spread out his body. "However, when I slaughter I always use this because it's not painful . Since I break the nerves faster than they can transfer information, it doesn't hurt at all. It's close to benevolence, but essentially it's just because I don't want to hear screams. It's best to have the least amount of su ering. That's the same thing for your scream and your su ering. That's why…...when I do it I don't hold back, even against a guy like you with no combat abilities, when I do it, without any leniency…...I use this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…...kind of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun didn't even follow up on my interruption.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, he looked at me with pity.</p>
<p class="null-p">The overwhelming gap of ability between Izumu-kun and me, that was easier to understand from Izumu-kun's point of view. Looking from above, you can much better understand the overwhelming gap between top and bottom. That's why Izumu-kun can't comprehend why I'm doing something so meaningless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether there is one or not, it's the same thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will say it one last time"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to say it."</p>
<p class="null-p">While still standing only halfway up, I pulled out the Jericho that was in my belt behind my back, and pointed the barrel towards Izumu-kun. "BAAANG"</p>
<p class="null-p">I pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">The shock echoed through my side that was kicked earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Ch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun jumped to the left. He evaded the bullet. Or rather, by the time I took out the Jericho, he was already taking an evasive action. Even though he shouldn't have noticed that I had a firearm-------that's the reason I attacked with the knife at first----that's quite some reflexes. But that too was not unexpected. A human being against whom guns don't work on, I have already experienced something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I ran.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without chasing Izumu-kun, towards the sliding door, towards the hallway. "…...Don't fuck with me-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………don't fuck with me, asshole!"</p>
<p class="null-p">From behind, a scream echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected he's impulsive.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also furious.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much leeway you show, no matter how calmly you behave, when danger that could hurt you appears, that disguise goes away. Your leeway and your calm are awfully superficial. Your boiling point is below the freezing point. Yes, that's Izumu-kun's strength and therefore his weakness. Especially because he's specialized in toughness, he's vulnerable.</p>
<p class="null-p">And there's one more thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that exchange, Izumu-kun evaded the bullet. The fact that he evaded means that if Izumu-kun had been hit by the bullet, even the Man Eater would have su ered damage.</p>
<p class="null-p">He's not invincible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither is he the strongest.</p>
<p class="null-p">You couldn't even call him the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">He's neither a ghost nor a youkai.</p>
<p class="null-p">He's a human, with a personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">I went into the hallway and continued to run. I didn't look back. I didn't even have to look back, I knew that Izumu-kun was following me. The footsteps that he didn't even try to hide pressed down with an excessive amount of force.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Uoooooooooooooooooooo !"</p>
<p class="null-p">The stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I turned to climb the stairs, I saw the image of Izumu-kun swinging his right arm out of the corner of my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">---------Eating One .</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------Guh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just barely, dodging so that it only grazes me, I stepped on the stairs. Izumu-kun swung his right arm too boldly, and lost his balance. That's right, because he always swings it at full force correctly, because it's an inhuman one-hit killer, Izumu-kun didn't bother to consider what sort of posture he'd end up in after using it. It may be that Izumu-kun lacks composure, but that is also his weakness.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Come here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was fixing his posture, I rushed up the stairs during that instant. My side started hurting. It may be bad to move around too much. In the worst case, my ribs could hurt my organs like Izumu-kun said.</p>
<p class="null-p">However------</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't care about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't try to escape, you lame asshole!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun yelled in the darkness with seemingly no hesitation, and then he got on the stairs and followed me. After confirming that, I arrived at the landing of the stairs to the second floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way you can escape in such a narrow space, idiot, stupid, fool!</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh, oh, oh, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned back towards Izumu-kun and jumped down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun expressed surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">But----it's too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">I let my body be controlled by gravity.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, on the stairs of this research facility that are so narrow only one person can fit through at a time, with the bad foothold and the wall and handrail on both sides becoming a hindrance, Eating One cannot be used.</p>
<p class="null-p">Flying body attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't something as clever as that, but with my elbow held up against his face, and with my other shoulder on his throat, I rammed into Izumu-kun. Even if he's a killer or a professional player, even if he says exaggerated things like Man Eater or Carnival , his body still has the stature of a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he tried to resist it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun bent backwards and lost his footing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun and I began falling down the stairs and arrived in the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">His body was sandwiched between me and the hard wooden floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun let out a moan as if he was sobbing. It was nearly a surprise attack. Even he can't have taken zero damage. But this is not the end. This doesn't count as having beaten the Man Eater . That's why I will use this chance. This is the last chance that I have.</p>
<p class="null-p">I untangeled myself from Izumu-kun, and sat on him. I pointed the Jericho that was in my right hand toward Izumu-kun's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point-blank range.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much he struggles, he can't evade it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----y, you…..asshole!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the last moment, Izumu-kun barely managed to lift his arms and grab the Jericho. Then, before I could even pull the trigger, he moved the barrel away from his head. I decided that I couldn't do it with one hand, so I also put my left hand on the grip and forcefully tried to fix the position of the barrel.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh----- "</p>
<p class="null-p">" Uguguguguguguguugu----- "</p>
<p class="null-p">This point-blank range.</p>
<p class="null-p">This posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even with those thin girly arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even with all of my strength, it wouldn't even budge. Rather, little by little, the barrel was shifted to the side. Where is he getting all this strength from? No, it's not a matter of strength. It doesn't seem to be such a simple matter on the same level as addition and subtraction. Izumu-kun began to fight back even while being sat on. Even though both his legs should have been firmly locked, with a force that would allow him to get free of this situation with even the slightest inattention, Izumu-kun began to shake his torso.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inevitably, that created a gap in between hands that were on the grip.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shit, at this rate they won't hold much longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is bad. This is bad. This is bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">How should I-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever.</p>
<p class="null-p">While still in that position, I pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the explosion, the sound of the gunpowder bursting out----of course, the direction the bullet went was very far away from Izumu-kun, so without piercing anything, it just hit in a plank in the hallway. But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..Guh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun's strength lessened for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you don't stop holding the barrel, you will receive all of the heat the bullet generates as it passes through. Not only that, but in addition, if you hear a gunshot near your ear, if a bullet passes near your ear, the sound will be transmitted directly to the brain itself as vibration. No matter how much training you receive, it's not like your structure as a human will change.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no way a direct attack on the brain will just go away.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Izumu-kun's strength lessened, I put all my strength and my soul into pointing the barrel back towards Izumu-kun's forehead. Izumu-kun put his hands back on the barrel, but there was not as much strength as earlier. Since I had just fired, the barrel hasn't lost all of its heat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------fu, fuck…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">An instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun completely took his hands o the barrel.</p>
<p class="null-p">He gave up. There's no way. But, in that lying position he can't use Eating One . ……. No-----can he use it ? Perhaps, he can use it by just using his arms and not his whole body? In reality, Izumu-kun moved his left arm back slightly and momentarily stuck it on the floor. In a movement as if drawing an arc, he swung his arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aiming at my face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without mercy.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Guuh------"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if I can evade it.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I can evade his Eating One , it would be set in stone. Once he misses, there is a big opening. The previous blow had already proved that.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the watershed moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">" Gu, oooooo------ "</p>
<p class="null-p">I bent my back as far back as possible, and avoided his palm. At least, I tried to avoid it. However, Izumu-kun's Eating One was so fast that it completely surpassed my reaction speed-----</p>
<p class="null-p">The truth is.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Izumu-kun's posture was normal, I would have eaten it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I would have been eaten by it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The gauze on my right cheek was torn o and turned into waste. It showed that with a literal paper thin di erence I escaped from the jaws of Eating</p>
<p class="null-p">One .</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright----</p>
<p class="null-p">Without time to confirm my success.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….. Ah. "</p>
<p class="null-p">I found out Izumu-kun's real aim.</p>
<p class="null-p">The arm travelling continued like that in a circular arc and hit the floor as</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun likely intended.</p>
<p class="null-p">The earlier gunshot stood no chance against that explosive sound. The floor that was eaten and scattered into thousands of shards which flew towards me. Without any regards to my will, my eyelids instinctively closed in order to protect my eyes-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Da!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the confusion, I put strength into the trigger. The knockback of the force came back to me. And while feeling the pain of the pieces of wood stabbing my face, I opened my eyes to confirm the results----</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Gyahaha" Izumu-kun---- didn't su er any injury.</p>
<p class="null-p">With Eating One he bit through the floor of the hallway and shifted his head, which was supposed to be fixed in place, away from the barrel . Rather than just sending shards flying, that probably was his main goal. No, the plan was to attain both.</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Izumu----</p>
<p class="null-p">This is bad. He's not an idiot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you didn't fire continuously, it seems like you're out of bullets-----Alright!!" With just his abdominal muscles, Izumu-kun threw me slightly up, and in that moment he bent both of his legs, passed below my legs, and once they were bent, extended them towards my solar plexus. "How long were you sitting in the cowgirl position, what are you, a pervert with a strong libido, you dumbass!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was sent flying into the air with so much force that I wondered if my body was suspended from a wire. I got thrown far backwards, to about where Izumu-kun and I were imitating the Shinsengumi, around one step below the landing of the stairs. I hit my back against the corner, and as if rolling over, I collapsed on the landing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't have time to be collapsed.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a pain in my back and side. It wasn't my ribs like earlier, but my organs. It felt like my organs were shaken around. Even if they had not ruptured, it was quite painful. There was no feeling of nausea so it wasn't digestive organs, it must be my circulatory organs. Then the situation is even more serious. I tried to stand up, but every part of my body was shaking and convulsing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guuuuuh----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahaha. You let your first and last chance escape."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at it------</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun was standing firmly on both of his legs in the hallway with a hole in it. Even though the sound of destruction that hit his ears should have been at the level that a normal human wouldn't be able to stand for a while, let alone think. What kind of semicircular canals does he have? With that sound right beside him, why didn't he lose his sense of balance? Maybe his body's structure itself is actually di erent? If that's the case, then how ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, for an amateur, let's say you did great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He regained his leeway and composure, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Good grief……</p>
<p class="null-p">I certainly…….let my chance escape. When Izumu-kun was going on rampage-----that was my one and only chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't have any bullets now.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't have any plans either.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like I had any plans in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..isn't it fine now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun said as he lowered both of his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you did your best with me as your opponent, with this Man Eater as your opponent, since you fought alone, even Yukariki won't blame you.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, tell me the location of Death Color ."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or is it that you don't know? Was knowing Death Color 's location just a lie that you made up?" Izumu-kun wondered. "No, that's not possible. If you did that…….I would definitely kill you. If the Death Colored Crimson is as strong and as scary as the rumors say, you shouldn't do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Think.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is there anything?</p>
<p class="null-p">A means to overcome this worst situation. A way to fix this situation where everything is already over. A way to open this situation that has been completely closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">If there was something that useful.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">You can't redo your life. You can't, no matter how hard you try. If everything in my life could be redone, then it might have been very happy, but wishing for something like that is too arrogant and convenient.</p>
<p class="null-p">For things like repeating,</p>
<p class="null-p">The result will still be the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...In the first place, this isn't about things like revenge or vengeance, right? You have the face of someone who doesn't know joy or sadness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's probably why Rizumu took a liking to you. You don't question what you're doing right now, right? You don't calm down, right? You don't calm down at all, right? Your body is so restless that it feels as if it really isn't your own, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya Izumu said in a confident tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I felt it the two times where we talked before and also when we were battling just now. I don't feel anything from you. Not even hatred against me, not even anger at the fact Yukariki was killed. I can't feel anything. That said, it's not like you're crazy like me, but you don't seem to be fighting at all. Rather, it's like you're trying to win by escaping. I don't understand, I don't understand, I don't seem to understand. For what reason did you battle against me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems you wanted to realize something earlier, but what was it that you wanted to realize? I don't get it. That's why I don't feel like killing you because you're weak."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Certainly"</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, I had no hatred towards Izumu-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">To tell the truth, I had neither anger nor resentment.</p>
<p class="null-p">That would be unreasonable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun was just doing his job. Hime-chan too, was just doing her job.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no place for sadness and regrets, or for anger and hatred.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">A person's death is only theirs. When other people put emotion in it and make it become a mess it's just pathetic. You shouldn't mix sadness with anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">You shouldn't mix sadness with hatred.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Interminably dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..it might be as you say"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..If it was like that, I should just have played the part of the narrator of a detective novel……and left the role of the detective to Kunagisa------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What are you saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying it's stupid !"</p>
<p class="null-p">I----</p>
<p class="null-p">Dashed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I climbed the stairs further to the second floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Really! I reaaaaally don't get you, fuck! Struggling like that is shameful!! Like a rabbit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouting, Izumu followed after me with a speed that would make you think that he took no damage from the ramming attack and the body press. This me who was hurt all over wouldn't be able to escape for more than an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that little bit is fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">That little bit is fine, so-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Guh."</p>
<p class="null-p">While I twisted the ankle that was hit earlier (the pain increased and spread exponentially), I arrived on the second floor. Without hesitating or stopping, I turned. I had too much momentum, so making the first room would be impossible. Further back, where I had spent the night with Hime-chan, or to be more accurate the hospital room where a fool spent the night alone, I jumped into it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I closed the door, and glided towards the bed. There I grabbed the sheet that had been beautifully laid, and with all my force, I threw it and spread it towards the door------</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the door opening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------------!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……… Uoooooooooooo !"</p>
<p class="null-p">I took out the knife I had put away again and along with a howl, I charged towards the sheet spread out in the middle of the room. Towards the door frame where Izumu-kun probably was-----</p>
<p class="null-p">The knife's blade went through the sheet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">But------</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no resistance.</p>
<p class="null-p">The spread out sheet closed itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun's figure was not there on the other side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then I saw it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun was stuck on the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">With both his legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at me there and laughing.</p>
<p class="null-p">He said his leg strength was not half assed but.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened the door, he jumped towards the ceiling, bypassing the sheet-----</p>
<p class="null-p">He did a triangular jump.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Gyahahaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore, after spinning in the air once, Izumu-kun stretched out his left leg and aimed for my heart. I promptly released the knife that was stabbed in the sheet and crossed my arms in front of the sheet. Immediately after I crossed them, I heard the sound of my bones. Rather than breaking, it was more like they were crushed. I was blown away and fell on the bed on my back.</p>
<p class="null-p">I lost all sensation in my arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ribs beneath my arms finally started to hurt. It seems that these were indeed broken. I was just barely able to notice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaa, gugu---kuh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even this wasn't Izumu-kun's full strength . That kick just now was only meant to be a threat, and as a means to close the distance between us. And with that…….my arms were crushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, a means.</p>
<p class="null-p">A means.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, after a jab.</p>
<p class="null-p">A straight is coming.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyahahahahahahahahahaha! Hya------------------hoo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I laid my back on the bed and spread out my arms and, looking upwards, I saw Izumu-kun with his arms curled back in the shape of a bow jump on the bed,</p>
<p class="null-p">Then,</p>
<p class="null-p">With those arms,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gluttony!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Two hits of Eating One .</p>
<p class="null-p">He swung down.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two shots were aimed at both sides of my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the image.</p>
<p class="null-p">My brain was shaken from both sides and I couldn't think about anything. It's not like the shock hit the center of my head, but with a synergistic e ect, it felt like my brain cells were liquefying. The bed was completely destroyed at two points and as if sinking, as if sinking in a sea of debris, my back reached the floor of the hospital room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….oh, dangerous dangerous"</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I instinctively was about to aim at you seriously, even though I shouldn't kill you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">My head was ringing. The shockwaves wouldn't quite leave my body. It felt like every ounce of the water in my body was undulating. Those waves echoing throughout made my damaged bones crack here and there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun pulled out both of his arms that were stuck in the floor, and in an instant, took his body o the bed. With no sign of injury on his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like it was as usual for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So…….was it this one?"</p>
<p class="null-p">An immense pain ran through my right leg. A little later, I heard what sounded like rubber snapping. To be honest, I don't really know whether the pain or the sound came first. Now that my body was hurting all over, I can't say that that one added pain had increased my su ering that much. "For starters, I cut the Achilles tendon…...if you want to recover, I think you shouldn't try to move," Izumu-kun explained honestly. "Both arms and both legs, with that you're out. So, what will you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What will I do you ask. Hey, Man Eater , don't you already have enough of a handicap?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun completely ignored my blu .</p>
<p class="null-p">It's no good………..I can't struggle anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">My strength was fixed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine now, big bro. Won't you start talking now? Where should I go to meet the Death Color Crimson ?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes, yes. By the way, how many human ribs are there in total?" Izumu-kun slowly approached me. "Twelve on each side, that makes a total of twenty four. Gyahaha, that's quite an amount, isn't it? Now, you already got two removed, and three were broken------nineteen remain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How many do you want me to leave?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Faster than I could respond, Izumu-kun moved his leg. I couldn't defend myself with my arms, and so I took all of those toes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nguh! Uugh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"One." Izumu-kun said. "Next, a second"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was calm. He was completely calm.</p>
<p class="null-p">With his legs that were the opposite of Eating One .</p>
<p class="null-p">One by one, without any sound, he aimed at my ribs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Three, four, five------ah, a short pause."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't even scream or call for help. My body was hurting all over, I didn't understand anything anymore. Why I was in this situation, it was already unclear to me. For what exactly?</p>
<p class="null-p">For who exactly?</p>
<p class="null-p">How did it become like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do I continue? Do I stop? You choose."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm begging you! It's enough already, isn't it?! If I do anymore your life really will be in danger! I hate not killing even more! This kind of thing isn't my hobby!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, I'll continue"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun's action resumed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah……</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm envious of these kinds of things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having a goal, and working towards that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being able to kill me for a goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being able to kill someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Murderer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the first place, there's no meaning to this." Izumu-kun said while continuing to act. "No matter how much we continue further, I won't kill you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..can't kill."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not because you can't use your arms and legs, you know? Earlier, down those stairs, you could have killed me . But you couldn't, but you couldn't kill me, that's why. In other words, you don't have the guts to kill me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not being able to kill.</p>
<p class="null-p">I------can't kill people.</p>
<p class="null-p">I think killing them is bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Killing people is a sin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Killing people is the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why I have been enduring forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I thought about killing a lot of people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Forever, I have been enduring.</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality-------It may have been like I killed them. Many people died. Most people thinking that I should die, ended up dying and most people who did not want me to die, ended up dying.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it's not like I directly killed them.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the only reason supporting me.</p>
<p class="null-p">A hope, and a basic principle and law.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I think.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it's not direct, is it not murder?</p>
<p class="null-p">Killing someone that was about to kill me, is that not murder? Then being killed back when you try to kill them back, is it not murder? That contradiction. That exponential. It's like a Mobius strip going in a circle.</p>
<p class="null-p">You shouldn't kill people.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the absolute taboo.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you break it, that's no good.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sure that it's very, very bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why while you don't break it, it's a solid wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you use guns, it's much easier to kill people than with swords. If you use poison, it's much easier to kill people than with guns. If you use magic, it's much easier to kill people than with poison. If you use words, it must be much easier to kill people than with magic------</p>
<p class="null-p">That's how, forever, I have continued killing.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have devoured all kinds of people.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have been eating all kinds of people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cannibalism (mutual eating).</p>
<p class="null-p">I used to think this word was written as Cannibalism (eating friends). Even now, half of me still thinks that.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, actually.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the bottom of my heart, truly.</p>
<p class="null-p">At most that's barking up the wrong tree----</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Kiyomizu stage at the Kiyomizu temple."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Kiyomizu stage at the Kiyomizu temple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's there. Aikawa-san. Until the sun rises, she'll be waiting for you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun retracted his leg.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder how many ribs I have left.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was interested.</p>
<p class="null-p">The pain mixed and I already couldn't tell what was hurting anymore. Won't you just become numb, will you? Quickly, so that I can't feel anything anymore, become numb.</p>
<p class="null-p">This pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">This pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">This pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew it enough already----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, I'll get going but……….should I call an ambulance?" Izumu-kun looked at my expression. "You probably can't even use your phone in that shape."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please." I answered. "There's a hospital I'm used to going, so contact them……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. What's the number?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I told him the number.</p>
<p class="null-p">That number, I memorized it before coming here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I thought it would be necessary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun called an ambulance with his cellphone. Even the aftercare is flawless. The recent professional killers have good services, so killing or being killed is not that bad. Ah, but, I wonder if Izumu-kun is gonna retire from that? If he's gonna enter a secluded lifestyle, at the very least he must have that intention. I wonder if it's useless or not. Though, there's no point in thinking about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be something pointless but……...it might not be something I'll get many chances to ask. But, in the end, you" After closing his cellphone, Izumu-kun said. "What did you really want to do? What did you want to realize to even end up in this state?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…….I don't know"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so……." It seems Izumu-kun stopped wanting to understand. Truly, it was a wise decision. "Then, I will go"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, to that Kiyomizu temple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think you should do that……."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hesitating, I decided to warn him. I don't care what will happen after this, but I thought warning him was better than doing nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aikawa-san has…...no mercy. Because Hime-chan was one of</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san's precious friends……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Precious friend, huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know…..I truly know. That person probably….. she probably killed</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki Hitoshiki. If Rizumu-chan's investigation was correct and</p>
<p class="null-p">Zerozaki Hitoshiki was killed, then one who killed Zerozaki Hitoshiki was</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa Jun." I mumbled. "I know it because I'm his alternative, I know it…… That person, I don't know why but……..against residents of your world, she has no mercy……..excluding Hime-chan".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. That's exactly what I wish for.".</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Why are you obsessed with Aikawa-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because that's why I exist. Although, that's just what Mister Fox told me. For me who specializes in strength , fighting against the strongest is necessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">A raison d'être.</p>
<p class="null-p">A proof of existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">For something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">For something so ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, that would be-----</p>
<p class="null-p">The same as me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you were finally free, you'll head to your death?" "It's fine. For me, freedom is only something long-awaited , so it's not something I'm attached to. And also, if you say that, for me, Rizumu is my precious little sister." Izumu-kun said happily. "Rizumu said she loved you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..well, thank you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnya. She's a pitiful girl, don't mind it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I thought it was useless from the start. There's no way to stop it.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's already no way to stop the overwhelming battle between Niounomiya Izumu and Aikawa Jun. I think Aikawa-san can't be satisfied without some conclusion with Izumu-kun who killed Hime-chan. That's already a fact fixed by destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the unavoidable Story.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Story.</p>
<p class="null-p">I just squeezed myself in there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Squeezed myself in, and forcefully made the story a bit longer, that's all. It's just that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was in an incomprehensible mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wasn't thinking about anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't hear Izumu-kun's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">My consciousness was fading.</p>
<p class="null-p">Vaguely fading.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Izumu-kun, from now on, what are you gonna do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, I don't know." Izumu-kun said while imitating my tone. "How should I say it? Well, for starters, I was thinking about starting to take back some of the weakness I was forcing on Rizumu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Strength is weak, weakness is strength-----that's why. For that, first I have to receive an overwhelming defeat from the Death Colored Crimson , that's probably it…….to continue living after having lost . It's surprisingly di cult."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, Izumu-kun." I said while staring at the ceiling. I had no longer had enough strength to raise my head to look at him. "If we have a connection……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please spare me. I don't know about Rizumu but------someone like you-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">He laughed like Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------I hate cunning bastards like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Without any sound, Izumu-kun left the hospital room.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't see him o .</p>
<p class="null-p">I absentmindedly stared at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I sighed once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I wanted to hear those words from you."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I muttered self-deprecatingly to myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The pain finally started to numb.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I had little blood loss, that kick I received at the stairs might be bad. I don't want to think about the current state of my body. Honestly, looking back at my life until now, it's probably close to the most my body has been damaged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah---"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe, I'm going to die like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Die.</p>
<p class="null-p">I might die.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, I remembered di erent things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Things from way back.</p>
<p class="null-p">About my little sister, about my family, about my friends, about my friends' family. About six years ago, about the five years when I lived in Houston, about the friends I made there, about when I got back to Japan. About Houko-chan, about Moeta kun, about Miiko-san, about Suzunashi-san, about Ukigumo-san, about Koutoumaru, about Nanananami, and, about Hime-chan. And also, about the people I met again after returning to Japan, about the new friends I met. Some people were enemies, some people hated me, and some people were friendly with me. The residents of Wet Crow's Feathers island.</p>
<p class="null-p">My classmates at the Ritsumeikan University.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls at the Hanging High School.</p>
<p class="null-p">The researchers at the Shadou Kyouichirou Research Facility.</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">Assistant professor Kigamine, and Kuchiha-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like they wanted to die, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">The truth is that they had been waiting forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were waiting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just that, really just that, they were probably not thinking about anything else. Just for that reason Assistant Professor Kigamine continued to continue, and Kuchiha-chan continued to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were probably prepared, even for eternity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Madly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until the limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Enough to make you want to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……that's that."</p>
<p class="null-p">I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The pain in my body had numbed, and rather my eyes started to hurt. The ceiling was blurred, and I couldn't see clearly. Everything I saw was blurry. Was it because the inside of my head wasn't clear? My eyeballs were hot enough to burn. My eyes hurt. My eyes hurt. They didn't take a direct hit, but maybe the waves of that last hit still had e ects. Probably.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm becoming kinda sleepy---</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's just fall asleep like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know if I'm going to wake up tomorrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">That also depends on the Story's next chapter.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I don't die, then no matter what happens I won't die.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I were to die here, then that would be it.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much I struggle, it's useless.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, it's not like I have anything I want to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have neither hopes nor wishes.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, that kind of thing, I don't care.</p>
<p class="null-p">So it's fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">It doesn't matter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Do as you like.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because it's been like that forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't even know if I'm alive or dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Vague and unclear, half-assed and hazy, not choosing anything and letting myself go along with other people, I led an uncertain life without deciding, that's why----</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I don't want to die-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I realized that I wanted to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">I learned at what moments I cried.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/zaregoto/illustrations/zaregoto_vol_06_17.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Height 138 cm, weight 32 kg (estimated). Three sizes, after having just begun going through puberty, naturally that's a secret. Bobbed hair, and skin is so abnormally white that it looks like snow. Only her lips were strangely red. Like a doll, her appearance looked like a profound taoist beauty. Her blood type is O with negative Rh. Her birthday is the 16 th of April, so she is thirteen years old. She lived in Hokkaido until the age of ten. Currently she is a runaway because of personal reasons. Together with her two years older step-brother, she moved to Kyoto. She's a vegetarian who doesn't eat meat. She hates tobacco fumes more than anything. Her hobby is killing lower forms of life. Her preferred spot is the Kamogawa park (obviously, her targets are the ducks and pigeons). As she is a runaway, she doesn't go to middle school, however her intellectual curiosity seems normal for her age and she goes to the library everyday.</p>
<p class="null-p">----that was Yamiguchi Houko's profile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if the nonsense user big brother actually lives at the hospital and just sometimes comes to the apartment to play."</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan said so while peeling an apple with her hands that were used to handling butterfly knives. The detached peel fell in a golden bowl placed on her white thighs. Houko-chan was wearing a red dress with sandals, really making it feel like it was the height of summer. She wasn't wearing any accessories and it was a simple fashion overall, but it wasn't because of her lack of sense, it's just that Houko-chan has an overprotective brother. However, looking at Houko-chan who was sitting and a steel pipe chair, it seems that simplicity suits her better than if she dressed strangely, and it's not like I don't understand Moeta-kun's feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's no exaggeration to say that you're an older brother who spends half his life on the bed in this hospital room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's an exaggeration. Don't talk about people like they have a frail body." "Even if you say that, since the nonsense using big brother came to Kyoto, this is the fifth time you went to the hospital."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only five times in six month. That's not that many."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it a lot?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's frequent."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the meanwhile, Houko-chan finished peeling the apple that was as red as her lips. What I understood while looking at her hands was that the trick to peel apples was to hold the knife firmly, and instead make the apple rotate. I thought that she was going to give me that apple, but Houko-chan just continued to peel the apple.</p>
<p class="null-p">August the twenty second-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Originally I should have been working today.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was hospitalized in a hospital in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, I was unconscious until yesterday. According to the doctor, I was seriously wandering the boundary between life and death. Today I finally regained my consciousness, so visits became possible, and the first one to pay me a visit was Houko-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, how long will this time's hospitalisation period be?" "Two months until complete recovery…….one month until being discharged."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you will spend half of summer vacation in the hospital."</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan chuckled. Even though normally she is an honest and good girl, why does she sometimes say such strange and cheeky things? "…...Well, that would be it." I admitted reluctantly. "But it seems there won't be lasting e ects. The broken bones and the detached bones are just simple fractures. There's no dietary restrictions either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan observed me from my head all the way to my toes as if licking my body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, it's too funny."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say it so clearly……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It lacks too much elegance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say it so indirectly……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Casts on both my arms and legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">A corset on my chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gauze on my face.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's how I look currently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Needless to say, it was too ugly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still…..after having had my body injured to such a limit, to have no lasting e ects he's really a professional killer with perfect aftercare. Even though he broke my bones mercilessly here and there, my nerves weren't damaged at all, and my Achilles tendon stuck back perfectly too, so the problem was only the internal injuries, but that too wasn't serious enough that an operation had to be done. That doesn't change the fact that I had been wandering between life and death, but in this case that's probably appropriate.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, I had five ribs left.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was sleepy last time, so I didn't get to hear the details, but, big brother, what exactly happened this month?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…" Was it because she was sleepy? "Well, there were various things, a lot happened. Did you hear about Hime-chan? Yeah, but with my hospitalization, everything got resolved for now---"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. Then it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">While talking, Houko-chan continued making progress with the apple. Unlike radishes, apples have a lot of water so it requires more skill to peel, but Houko-chan wasn't even looking at her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is everyone at the apartment doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As usual. Putting Hime-nee-sama aside, big brother going to the hospital is an ordinary thing, so it doesn't a ect our daily life at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see…..I got one bad news and one good news."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's hear the good news."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mii-nee-san got the scroll she wanted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?" I asked back without thinking. That's right, you could say that was the cause of everything. "---How? Did she find a good job? No, getting such a convenient job that quickly----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She won the lottery."</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan said without any emotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Third prize, 500 thousand yen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">That reminds me, she said something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a thing. It's optimistic, or she has good luck, or how should I say it, there was no need for me to do anything. No, that's false. It's not like that. In other words…….it means that, from the beginning, Miiko-san would have gotten that scroll no matter what happened. No matter how the flow was twisted, no matter what a side character like me did, in the end it had coherence, and it reached its destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of story.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that Miiko-san's story?</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely……</p>
<p class="null-p">For that person, that kind of story is appropriate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something the matter? Nonsense using big brother. You have a face like you are thinking about something." "No, not really. And the bad news?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Kasugai-san, she left the apartment last night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?" I'm a little surprised. "Wasn't she supposed to move to</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan's room? That person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows……..it seemed useless to try to stop her, big brother was in a coma so I couldn't inform you, so I let her do what she wanted. …….Should I have stopped her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No….." I shook my head. "That's the kind of person she is. It's a little regrettable that I wasn't able to say goodbye to her, but there's nothing we can do. She only goes in the direction the wind is blowing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a message from Kasugai-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'I will never forget the sweetness of the nights we spent together'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, she left while harassing me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'The sweetness of the nights', what does that mean? Did something happen between Kasugai-san and big brother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm……."</p>
<p class="null-p">What are you saying to kids, you parasite.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't ever come again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, why did she even come here…….for having stayed one month, she didn't really do anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to think that deeply about it. She just purely wanted to play in the company of big brother, didn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that's the case then 'with big brother' is a mistake."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without paying any mind to my argument, she continued. "Because big brother is popular with abnormal people." It was a hard point to deny, so I just let it slide with "Maybe, maybe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then that would mean she's quite cute, Kasugai-san. Disappearing while big brother is in the hospital. In the same sense, Hime-nee-sama was probably like that too. Because Hime-nee-sama wasn't half-assed with big brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Ah, no, no, that's false. Hime-chan said she had someone she liked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? What's with that weird gap?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nothing. Anyway, nonsense using big brother. So again, there's one room left open."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…..Hime-chan's room was originally Ukigumo-san's room, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Or was it Nanananami's?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I remember correctly, Ukigumo-san was Hime-nee-sama's predecessor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that right……..I wonder who's going to come next."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will probably stay empty for a while. Moeta and I are gonna use it e ectively."</p>
<p class="null-p">After having made the body of the apple quite slim, Houko-chan finally stopped her hands. She closed the knife with a snap and put it in her dress's pocket after spinning it. Then she took the peel that had piled up in the bowl, and brought it to her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">…….so you're gonna eat it?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, nonsense using big brother, leave the apartment to me and use this as an opportunity to slowly heal." Houko-chan laughed creepily while eating the slippery apple('s peel). "I will visit you again when I'm free."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, nonsense using big brother. I heard it from Mii-nee-san, but that hair, you had Hime-nee-same cut it for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Yeah. Sorry for cutting it without telling you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not something that can be resolved with just an apology."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't forgive me.</p>
<p class="null-p">No mercy, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It will quickly grow again anyway…..next time I will ask</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-san. I'm fast at growing hair. Since way back. When I was about your age, it had grown enough to reach my hips. I had it in a thick braid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wasn't interested.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems she didn't like men who talk about their past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the food."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having eaten the apple and the peel in the bowl, Houko-chan stood up from the chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, nonsense using big brother, I plan to stop by the library on my way back so I should go now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. Be careful on the way home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will come visit you again tomorrow or the day after. At that time, do you want me to bring the books you like-----Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right,"she said. Houko-chan took o the knapsack she was carrying and put it on the chair. She then searched inside and took out a paper bag of about the size of a hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here. It seems it's a present from the big sister witch to the nonsense using big brother. I completely forgot I had it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That doesn't sound like Nanananami.</p>
<p class="null-p">While tilting my head and being cautious, I opened the paper bag. What was inside was a machine di erent from what I had seen until now. A black body. However it's not a sturdy material, it seemed kind of cheap. It had a screen and buttons on both sides. Hmm, from the size and how it looks, it's probably a portable game console or something like that, but there was no place to put a cartridge in. No, after looking further at it, it seems there is some kind of card reader at the top. Does it read the information from the card here?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this? It's not an Advance…...is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a Barcode Battler. It seems to be the most hip and popular item among the kids right now. Umm, that console is the second version."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Barcode……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To put it simply, you scan cards in that slit and depending on the number's power level, they will fight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. These days weird things are getting popular…...I absolutely didn't know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also didn't know. But you know, the witch big sister is sensitive to these trends."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true. I don't like praising her but I must at least admit that." I took a good look at the frame. "But the fact there are fights means that it is a game for two people, right? It seems to have that style, so I can't play it in a private room. And I can't really play with the doctors."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She said you can also play alone. Here, I have the game manual." Houko-chan took out another bundle of paper. It was handwritten, so it must not be the original manual. It seemed to be Nanananami's own creation (that freak). "It's apparently a big boom that is turning over the world, so it's quite a hard toy to get. She said that you needed to thank her." "She really doesn't change……..even if the world was destroyed, regardless of how the Story turned out, she would really just say 'I don't care about that'. Not wanting to become like that is natural, but you're also forbidden from respecting her."</p>
<p class="null-p">But well, this is certainly not bad material for killing time. I was thinking about passing this month by just reading books, but playing with this for a bit might not be bad. Even though I can't say anything about the game while</p>
<p class="null-p">I have not read the manual.</p>
<p class="null-p">………It won't explode or anything, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onee-san also proposed another console called the Virtual Boy, but apparently 'It's too new for Inosuke so he probably won't be able to use it.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. She really talks about me like I'm late on trends."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I will go now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan said this and put back her bag on her back,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ya--ho--n!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the hospital room, the sliding door facing my bed opened with incredible force and the nurse carrying a tray with my food entered the hospital room like a skilled waitress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I~i~, It's been a long time, it's time for your food!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" "…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's I~i~'s favorite, hospital food!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" "…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I definitely don't eat hospital food because I like it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, even you're gonna reappear?</p>
<p class="null-p">That was unexpected.</p>
<p class="null-p">The nurse, who was wearing her clearly rule breaking uniform as usual, with her short skirt and white stockings, approached the bed and, with a flowing movement, put the tray on the table. She was someone that is foolish in both appearance and on the inside, but at least she did her job e ciently. As one would expect from someone wearing glasses (irrelevant</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it has really been a long time. I~i~ didn't come to the hospital for two whole months so Onee-san was worried about what you were doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...that is in itself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you for that, really.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being worried about me not coming to the hospital.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Oh dear, oh dear. I~i~ must not be underestimated, nya-. That--" The nurse looked sharply at Houko-chan who had suddenly frozen because of the intruder (more precisely, Houko-chan one hand in the pocket of her dress and entered into combat preparation). "That's quite a cute lady that came to visit you! Uwa, really cute! What is this girl?! I~i~, that's not fair! With that loli-girl! In this room which only has one bed! In this locked room, what were you two doing all alone until now?! Ah really, you Humbert</p>
<p class="null-p">Humbert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Do I really have to deal with this high tension pervert even during my hospitalization?</p>
<p class="null-p">Using my arms that were hard to move because of my cast, I reached towards the bowl of food. The situation with my legs is quite delicate so I shouldn't move them, but the broken bones in my arms were around my elbow so as long as I restrain myself, it shouldn't impact my daily life. "Kyaa, really pretty--! Truly lyrical! Little miss, what's your name? Tell it to Onee-san please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yamiguchi Houko" Houko-chan said and slightly bowed her head. She took her hand away from her pocket, so it seems she lessened her caution.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for the praise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nya? Yamiguchi?" The nurse tilted her head. "…..Nyan. How should I say, it's very characteristic. It's a strange name. Are you sure it's not Sekiguchi? Well, you're cute so I forgive you. Hey, hey, Houko-chan, what's your relationship with that unfriendly big brother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sex friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">I spurted out the miso soup that I was about to drink.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even that nurse was frozen.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time in that hospital room was frozen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, wait…………..calm down, become calm. This phenomenon…….it may be the attack of an enemy stand!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan tilted her head mysteriously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Houko-chan…….I want you to forgive this weakling and coward for answering a question with another question, but that vocabulary, in which dungeon did you acquire it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The witch big sister taught it to me. If someone were to ask what my relationship is with big brother, I should answer like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I thought, it's that witch.</p>
<p class="null-p">I will need to settle that with her someday.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it bad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…….very much." I shook my head without any strength. "Because I technically have a life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but don't worry," Houko-chan laughed. "I have only said that to about ten people."</p>
<p class="null-p">My life…….</p>
<p class="null-p">My life…….where is it going?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Houko-chan. I say this for your good, you shouldn't use unfamiliar words carelessly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ok. However, from now on, how should I deal with this kind of question?" "Well obviously, since we have not done anything weird, you can just answer normally and say 'we're friends'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We did it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I-it's impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strictly speaking, I should have not done anything unethical or perverse with Houko-chan. Since I'm the type to keep the dessert until the end…..wait, that's not it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan laughed mischievously at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected of the witch big sister. The plan for big brother to call me a friend worked perfectly. I'm really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then. If there is anything I can do, please call me anytime."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, she passed by me and the nurse (who was still frozen) and went towards the door. Having slid the door open, she turned back,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, and also," she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I at least know what sex means. I may have no experience, but I'm still a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, good health, friendship and reunion."</p>
<p class="null-p">Houko-chan went out into the hallway and the door automatically slid back and closed. The hospital room went back to being plunged in silence. Eventually the nurse picked up her cap that had fallen o and fixed the position of her glasses, and after shrugging,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was deceived."</p>
<p class="null-p">She twisted her lips and looked at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's really cute, that girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….well, yes she is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like she will die next month."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a severely serious story.</p>
<p class="null-p">The nurse sat down on the chair that Houko-chan had been sitting on while saying "Heave-ho".</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, I~i~, it's been a long time-----did you become more manly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Is that sarcasm because half of my face is covered in gauze?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's not that. Your demeanour became more manly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me see----yes." I answered jokingly. "Well, I overcame the death of a comrade and grew as a person I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heen."</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't seem to care.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems she just wanted to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? What happened? What's with this silence?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it a mating signal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ummm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, let's see.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's embarrassing and bothersome but I have no choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well it's like a ritual.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even something trivial seems valuable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miss nurse, are you fine with the usual quiz?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Yeah, it's fine. What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a very curious face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right, it's better to let someone else do the stu you don't like.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The time is a night long ago, the place is somewhere not here, for reasons five person gather there----"</p>
<p class="null-p">I briefly explained this case's circumstances to the nurse. The straitjacket under the manteau, the double personality of the professional killer and the great detective, the siblings with one as a pair, a pair as one. The bodyguard string technique user. The girl who won't die, the accompanying assistant professor. And, an incompetent nonsense user. When he woke up in the morning, four of them were dead-----only one survived.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pathetically, he survived.</p>
<p class="null-p">He lived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Ummm. This time's quiz is not a locked room. Aaaaah, boring."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it boring?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Because recently, I've become a locked room enthusiast."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They call me the woman who remembers the number of locked rooms she read. Well it's fine, umm." The nurse held her head a moment. This time, it seems she was a little troubled. "And, this pathetic and uncool idiot who survived, he's not the killer, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't use such horrible terms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm--. Hmmm. Without any outsiders?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Without any."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then there's only one answer." The nurse said bluntly. "It wasn't a double personality but twins, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Correct."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If they're twins, essentially they possess the same body , so it's simple to perform as someone with a double personality, isn't it? If they're skilled,it's to the extent that it won't be seen through at first. If you think that two people possess the same body , then there's nothing as useful as that for detectives and professional killers. Even for the straitjacket and the manteau, even if it's impossible to do it alone, with two you can change clothes anytime. That means there's no problem with driving the bike. And also, that string technique user, even if she's a strong girl, even if you can't win against her in a one on one, with a two on one the chances become better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…….that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the Niounomiya siblings of massacre magic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Niounomiya------siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu the Carnival and Izumu the Man Eater .</p>
<p class="null-p">The naming is also----a trick.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since male and female identical twins are impossible, if they appear with the same body, you will end up believing their word. Even</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun--------he said big brother but his body is the same as</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan's, it doesn't change the fact that it's the body of a little girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">The double personality is in itself the fake.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had never imagined something like making it seem that two people were in fact a double personality, but if you simply think about it, it's something that has many advantages beyond what the nurse just said. First is the body double. If Rizumu-chan is on the front------then Izumu-kun will be at the back and he could sneak around freely. And that's not all. If Rizumu-chan managed the weak body, there's also an unavoidable sense of bad taste.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun talked about Rizumu-chan like a puppet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Puppet (alternative).</p>
<p class="null-p">Remplacement (alternative).</p>
<p class="null-p">Body double (alternative).</p>
<p class="null-p">'The double personality was twins------if you exclude that point, the rest is generally the same as Izumu's explanation, I think' That's what Aikawa-san said in the discussion. 'Furthermore…….like the Fragment Ichihime talked about, Izumu can probably remote control Rizumu. That would explain what happened that night by the stairs.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Right------</p>
<p class="null-p">A by-product of 'Fragment', she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">The empty Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hollow Rizumu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">A puppet.</p>
<p class="null-p">An autonomous radio control.</p>
<p class="null-p">That…..wasn't a metaphor, that wasn't pretending or self-concealing, it had exactly that meaning. The personality given to that body was cruelly and arbitrarily, lacking. Furthermore, it was following Izumu-kun's will.</p>
<p class="null-p">Controlled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that night.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a puppet.</p>
<p class="null-p">A temporary personality provided to a puppet.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the extent she held no question towards her consciousness vanishing, or towards the clothes she was wearing under the manteau, she was hopelessly lacking and programmed with the bare minimum personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't even Sharaku Hosuke.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Niounomiya professional killer rejecting all kinds of weakness and specializing in absolute strength , Niounomiya Rizumu was the spare for that. The caretaker of the spare body------Niounomiya Rizumu. The reason</p>
<p class="null-p">why Izumu-kun sympathized so much with Rizumu-chan has become clear to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although…….in that fight, one of the two died."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be it. But like that it all adds up. The truth is that there were six people and two survived, so the uncool and pathetic idiot doesn't have to be the culprit. In that adjacent hospital room was, of course, the corpse of the spare little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">The beheaded corpse of Rizumu-chan. That was Hime-chan's String technique . The one who pierced a hole in her chest------and took her heart was probably Izumu-kun, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">Heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rizumu-chan's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The proof of being alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Making it seem like two people were in fact a double personality, would certainly not be that hard to see through for the Strategist, Hagihara Shiogi -----that's why it was a condition that Shiogi-chan and the Niounomiya siblings didn't fight directly------- knowing about the Niounomiya siblings even without fighting them directly-----however, in this exceptional case, that kind of trick would be di cult to see through for most people, including me, unless if it were accidentally used in a way that greatly deviated from its intended use.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is simple, and thus di cult to solve.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not logic.</p>
<p class="null-p">What you need is a leap in logic.</p>
<p class="null-p">An idea to overcome the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's-------not process of elimination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having said that, that doesn't mean the trick the Niounomiya siblings played with was excellent. Rather, it's the opposite.</p>
<p class="null-p">An ephemeral work.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a hopelessly ephemeral work.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, well said.</p>
<p class="null-p">I organized the clients of the professional killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">I will wear the fourteen crosses on my body and I will now carry out my mission.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Massacre Magic Group, the Niounomiya's Performing Arts group-----------</p>
<p class="null-p">What exactly-----do they think of humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, in the first place, multiple personalities are not that recognized in medicine. Well, that professional killer thinks his partner died. Now, if I leave this corpse and run away somewhere, I'll be free! Since he normally passes for someone with a double personality, only a few would know of his existence, probably only his relatives. To the world, it means that he died , so he can enter a secluded lifestyle. Even if it meant leaving behind his sister's corpse-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The heart is always near, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The truth is probably not that romantic. Izumu-kun was not the kind of person to like that kind of delusion. If we told him that, he would probably just laugh in our face. If it was only that it'd be fine, but knowing</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun, he might get angry.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----not everything is calculated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Izumu-kun lost his sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she was just a replacement for the system, for Izumu-kun she was not just a replacement, I know that because he called out to me in the courtyard even though he risked to collapse that entire system.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sure at that time, Izumu-kun was</p>
<p class="null-p">Bored.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of killing.</p>
<p class="null-p">And probably of living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah----that's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps for Izumu-kun that action was just something he thought of in the moment. Maybe it was the kind of ephemeral and brittle thing you didn't think of the second before and end up forgetting the second after, that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, if we pin it down, it's just that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like that. The information in this quiz was somewhat lacking, so it's impossible to determine the details, but anything can be done about that. Setting that aside, for starters, it's something like that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……..as expected of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ta-dah, the nurse stuck out her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">I ended up making her in a good mood, huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry, I have work, work. I-i-, is that all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, well, yes. I don't have much appetite."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess. Then, I will clean that up." The nurse promptly returned the bowl to the trail. "Well then, best regards for the whole month, I-i-."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">One month.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's a freezing thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a situation where I can barely move, having that pervert hold the right to my life and death……..</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Um, miss nurse (in training)."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey I'm a nurse (registered). I will sue you for sexual harassment." "Your name, won't you tell it to me? With you…….I think it will be a long relationship."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? You didn't know? When we first met I thought I gave it to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe I heard it but I have forgotten."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a bad memory you have."</p>
<p class="null-p">The nurse crossed her arms as if she was fed up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine. My name is Katanashi Rabumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Katanashi------Rabu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rabumi. Hihi, it's a feminine name, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…….yes, it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, it's not a humanlike name.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't think it's the name of someone who will stay a side character.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Your parents, what were they doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh--? Wait wait, that's shameless. If you want to know details about me, you have to enter the hospital route and advance on the Rabumi scenario."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no such thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kamaitachi no Yoru?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up idiot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nyahaha-! Well then-"</p>
<p class="null-p">After the nurse put her hand on her chest and took the pose of a hero of justice, she slid the door and left the hospital room.</p>
<p class="null-p">………………….</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometimes I wonder if there are only crazy people in this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every one of them is crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ill, broken</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably from the structure itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe I have to think it's that kind of story and give up-------it's a cruelly absurd story."</p>
<p class="null-p">For example if you take Miiko-san's case, you reap what you sow, maybe that's none other than karma.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I'm crazy, everyone around me is crazy. Because I'm the worst, everyone around me is the worst. As if a compass with the wrong coordinates could draw a correct map.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miiko-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should I do about Miiko-san?</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't go back to the apartment for a while…...that's a somewhat ugly story.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she came to visit me what kind of face should I make?</p>
<p class="null-p">An unsightly appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">An unsightly result.</p>
<p class="null-p">Disgraceful.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, there are limits to being unsightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Izumu-kun…….I wonder what happened to him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's been three days.</p>
<p class="null-p">Death Colored Crimson VS Man Eater.</p>
<p class="null-p">The result of that had already come out long ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">He said he was bored of killing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being trained as a killer-----a personality created to be a killer, is it really possible? For a weapon that was created only to kill, only to massacre, a change of heart, is it possible?</p>
<p class="null-p">……...I'm sure it's possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">There are some who get bored of living.</p>
<p class="null-p">There are some who get bored of themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">There are some who forget they are living.</p>
<p class="null-p">There are some who want to forget they are living.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were probably some who didn't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan-----what about her?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was I able to remember correctly?</p>
<p class="null-p">My meeting with Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">I met Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">There, I think there was only that meaning. Without substitution, I think there was only that meaning. But, even if that's the case for me, what about Hime-chan? For Hime-chan, did meeting me have any meaning? By meeting me, did she change? Did the fact that she met me and no one other than me have a meaning for her?</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan often cried in front of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I often hurt Hime-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unconsciously, but sometimes intentionally.</p>
<p class="null-p">I, for that, was I able to give her something?</p>
<p class="null-p">In return, was I able to do something?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know but.</p>
<p class="null-p">-------'Surprisingly, it's something that I don't know myself.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Hime-chan's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see, it's weird to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly-----exquisite.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, maybe I won't know for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for this matter alone, the reliable contractor that makes her appearance at the very end and gives the answer to everything won't appear. Because it's my problem, my question, and my own opponent, it's best to answer it myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I'm sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since that June------Hime-chan had been living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then that means my existence was not useless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Me and Hime-chan meeting was not useless.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was salvation.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Izumu-kun says, she, Yukariki Ichihime, she may have killed too many to live----that may also be, you reap what you sow, karma-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Yukariki Ichihime was living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her own story.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..her own, her own and only her story, huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Story.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm, that word.</p>
<p class="null-p">I remembered the words of the man with the fox mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this case, he was wandering around on the outer frame from the beginning to the end. In the end, he didn't step into the center of the Story. While having a deep connection with Assistant Professor Kigamine,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kuchiha-chan, Rizumu-chan and Izumu-kun, the man with the fox mask didn't have anything to do with the case. Unlike me, he who was satisfied from start to finish by being an observer. While being the cause and directing the stage------</p>
<p class="null-p">He who was satisfied just by knowing the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the two Cannibals ……even these existences, he who only thought of them as an e ective and replaceable cause. He who thought of even the undying girl as something transient.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aikawa-san's, huh…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's an unusual story but--------it's not unthinkable. Rather, it makes a lot of sense if I think about it. The similarity between the two that made you feel the distortion, and also the di erences between the two that made you feel the distortion.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I have not yet told that to Aikawa-san. Even when we met in the</p>
<p class="null-p">Kyoto Imperial Palace I forcefully did not touch on that area. In front of</p>
<p class="null-p">Aikawa-san, the existence of the fox masked man was completely erased. It's not like I was putting on airs, it's not like I was feeling guilty from touching Aikawa-san's past without her consent. But even then, the man with the fox mask's existence, the fact that I knew him, I didn't tell a word about it to Aikawa-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">More than feeling guilt, I felt disgust for myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, no matter what, I couldn't say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not that I didn't say it, I couldn't say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was-----just scared.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fox masked man.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was just scared of that man.</p>
<p class="null-p">That abnormality, and no matter what faces he has-----</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't want to get involved.</p>
<p class="null-p">My enemy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he has declared that, I wonder if that fox masked man has something laid out for me. If that's the case, should I accept his challenge? It's too much, this, it's too ridiculous. Even if he said that it's the Story's plot, I really can't accept it.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a fear like death.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder how we should should face each other --------</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I wonder what will happen from now on……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">No one changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Myself not changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not being involved with anyone or anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought it would be nice if I could just spend time lazily.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that kind of thing is impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Living is a series of changes and transformations.</p>
<p class="null-p">A series of ramifications and complications, converging towards death.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm not alive enough to get tired of living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, I was tired of dying</p>
<p class="null-p">The Story doesn't matter too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, since that's all it is----</p>
<p class="null-p">We are alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bye bye.</p>
<p class="null-p">Farewell.</p>
<p class="null-p">Goodnight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do not eat, need we say more?" is the END. AFTERWORD---------</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, perhaps if I continue to live, I will die?" I think that every human has been confronted with this question, but as a relatively young book author, I had bumped into this question, "Absurd absurd, there's no way people die!", and with that stupid conclusion I had closed the question. And, it's natural, but humans can die. One day they will die for sure. It feels like 'what are you saying' but it seems it's already decided. It's not even decent. It's not a joke. Even if the person in charge came out, that person in charge will eventually die. No matter how much you stretch out your life expectancy or how much you lower the probability of death, day by day, living through a day in itself is like augmenting the probability of death apparently. So, if there was a box where inside there were winning lottery tickets, and the ratio between winning and losing was about forty thousand to one, so that even if you drew one per day you would still end up losing. Even then, the fact that, day by day, people are living with unreliable and unfounded ways to win like "the tickets on that side seem to be winning ones" or "the ones on the top aren't mixed so they are dangerous", and mere consolations like "normally you don't draw that kind of thing" is something sad. When you die you will die even if you get hit by a meteorite. Lottery is a gamble, but if the probabilities to earn are low enough then it's no longer gambling, or something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Further talk would just be sloppy and have no correlation with the characters appearing in this book, but the key person of the book, Madoka Kuchiha, is an immortal girl. Even if it's a first person narrator, since it's also written elsewhere, it's ninety nine percent certainly true. But if the parts under the words of established 'life and death' aren't steady, then I'm worried even though it's other people's a airs. Well, if you were to say that the Niounomiya siblings are just an entity that divides in two parts the strength and weakness that was originally one, to begin with they are just bridges that failed to lead the narrator that is the nonsense using protagonist to death and they aren't even living properly, it seems like only characters whose problem aren't things like living or dying are appearing, it's not like the book is not wobbling, really I don't know what karma led to things ending up like this, but like that the last boss appeared, it was</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cannibal Magical : The Niounomiya siblings of magical massacre".</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, as for editor in-charge Ooda Katsushi-sama and illustrator in-charge Take-san, I would like to do the usual acknowledgments, but I'm beginning to run out of variations of how to thank them. I no longer know what to say, but even if I run out of words to thank them with , my feeling of gratitude won't run out. So that the love for my readers doesn't run out, this unworthy me will continue to write decent texts. Well then if we have a connection, I would like to see you again.</p>
