<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Then how about we go out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Keiki couldn't understand the meaning of those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was in the student council office, after classes had ended, and the words that Shiho spoke while standing in front of him were enough to greatly shake the young man's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's this about?! Why would Takasaki-senpai…?!</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't just him. Any boy would cease to function after being asked that by a beauty of Shiho's level. Naturally, the situation left him confused, but there was no way he could just keep quiet forever. Hence, he decided to question the girl's intentions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"G-Go out… W-W-W-What are you impwawying wiff that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He bit his tongue. Really hard, too, which made him unable to speak properly. The young Keiki obviously completely failed at keeping calm. Indeed, he was immediately lost to panic. Ignoring the flub, the young girl watched her Kouhai panicking and threw him another bone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly what I said? A boy-girl relationship, a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, that kind of stuff. I meant that sort of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, any boy his age would jump in joy after being told that by a girl like her, and would start thanking the heavens. However, the boy named Kiryuu Keiki was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">This has to be some sort of trap, right?!</p>
<p class="null-p">What was filling his heart wasn't joy, but suspicion. For what reason? It was simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, every time Keiki had thought that his own personal spring of life would arrive, and got a good mood going with a beautiful girl, it always went down the pervert route, and it stabbed him in the back. After being deceived countless times, he had lost the ability to put trust in these ever-so-sweet sounding words. The only thought that was going through his mind now was "I'll go through hell again, for sure." These were the words of fear. Like a beast would be wary about traps, he reflexively put himself on guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… is this some kind of joke?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wouldn't joke about something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Keiki's question, the student council president puffed out her lips and pouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's with that cute reaction?! If you make that kind of face, even I will get my hopes up, you know?! I'll really think that my popularity has finally arrived, okay?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Still wary, the boy asked yet another bold question. "S-So then, did you f-f-f-fall for me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I certainly don't hate you, but if I had to say, it's probably a no, I guess~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But there was now another question that had to be asked and answered. "Then why did you suddenly bring that up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The smile on the girl's face disappeared. So did her cheerful mood and the nice atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit hard to say…" "Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like… Someone has been watching me all the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I walk down the hallway, on my way home from school… I can feel a presence that's always behind my back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you're saying that it's a stalker?" "Ahaha, I guess that's what it boils down to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that pretty dangerous? I don't think that you should laugh about that sort of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was indeed a stalker, there were several possibilities as to what he could be doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">First, it might just be the persistent admirer. They might start wiretapping and other measures to check on her daily life. In the worst case, they might even resort to violence. In a certain sense, Koharu was a good-willed stalker, although Keiki still couldn't exactly praise her for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing is, I've never seen the stalker's face, but it just feels like someone has been following me, and I can feel their gaze on me… and I've just been too scared to check…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she might not have definite proof, just because there's no smoke doesn't mean that there can't be a fire. When you considered Shiho's beauty and friendly personality, Keiki could imagine that she had a lot of secret admirers that held one-sided feelings towards her. The possibility wasn't low</p>
<p class="null-p">that one of them would reach a point where he wouldn't be able to hold himself back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But wouldn't it be better to ask a teacher for help instead of me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, it might very well just be my imagination, and there hasn't been any apparent damage yet, so I don't want to turn this into that big of a deal just yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand where you're coming from, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If even the existence of said stalker couldn't be guaranteed, she couldn't exactly give proof. Since she was the student council president, spreading groundless rumours would only hurt herself, so Keiki understood her reasoning behind not wanting that to happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As for my reasoning behind asking you out, if this stalker is really determined, then I was thinking that he might give up if I had a boyfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's what it was about."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki himself thought that a confession out of the blue like that was way too absurd, but now he understood why she had done so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was hoping that you could pretend to be my boyfriend for a while." "Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A fake boyfriend might definitely help make this potential stalker give up. But it would mean that they would start dating, although just on the outside. Circumstances were circumstances, but Keiki didn't feel right deceiving everyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-kun… Do you hate me?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you hate me that much, that you won't even play along to help me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not really it, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That way of phrasing things was more than unfair in Keiki's eyes. Her saddened expression, and the way she was looking up at him, every part of it was foul play. As her ultimate attack, the Senpai took the hesitating boy's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please! In return, during the time we're pretending like this, I'll act like your real girlfriend! You want to experience what it's like to have a cute girlfriend, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">"A real girlfriend…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun is the only one I can ask for this." "Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Setting aside the wonderful favour she had offered, it was true that the girl looked really troubled by this. Ignoring her request was not something that Keiki could allow himself to do. In her case, what she needed was probably more of a bodyguard than a boyfriend anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I'll help you." "Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Plus, this is the perfect chance to repay you for the club budget thing, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho assertively shook Keiki's hand with hers. Keiki felt himself blushing ever so slightly from the softness he felt. Although he thought that he had gotten used to his sort of contact thanks to the continuous approaches from perverted girls, Keiki couldn't help but be a bit nervous while being touched by the other sex like this.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: I'd like to borrow a boyfriend</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day after he became Shiho's fake boyfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">4th period ended, and as soon as the English teacher had stepped out of the classroom, Mao came walking over Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, Kiryuu, Akiyama, how about we eat lunch together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was resting on his English workbook and notes on the table, and Akiyama was doing the same. In response,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Mao-chan. I already have plans with Koharu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Declining apologetically, Shouma took his wrapped lunch box and got up from his seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"See you later then," were his last words as he hurriedly stepped out as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Akiyama Shouma was in a relationship with the legal loli Senpai, also known as Ootori Koharu. Hence, they had probably been planning to eat lunch together like a normal couple would, and he would probably be heading to the astronomy clubroom. When Mao saw that he was prioritizing his girlfriend rather than his friends, she let out a poisonous response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch, even though I wanted to draw Kiryuu and Shouma as they'd feed each other some wieners."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. It would've never come to that, even if he stayed with us." "Then how about we skip that and you both start nibbling on each other's</p>
<p class="null-p">thick frankfurters-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Calm down there. You shouldn't say any more than that."</p>
<p class="null-p">This certainly wasn't an appropriate thing for a girl to say in the middle of a classroom, and during lunch break of all times. When Keiki stopped her out of consideration to other people, Mao still let out a "Hmph" snort, and her side-tail shook.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akiyama has totally turned bad after he got a girlfriend." "Well, you'd normally prioritize your lover after all." Even Keiki would pick a lover over his friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that Master is cute and all, but at this rate, I really will start running out of material here, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hearing that doesn't bother me anymore, but that's as irrational of an argument as you can come up with."</p>
<p class="null-p">And the accusation was pretty extreme as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">As an aside, the 'Master' here was referring to Koharu. Ever since she helped Mao out of a slump, she became something of a shoujo manga teacher for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I'd complain about it. Not getting enough material is a life-or- death situation for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about you just go searching for another models and release us from this agony already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible. There's no other delish pairing that I could use for my research."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say pairing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you help me get some material, I'll pay you like a part-time job would.</p>
<p class="null-p">How about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll probably ask me to take off my underwear on the first day, so I humbly decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, this was all about the fact that Mao created R18 BL manga and doujins. Hence, Keiki would probably end up as a nude model one day if he were to accept here. He had no particular interest in showing a female classmate his naked body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine if they're both happy. So then, how about we eat lunch together with just the two of us, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry. Today doesn't really work for me." "Oh, do you have business elsewhere?" "Yeah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking Mizuha's wrapped home-made lunch out of his bag, Keiki also got up from his seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. I can't have them wait for me." "Ah, hey, Kiryuu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not listening to Mao telling him to stop, Keiki quickly left the classroom. While the boy left, Mao muttered a complaint.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What was that about? Hmph."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma having a girlfriend was one thing, but Keiki even…</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded like he was meeting someone, so does he have some meeting with another girl from the calligraphy club?</p>
<p class="null-p">But then there'd be no reason to hide it. In that case, maybe he was going to have lunch with another girl not from the club-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There's no way, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking thus far, Mao decided to abandon that thought. She couldn't believe that someone would actually date a boring guy like him, so she gave up on dwelling on it. It sounded way too ridiculous. However, the lingering doubt inside her wouldn't disappear that easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the classroom behind him, Keiki's legs brought him to the first floor of the school building. Obviously, he was going to meet Shiho, who he had decided to help. Since she was the student council president, it should be as clear as day that she was a very busy person. She would hand out jobs to the other student council members, like sorting papers and making preparations, as well as having negotiations with teachers about various things. Knowing that, it made sense that she wouldn't have much time once classes ended, so their first rendezvous was set to take place during lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki arrived at their meeting place in the courtyard, Shiho, who was sitting on a bench, noticed him, and waved at him with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for making you wait." "I just arrived myself, so it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This exchange really makes us feel like lovers, doesn't it?" "Ahaha, I thought the same."</p>
<p class="null-p">The ball the Kouhai threw was returned with a gentle smile by the girl. And right now, it was Keiki's job to protect that very smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I'm leaving the lovey-dovey acting to you, Keiki-kun." "Leave it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Understanding the expectations that had been placed upon him, Keiki nodded with determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since this is to repel the stalker, let's get lovey-dovey as much as we can!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, this wasn't a lunch to meet the beautiful Senpai or anything. This was one of the opening moves to work against the stalker who was pursuing said girl. That being said, the idea was more than simple. Act like Takasaki Shiho's lover, that was all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Against that perpetrator, Keiki and Shiho would be going out like this, and their hope was that the person would give up on her. Hence, they decided to start by sitting next to each other like this, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that feels a bit too far, I think." When she pointed that out, Keiki… "Is this better?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… a bit more… Just a bit… Yeah, like this. This feels better." After being told to do several retakes, he was given an OK.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But isn't this crazy close?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're lovers, right? Something like this is normal, I tell you," said the girl as she gave him a satisfied smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Between both of them, there was close to no space left. Though Keiki felt slightly flustered as a result, he understood that this was necessary for their act. Now that their positions were solidified, it was time to move to the next stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">They both had their lunch boxes on standby already. They started eating their lunch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're definitely supposed to each lunch together when you're a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're doing that all the time without consideration for the lonely people around them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had the image that couples would be together 24/7. A real couple that Keiki knew of, namely Shouma and Koharu, would eat lunch together almost</p>
<p class="null-p">every day, and they would exchange texts during smaller breaks as well. They would even go home together once classes ended. They demonstrated perfect couple techniques, indeed.</p>
<p class="null-p">If they were to go with those very techniques themselves, Keiki and Shiho would certainly look like lovers to the people around them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your little sister is making your lunch, right, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Since our parents are often out because of their work, she really saves my arse. She's got admirable cooking skill, for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her omurices during the culture festival were really delicious as well. That's pretty amazing. I can make simple things pretty well, but I'm not that good at it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I barely can make anything, so even that's pretty amazing in my eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Frankly, the only things he could make were scrambled eggs and store- bought yakisoba. Hence, when he put one of Mizuha's handmade mini hamburgers in his mouth, it made him once again realize how thankful he was for Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just thinking. Just eating lunch normally doesn't make you feel like a couple all that much, right? It feels more like we're good friends."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The young kids nowadays are moving along even faster than us, so we should be more assertive. We should do something that would make anyone understand that we really are a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai still belongs in the younger generation I think, but… I understand what you're trying to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, there were doing nothing but eating lunch normally. Exactly as Shiho pointed out, this made them look like 'Good friends', and nothing more. They really needed a plan to make them be more couple-y.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what else should we be doing, then?" "How about something like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho used her chopsticks to pick up some omelet from her lunchbox. She held it out towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here. Open wide."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?! Open wide… you say?!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I thought that this definitely would make us look like a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess that makes sense. That's definitely something that couples would do. It's unmistakably a couple-like move."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, there is one fatal flaw with this plan." "And what would that be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm super embarrassed!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem. It's the same for me~" "Ehhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Shiho had no plans to stop there. Not to mention that she seemed to have already realized how much she was troubling Keiki with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The proof was written all over her face. That full-fledged smile of hers. That lovable, yet also detestable grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's definitely enjoying it…</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki already knew it from his time as a temporary member, the student council president was someone who loved to thoroughly enjoy herself. For example, the fact that she kept quiet about Rin being a boy, and only acted like a teasing Onee-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't eat it soon, people will think that something is off." "Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. The stalker might be watching this very moment. If Keiki hesitated here, they might think that something was off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the midst of his conflict, Keiki gazed at the omelet in front of his eyes. This was the courtyard. It was surrounded by the other school buildings, and was a place that a lot of people could see. Doing the 'Open wide' flirting here was definitely super embarrassing… However, this was to protect Shiho from the stalker. To protect her freedom at school. Hence-</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ahhhhnnn…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He ate it. He gulped the omelet down in one go. And he carefully chewed it before he swallowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The taste is delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My mother is really proud of this omelet recipe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like your mother is really good at cooking, Senpai." "Then have some of this fried chicken as well. Here, open wide~" "Ahhhn…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that it's come to this, Keiki gave up and stopped resisting. This time, he immediately accepted the fried chicken. Though it had already gotten cold, it was still extremely juicy, and immensely delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, we definitely look more like a couple now." "It'd be bad if we didn't, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, your face has gotten really red, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyone would end up like like if they shared an indirect kiss with such a</p>
<p class="null-p">beauty of a Senpai." "Eh…? I-Indirect kiss…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Shiho hadn't realized it yet, because her gaze fell to her chopsticks, and her face quickly flushed a deep red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai's face is also bright red, you know." "Don't tease me like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, with their exchange, and their gestures, they looked like a proper couple. Though they were basically just mimicking other couples.</p>
<p class="null-p">I won't get stabbed by that stalker, right…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just by doing this with a beauty of a Senpai like Shiho, he would be the center of a lot of attention. Naturally, that made Keiki worried that the stalker would hold a grudge against him, and target him.</p>
<p class="null-p">No wait, being seen by someone from the calligraphy club right now would probably be just as dangerous…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hadn't thought about that back when he agreed to this. He realized too late that, rather than the stalker, he should probably be more concerned about the other club members. After all, they were perverted girls through and through.</p>
<p class="null-p">One wanted Keiki to become her master, another wanted him to become her slave. They all were targeting Keiki for the most absurd reasons. No doubt the situation would escalate if even one of them were to spot Keiki and Shiho acting as a couple right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">To repel the stalker, standing out was necessary. However, that would also increase the odds of being seen by said perverts. To be fair, it probably was just a matter of time until that worst-case scenario happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the moment Keiki came to that conclusion, something happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cuuuuuurse youuuuuuuu…" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice filled with resentment could be heard from somewhere. When he turned his gaze towards the source of the voice, he locked eyes with the face of a certain person who was peeking out from the shadow of a tree close to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa… We're starting things off immediately, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why does it sound like you're insulting me? Well, this kind of cold gaze is also Keiki-kun's charming point."</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who spoke such a complaint and approval in the same breath was none other than Sayuki. She was the club leader of the pervert-filled calligraphy club, as well as a hardcore masochistic molester herself. Letting her long hair sway in the breeze, she walked towards the bench and crossed her arms, which emphasized her extremely-well-endowed chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to be enjoying yourself, Keiki-kun. What are you doing with Takasaki-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're eating our lunch…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that! I've been watching for a while!" "Ehhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she had the question herself, she became fairly aggravated by the obvious answer. Not to mention that this 'for a while' part sounded rather disconcerting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What I want to know is why you're having lunch together with Takasaki-san here! Not to mention that you were doing that gross 'Open wide~' thing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really were watching us the whole time, huh?" Maybe she herself was the stalker?</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shiho for her part just flashed a teasing smile. "Hmmm? I think I understand now~."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-san, are you jealous? That I was feeding Keiki-kun like that~."</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Even I've experienced that already, you know! We were at an amusement park together, and he fed me his thick, long… that, you know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A frankfurter! I was feeding her a frankfurter!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hurriedly followed up with an explanation before things could go any more south. Shiho probably would have had a terrible misunderstanding if he didn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun's frankfurter was so big that I could barely fit it in my mouth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say things that make it sound worse than it is. Especially not in such an ecstatic tone of voice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki strictly reprimanded the pervert who was about to go crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Keiki-kun, didn't you cut ties with the student council? Since when did you get so close with Takasaki-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that I stopped being a temporary student council member, but I still pop by there from time to time, so eating together shouldn't be that weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki felt like that should be enough to quench her thirst for answers, Sayuki still didn't seem satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But do you really feed each other like that if you're just friends?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… I really think I'm wrong… Considering how Keiki-kun is, this is impossible, but… Are you two… umm… G-Going out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, they weren't. They sure weren't, but they were currently acting as if they were. Not knowing how much he can say, Keiki sent Shiho a "What should we do?" gaze. In response, she calmly nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, Tokihara-san. We're not going out. I just think of him as a cute kouhai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she denied it that straightforwardly, Sayuki let out a breath of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you never know what might happen, though. Since I've taken a liking to him, that fact might chance in the near future."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the same breath however, Shiho's provokation left Sayuki in complete silence. Just when Keiki thought that her shoulders had started shaking, she jumped at Keiki like a dog who was afraid that her owner was going to leave her. She quickly pulled him away from Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't hand over Keiki-kun to someone like you!" "Yeah, this really turned into something bothersome…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging from that exchange and the result, Sayuki would surely continue to see Shiho as an enemy. They are plenty busy with the stalker already, but the conflict with Sayuki would surely not be something that would end just like that, and she might very well obstruct their plans.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're an interesting person, Tokihara-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai, please don't stir up Sayuki-senpai any more."</p>
<p class="null-p">While complaining to the student council president who always did whatever she wanted, and while being hugged tightly by Sayuki, Keiki calmly took a piece of asparagus dipped in sesame sauce and put it in his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sudden interference by Sayuki caused the plan to be put on intermission for an hour. In the end, they weren't able to spot the stalker during that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes ended, Keiki was waiting for someone at the shoe locker near the entrance of the school. He had killed time in the library until the sun started to set, and he stepped out around one hour ago. The smartphone in his hand showed the time was running close to 7pm. He heard light footsteps, and he saw Shiho stepping out of the school building, her job finally complete.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work today, Takasaki-senpai." "Ah, Keiki-kun? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was worried, so I thought that I would escort you home today." "Worried about what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Worried about the stalker. Something bad might happen if you walk home alone at this hour."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, the chances of her being targeted right now weren't negligible. That was why letting her walk outside alone was far too dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you waited all this time for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was reading a book in the library, so it wasn't that big of a deal." "I see. You really are kind," she said as she let out a faint laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I might just be a fake, but I still am Senpai's boyfriend right now." "Then I'll let you take up on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, let's get going."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki was certainly not built like a bodyguard, it was still much better than her walking home alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them left the school and made their way home. While talking about whatever came to mind, they walked through the city at night, heading towards the girl's home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's gotten pretty late, hasn't it? Are you busy right now with your job as the student council president?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not all that much, I guess. My term of office is about to end after all, so I just thought that I'd prepare for everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see. It's already the middle of November, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was actually pretty late for her, thinking about how the other 3rd years are all busy taking college entrance exams or searching for a job.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the next student council president will be Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess. Since the predecessor usually decides on their successor, she's pretty sure to win if no other candidate appears."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes me feel a bit lonely, to be honest."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had worked in the student council president as a temporary member, thinking that Shiho would be gone soon was making him feel a bit sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll still stop by from time to time until I graduate. Leaving it only to Ayano-chan and the others would also be a bit tough, so we'll have to look for new members while we still can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Without Takasaki-senpai, it's just the three of them, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you were to join, though, I could leave the student council in peace. Can't you maaaaybe rethink your decision?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahah, I was joking. Don't worry about it." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She may have said she was joking, but she probably was still troubled by the current situation. Because of the hard work involved, the student council was chronically understaffed. Not to mention that two of the members had just barely joined this year. The hole that Shiho would leave behind would definitely have to be filled by somebody.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I don't have the right to worry about them, after having prioritized the calligraphy club…</p>
<p class="null-p">He could only wish that good, dependable people would follow Shiho. Even though he didn't have the right to think that, he still did.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Oh, Keiki-senpai?" "Hm…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki lifted his head when someone suddenly called him. Looking ahead, he saw a blonde-haired girl standing beneath a streetlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing a comfy-looking sweater and jeans, and she had a vinyl bag in her hand as she walked towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really is Keiki-senpai. And… Kaichou-san?" "Good evening, Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho greeted her with a smile, while Yuika gave a slight bow in return. "Are you on your way home from a shopping tour?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. Yuika just suddenly wanted to eat some pudding from a convenience store… And what about Keiki-senpai? This is quite the weird pairing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Stare</p>
<p class="null-p">For whatever reason, the Kouhai looked at Keiki with a displeased face. Certain doubts seemed to fill her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, listen to this. Keiki-kun was so worried about me that he even wanted to escort me home~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-Takasaki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, is that so… So you were so worried about her that you wanted to escort her home… Hmmmmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, Yuika-chan's gazes is as cold as ice…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her gaze made him feel like she was looking at a pig. Thanks to Shiho's teasing words, Yuika was definitely angry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were the two of you always this close?" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is hoping that she's wrong, but you two aren't going out, are you?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Insanity was radiating from her eyes, and cold sweat started running down the boy's cheek. This flow of events was the same as with Sayuki. Namely, that Yuika would also end up as an enemy who would oppose their plans.</p>
<p class="null-p">To avoid this gloomy future, he made eye contact with Shiho, only to receive a lovable wink from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to worry. Keiki-kun and I don't have that sort of relationship."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard that her slave candidate was still free, Yuika let out a relieved sigh as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but-"</p>
<p class="null-p">With calm movements, Shiho casually wrapped her hand around Keiki's arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm actually interested in Keiki-kun, so I might actually fall for him, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai?! What are you talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho's explosive exclamation left Yuika speechless, while Keiki exclaimed in a panic. Naturally, he had no leisure to actually enjoy the soft feeling that was being pressed against his arm. Yuika puffed out her cheeks with a "Hmph!" while Keiki was busy averting his gaze from the sadistic Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaichou-san, let go of Keiki-senpai already! This is something you should do with a special someone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? This is something that even friends do nowadays, right? Look!" "Ah, again?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring Yuika's order, Shiho pressed her body against Keiki even more. As expected, the virgin boy completely froze up when he felt the intense pressure from her chest. The more their distance closed, the higher Yuika's anger gauge went.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yuika hates you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara ara, she hates me now. I'm sorry for teasing you."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if a token of apology, Shiho let go of Keiki's arm. Although Yuika's wariness was still at its peak, she smiled at Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But think about it." "?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you react like that, this means that Keiki-kun is someone precious to you. Right, Koga-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a result of that surprise attack, Yuika's face went completely red in an instant. In a panic, she looked at Keiki and awkwardly turned her face to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Whatever! Yuika's ice cream is going to melt, so she'll excuse herself now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, didn't you buy pudding?" "See you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring Keiki's comment, Yuika ran away from the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, both Sayuki and Yuika were now targeting them. They might still be doubtful about their relationship, and their future actions might be unknown, but at this point it was written in stone that they would try to obstruct Keiki and Shiho's lovey-dovey flirty operation. And that was all because Shiho kept blurting out unnecessary comments like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you keep on instigating things like this?" Keiki asked. "Because they're cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cute?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Both Tokihara-san and Koga-san really make it obvious that they love Keiki-kun. That makes them look so cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, Keiki-kun really is loved."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I had to describe it, it's more like they're rejecting me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho seemed to have a grave misunderstanding that both Sayuki and Yuika were holding passionate feelings of love towards Keiki. They really only wanted to make Keiki their future master/slave, but since their fetish was very personal to them, he decided to not tell her about it. Thus, he kept quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, Keiki gave up on thinking about that topic, and continued with his duty to escort the girl home. After around ten minutes had passed…</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're here. This is my home." "I'm glad that nothing happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">The house they arrived at was a standalone building in the residential district. "Want to take a quick break first? I'll get you some tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'll hold off on that today. My little sister is waiting at home, after all." "Ahaha, you really are a siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">Stepping into the house of a girl just like that was like a high-level quest for boys. Setting aside the fact that a normie that had tons of experience, for the virgin boy Keiki who had never had a girlfriend in all his life, it felt like stepping into the castle of the demon lord at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that's a shame. I was really expecting something…" "Eh? D-Does that…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was hoping we could play games together…" "Ahh, you were talking about games…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, though, he did promise that he would play games with her sometime. Keiki felt embarrassed for getting such perverted thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's already pretty late, so let's do that another time." "That's a promise, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I promise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Very well. But thanks for escorting me home." "No problem. See you tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them exchanged brief parting words, and Keiki started walking home after watching Shiho step inside. He started walking all alone down the night streets.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, the stalker never appeared, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There had been the unexpected meet-up with Yuika, but there was no suspicious person in sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it'd be great if there was no stalker to begin with."</p>
<p class="null-p">To be fair, Shouma never realized that he was always in the eye of the professional stalker Koharu. It was still to early label it a misunderstanding. To find out if it was, they would have to keep acting as lovers for a little while longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, he enjoyed his lunch once again with Shiho in the courtyard. They kept acting as lovers in hopes that the stalker would see them. Once Keiki returned to the classroom with a full stomach, Mao called out to him with a somewhat angered expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, come with me for a sec."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh, lunch break is about to end, though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just shut up and come with me." "O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she spoke to him more forcely, Keiki stopped resisting and just quietly followed her. The place she took him to was an empty classroom in the depths of the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So what is this about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after they entered, Mao showed him her smartphone. "Ugh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown on the screen was a lovey-dovey couple who didn't hesitate to flirt even in front of other people. The bench they sat on seemed more than familiar, and the fact that Keiki was resting his head on Shiho's lap made it look like one of those celebrity scandal pictures.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not gonna tell me that you have no idea what this is, right?" "Uuummmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course he knew exactly what this was about. The very situation in this photo had occurred around twenty minutes ago. After eating their lunch much like the previous day, Shiho suddenly said the following:</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, I want to try something else today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By that, do you mean the 'Open wide~' thing from yesterday?" "Exactly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what do you have in mind?" "A lap pillow~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lap… pillow?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that sense, Keiki had definitely experienced the lap pillow with that beauty. But he certainly didn't imagine that a picture would be taken at that very moment…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you have a picture of that, Nanjou?" "Master just sent it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it was Koharu-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao quickly fiddled with her smartphone, and it now showed the email from that Koharu. The subject was tilted 'Crazy Scoop!', followed by the main message:</p>
<p class="null-p">In the courtyard, Kiryuu-kun and Kaichou-san have been lovey-dovey for a while now! And I just happened to take a picture of it!</p>
<p class="null-p">The passing Koharu had taken the chance, and created this undeniable proof. "This basically says everything, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What might you be talking about…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That you are going out with the student council president." "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he didn't reply with definite answer, Mao was clearly even more disgruntled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's even more obvious if you fail to answer! You cheater! Why do you run after other girls when you already have Shouto…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why am I being persecuted all of a sudden…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He hadn't done anything bad. But now he felt like a husband who had been caught cheating on his wife.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Serious talk now, Takasaki-senpai and I aren't going out. There are some</p>
<p class="null-p">circumstances, and we're eating lunch together as a result of that." "Kiryuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you satisfied?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of circumstances would explain a lap pillow at school?" "You're absolutely right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If you want a lap pillow that badly, you can just ask me…" "Eh, what did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki asked for confirmation, the girl just quickly averted her gaze. "If you want a lap pillow, then just have Akiyama do it for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really do keep coming up with new ways to torture me."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's a fujoshi for you. She would always come up with things that no normal human being would be able to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway! Even if God allows you to have a relationship, I definitely won't, Kiryuu! …Ah, but getting clingy with boys is a different matter!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you want me to do, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's rough breathing that she had while spitting out the last part made her look like a beast. That reddish brown sidetail might even be her tail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, just rest assured. Takasaki-senpai and I aren't really going out. Also, you'd have trouble with your doujin material if I actually got a girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but…" "Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's not it… Idiot…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're gonna cheat, at least do it with Rinnosuke?!" "You were mad about that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinnosuke was a manga character who had been brought into existence by using Rintarou as a model. Apparently, Shouto was the main love interest, while Rinnosuke was something like the person having an affair. It was the worst possible love triangle.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment however, the chime rang through the school, announcing that there was almost no time left in the current lunch break. Although they hurried back to their class, the two of them still ended up late.</p>
<p class="null-p">At his home, Keiki had finished eating dinner, and was now resting his body in the steaming hot water in the bathtub, looking up at the ceiling as he reminisced about that day's events.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As of right now, the stalker hasn't shown any movement."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki escorted Shiho home today once again, but the stalker still didn't show himself. However, during their make-believe lovers roleplay for the past two days, there was one thing that Keiki had realized. That was the fact that he could definitely feel a gaze when he was with Shiho. Obviously, the student council president would gather some amount of attention just because of position. Since he had received a lap pillow and Koharu had seen that by chance just showed that it was a matter of time before the stalker would move to action. It'd be great if the stalker would decide to give up on her then, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just how long do we have to keep this up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They had no information whatsoever on the stalker, and no certain proof that he actually existed. In this situation where everything was just a big uncertain haze, bringing this to a quick end would certainly be impossible. The only thing that Keiki knew for sure was…</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we continue pretending to be lovers, the perverts will definitely try to get in our way soon…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki, Yuika and Mao had all found out that there was something weird between Keiki and Shiho. If both of them continued to be lovey-dovey in public places, there would be something that would happen, for sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though Mizuha doesn't seem to know about it just yet." "You rang?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When his monologue was interrupted, Keiki looked up. Mizuha standing in front of the door, gazing at Keiki. She wasn't wearing her normal clothes, but instead was wearing a school swimsuit for whatever reason. Without hesitation, she took another step inside the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on, Mizuha-san?! What are you just coming in like that?!" "I thought it'd be nice to take a bath together for old time's sake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you before, but that was way back when we were just little kids!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was another incident with his little sister attacking him during bath time. In response, Keiki sunk his body deeper into the water and took a defensive position out of wariness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just so you know, normal siblings don't take a bath together." "But they aren't us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a kid who can be deceived with something as simple as that… Also, why are you wearing a swimsuit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I was naked, the Nii-san would definitely be embarrassed, so I thought that a school swimsuit should be safe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm naked, though, so this is definitely still not okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then should I just take it off as well so we match?" "Just leave already! No, I'll just go myself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The rather docile looking little sister of his could actually be quite obstinate. Deciding that his best choice was to leave this place himself, Keiki quickly wrapped a bath towel around his lower half before Mizuha called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Nii-san. I actually have a reason for being here today." "And what kind of reason would that be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that I should wash Nii-san's back today." "I wholeheartedly decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go wash your back then, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why am I being ignored?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't let me, then I might just rid myself of my school swimsuit right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it! I get it already, so don't put your hands on your shoulder straps!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He frantically stopped his little sister, whose movements getting more and more dangerous. As of right now, it should be clear as day that his beloved little sister was an exibitionist that was ready to go full birthday suit even in front of her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a time when she came out and confessed her romantic feelings towards Keiki. She had even tried to seduce him several times. Even though she might not be blood related, just giving in like that held its own set of problems. But being unable to adamantly stop her from acting this way clearly showed that Keiki truly was a siscon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, just promise that you won't try anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I promise."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that quick exchange, Keiki sat down on a bath stool. Behind him, Mizuha picked up a sponge and bath soap and quickly started scrubbing her older brother's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, does this feel good?" "Yeah, it feels pretty nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me if you feel itchy anywhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayo~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Nii-san?" "Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it true that you got a lap pillow from Takasaki-senpai?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She-Found-Out?! The time my little sister found out about me receiving a lap pillow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki was unable to turn around because of the fear filling his body, Mizuha was smiling as her face was reflected in the bathroom mirror.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, her eyes weren't.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to be eating lunch together. You even came home later than usual both yesterday and today. That was because you were going home with Takasaki-senpai, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's, well, umm…" "Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She stopped scrubbing him with the sponge and spoke in a calm voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you going out with Takasaki-senpai?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That made it the second time that he had been asked that today. This probably meant that the girls in the calligraphy club were sharing information. That would mean that this wasn't something he could run away from. Apparently, Mizuha took his silence as an affirmation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, there are some complicated circumstances." "Nii-san has a girlfriend…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, umm… are you listening?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's fine. It's still fine. There's no need to panic. I mean, little sister stuff is really popular right now, and I'm not his real little sister either, so we can get married… Yes, the one to win in the end will be me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she just continued to mutter something to herself. Almost like she was being possessed. The older brother just sat there in fear, completely lost as to what to do after this sudden change in his little sister's mood. Mizuha suddenly let out an energetic "Yoi!" and leaned against Keiki's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwahaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was embraced like that, he could feel her boast-worthy chest being pressed against him. In a moment, he could feel the blood rushing to his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san?! What are you doing?!" "A special service?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't that kind of establishment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this definitely feels really good, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without dwelling more on her older brother's response, Mizuha just started moving her chest up and down his back. Almost as if she was trying to wash his back with her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaa…"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">His voice started leaking out, unable to keep quiet from the pleasure. In response, Mizuha let out a faint laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. It feels good, right Nii-san?" "Uuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although there was the fabric of the swimsuit between them, he could feel her chest almost directly on his back. That soft feeling was slowly but steadily burning away Keiki's ability to think straight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If it comes down to it, we just have to create an indisputable action that will make her give up… We're living together, after all, so there will be tons of chances to seduce you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can hear some unpleasant vocabulary in there?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha might look decent at a glance, but she had a rather extreme side hidden within her. This whole situation was proof of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I-I can't… anymore!</p>
<p class="null-p">The continuous attack of her breasts brought Keiki close to his limit. Combining that with the erotic sounds she was making, the small Keiki-kun might end up greeting her any second.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm done now, thanks!" "Ah, Nii-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just take your time, Mizuha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this rate, his ability to think might be completely lost. Hence, in order to protect his virginity, he dashed out of the bathroom and left Mizuha behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, he waited until Mizuha had calmed down, and explained the circumstances to her, which left her satisfied for the time being. Since Mizuha wasn't as egoistic as to let Shiho spend her days in potential danger,</p>
<p class="null-p">she stopped complaining, and Keiki even received Mizuha's permission to act as her bodyguard.</p>
<p class="null-p">When it drew close to 10pm, Keiki was lying on top of his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If this stalker incident doesn't get cleared up soon, my body probably won't be able to hold up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pretending to be lovers with Shiho would get his heart racing, and the attacks of the pervert girls would chip down his HP sometime soon. Keiki might collapse before things came to an end. It really was bad luck that the girls from the calligraphy club had found out so quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt a shiver run down his spine, imagining what kind of torture would await him. Just then, his phone suddenly vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…An email?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wondering who would text him at such an hour, Keiki got up and grabbed his smartphone. When he checked his new messages-</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? This address…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown there was a message from an unknown address. If it was someone from his contacts, their address should be shown there. However, that wasn't the case. There wasn't even a subject, so maybe it was some sort of scam? As soon as Keiki opened it, however, a single picture was displayed on the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like it was a bit after gym class. The location was a water tap, with Shiho taking a drink. Her bra was faintly visible through the sweat-drenched white shirt that she was wearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a simple text message. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">That very line made Keiki stiffen up in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Break up with Takasaki Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was short and concise. A threatening message meant to force the fake couple to break up.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: One of them is the perpetrator!</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the middle of November, on a slightly freezing autumn morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki, who had arrived at school earlier than usual, stepped inside the empty classroom. He stood at the window and watched the baseball club's morning practice as he waited for a certain individual. Said person soon joined him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Keiki-kun." "Good morning, Takasaki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what is it? You called me here, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I have something important to talk to Senpai about." "Eh? Does that mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho seemed to have imagined something, and her cheeks started to turn a faint red. As if she were expecting something, she looked up at her Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you seriously fell in love with me while we were pretending to be lovers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it." "What a shame~"</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, she pouted slightly at being let down like that, but she soon realized that Keiki wasn't up for any jokes, and spoke again in a more serious tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A photo of Takasaki-senpai was sent to my smartphone yesterday." "A photo of me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took his smartphone out of his pocket and showed Shiho the very email he had received the day prior. With the request… no, the single-sentence demand for him to break up with Takasaki Shiho, and the picture with the barely-visible bra. Shiho read the message and looked at Keiki again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-kun, you pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just so we're clear, I didn't take this picture." "Then delete it. Right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't delete important evidence like this. Don't worry, as soon as this is over, I'll definitely delete it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? You don't think that it's a waste to delete it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I think that it's a waste from the bottom of my heart." "So you actually do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was upfront with Shiho, Keiki received a rather cold glare in return. However, that was nothing compared to Yuika's glare that could kill people. On the contrary, it made her actually look rather cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this proves that there actually is a stalker. Though I didn't expect them to take voyeuristic photos like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I had no idea…" Shiho muttered as her expression grew grim.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without her consent, or even her knowledge, photos of her had been taken. Anybody would feel a certain degree of fear, since they were unable to do</p>
<p class="null-p">anything against it. Not to mention that the one sentence at the end of it displayed a certain level of anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">It really wasn't just Senpai's imagination…</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh how glad he would've been if it was. But now that a photo like this were in the game, this couldn't be played off as a mere joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did us pretending to be lovers have the opposite effect?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since they're asking us to break up, it certainly doesn't seem like they'll give up anytime soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">The plan was to make the stalker give up by showing him that she already had a boyfriend, but that seemed to anger the other party even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So as to not enrage them any more, let's hold back on the flirting for now. But we certainly can't ignore them either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know… Since they sent it to you, that means…" "Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The email was sent directly to Keiki's phone. That meant that the perpetrator</p>
<p class="null-p">knew Keiki's email address.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a good chance that the stalker is someone that I know." That was the natural conclusion they arrived at.</p>
<p class="null-p">But who in the world…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Firstly, they could probably exclude Shouma and Koharu, because they had no apparent reason to obstruct their relationship. The most likely suspects were actually the girls from the calligraphy club. After all, they had the greatest motivation to break up the current relationship between Keiki and Shiho. They might have seen them flirting and gotten the wrong idea about it, hence sending that email to Keiki from a fake address, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't think that the girls from the calligraphy club would just send me an anonymous message like that…</p>
<p class="null-p">They wouldn't beat around the bush like that. No, they would confront Keiki to his face. Also, this gaze that Shiho had felt was there even before they started acting as lovers. That meant that the order of events didn't fit. There also shouldn't be any reason for the girls to target Shiho to begin with.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hence, Keiki decided that it couldn't be someone from the calligraphy club. "That means…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, do you have any ideas?" "Ah, no…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, Keiki had come up with a theory, but that would definitely end up hurting Shiho. After all…</p>
<p class="null-p">It can't be one of the student council members… Right?</p>
<p class="null-p">During the time he was a temporary member, he had exchanged his contact information with the rest of the student council members.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto Ayano, the student council vice president.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase Airi, the treasurer, who values morals over anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mitani Rin, the secretary, who has a hobby of wearing female clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">They definitely had ties to Takasaki Shiho, and since they all knew Keiki's email address, they were definitely candidates for being the stalker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'll try to find the perpetrator as fast as I can." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please call me immediately if anything happens. I'll definitely protect you, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he showed Shiho a confident smile, her gloomy expression cleared up a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. I'll be counting on you, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the two of them stepped out of the classroom. "Now then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started thinking as walked down the hallway, making his way towards his classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">If the stalker is one of the student council members, then who was the most likely suspect?</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi loved yuri, so she would have a motive in a lot of ways.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wouldn't be weird to think that Ayano's smell fetish would also trigger with people of the same sex.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Rin might look like a beautiful girl, but he could be an assertive boy who had a thing for big breasts. There was a possibility that he had developed romantic feelings for Shiho during their work in the student council, and had ended up as a stalker because of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">-In short, they all had possible motives.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, I should check them out one by one."</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The same day, during lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing his lunch in the classroom, Keiki walked past the student entrance, and there he was greeted by an unexpected sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase Airi was crouching down on the floor, looking under a vending</p>
<p class="null-p">machine, looking like a dog that was stretching as she tried to grab something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san? What are you doing?" "Eh? …Ahh, Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lifting up her head to look at her Senpai, Airi spoke in a troubled manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was going to buy something to drink, but I accidentally dropped my money."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a catastrophe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the coins that she wanted to use to buy a drink had fallen under the vending machine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's how it is, so don't bother me right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kouhai cut the conversation short and returned to her work. She was trying her best to reach for a coin, but her arms were just barely not long enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, should I get it for you?" "It's fine. I'll get it myself." "But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't need your help. You probably have some ulterior motive, like you want me to be in your debt or something, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not it…" "?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you're in that position, I can see your panties…" "Nya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a shriek that resembled a startled cat, Airi jumped up. With a face as red as a tomato, she held both her hands to her butt, presumably trying to hide it, as she glared at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Did you see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, I didn't see anything. Just barely, though." "I wonder about that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really didn't. I did see your thighs, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sexual harassment! That's clearly sexual harassment! This is why men are…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The high school girl started venting her anger, and her breathing grew rougher. Keiki had clearly made the right choice, since he had been able to see something blue just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, should I get the money for you?" "Uuu… Please do…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At your service."</p>
<p class="null-p">After switching positions with Airi, Keiki was now crouching on the floor, and he could see the money that Airi had presumably dropped. It was really far in the back, but still close enough for his arms to reach it, making this mission a success.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Thank you very much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he handed her the 500 yen coin, Airi bowed down to Keiki ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, please wait a second."</p>
<p class="null-p">As she said this, she put the coin she had just gotten into the vending machine. She pressed the button twice, and two packs of cafe au lait rolled down. Airi handed one to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't have to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't like having open debts." "Then I'll gladly accept it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Giving his thanks, Keiki accepted the drink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you come here to buy something as well, Kiryuu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was looking for you, to be honest. I sent you an email as well, earlier. There's something I wanted to talk about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm sorry. I had my phone in my bag, so I didn't notice." "That can happen sometimes, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we find a place to sit down instead of standing here?" "That sounds good to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd be better to have a calm place to sit down while talking. As Airi started walking, Keiki followed after her, and pondered to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase-san does seem fishy. She likes yuri, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">She herself accepts the fact that she hates men, and she values morals more than anything, but she still writes rather perverted love stories about two girls. Just recently, she had been excited about pairing up Yuika X Sayuki, and had been fantasizing about them day and night. She seemed to respect Shiho as well, and that respect could very well turn into love, which would put her on the path to becoming a stalker.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place they moved to was the same classroom they had used before during their attempts to cure Airi's hate for men. Nobody ever came here, so it was the perfect place for private conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">After sitting down on the chairs that were nearby, they both put straws in their drinks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what business do you have with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, well… I was just wondering how things were going on your end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you making this sound like we're friends who have finally seen each other after a long time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi narrowed her eyebrows in response Keiki's nonchalant question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, pretty normal I guess. I've managed to not anger any boys that I came in contact with, as well. And my relationship with Yuika is progressing smoothly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but Yuika got really mad at me a while ago. I couldn't contain my desires, and I touched her breasts while we were changing for gym class."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course that'd make her angry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But an angry Yuika is cute in itself, so it was worth it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"One day, I want to ask her if she wants to sleep over at my place. Then I want to take a bath together with her. I'm glad that I was born a woman. Being able to legally take a bath together with such a beauty would be paradise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yikes."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was clear that Airi treasured Yuika, even though it felt like she was going a bit too far. So much so that Keiki would readily accept it if this whole thing wasn't because of her yuri tendencies. Alas, it had nothing to do with actual romantic feelings. Maybe Airi was indeed a stalker, but her target was probably Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what about you, Kiryuu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to be getting pretty close with Shiho-senpai." "Ummm… How do you know about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's become quite the rumour. About Shiho-senpai giving you a lap pillow in the courtyard and so on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I guess that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an understandable result of their actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They even say that the harem king has finally started aiming for the student council president."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Harem king…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is probably the reason why Yuika seems to have been in a bad mood since yesterday. Though she said something like 'It seems that Keiki-senpai needs some more punishment' with a bright smile."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll just act like I didn't hear that." A queen's retaliation is a scary thing. "Aren't you angry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Angry about what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That I'm being so close with Takasaki-senpai. I thought that the man-hating Nagase-san might not like the idea of that or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh… Well it's true that I can't really trust boys, but…" "But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do trust you quite a bit." "Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki's gaze turned into a surprised stare, the girl got flustered and averted her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, I don't think that Kiryuu-senpai would be a worthy man for Shiho-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm guessing that Shiho-senpai asked you to act like this because she had some bothersome circumstances, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you an esper or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's as plain as day. But… I was a bit frustrated that she didn't come ask me for help…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With her true feelings spilled, Airi made a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's very rare for Shiho-senpai to ask for help, you know? So please do whatever you can to save her. Okay, Kiryuu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, leave it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what he was planning on doing from the very start. To free her from the stalker who was plaguing her, and to take her worries away. He had no plans whatsoever to desert that job this late in the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, also. If you're really not going out with Shiho-senpai, you're better off</p>
<p class="null-p">explaining that to Ayano-senpai." "Why Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, she's been very absent-minded, and she seems very depressed and deprived of any energy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… It's fine if you don't understand." "What's this about…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had no clue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was Ayano not feeling well? Why would Airi tell him about that right then? But there's one thing that he knew for certain. And that was that Nagase Airi seemed completely unrelated to the stalker case.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes ended, the time was nearing 4pm in the afternoon. After losing a match of rock-paper-scissors to decide whose turn it was to clean the classroom, Keiki ended as the designated janitor. He was currently carrying the trash bag out to the garbage collection point on the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the looks of it, Nagase-san isn't the perpetrator…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At first he had thought that she would be the most likely candidate, but after having a talk with her, the girl wasn't suspicious at all whatsoever. Naturally, he didn't have any proof of her innocence, but he certainly didn't believe that she had lied, seeing how much she respected Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's not her, then the next suspicious person is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While muttering to himself, he was walking down the first floor hallway when suddenly-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, he could hear someone's voice, which stopped him in his tracks. When he scanned his surroundings for the source, he couldn't find anybody.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was it just my imagination?" "-O-Outside the window." "Outside the window?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was told that little hint, Keiki stuck his head out the window. When he did, his eyes met up with Fujimoto Ayano, who was shaking fiercely as she was clinging to a branch on top of a tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?! What are you doing?!" "It's a long story…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was a cat on top of this tree, and she wouldn't come down." "Ohh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I thought that I would help her out, but now I can't get down, myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You became the very thing you set out to save?! Also, that story isn't all that long!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that the cat just jumped down herself…" "How unlucky is that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably tried her best to climb up there, only to get left behind by the cat…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please… Don't abandon me…?" "I won't, so don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Only the devil would be emotionally able to ignore a crying girl like her. "Anyway, I'm coming over right now, so don't move."</p>
<p class="null-p">After setting the trash bag down at the collection point, he stepped outside the window into the courtyard. He knew that it was bad manners to do that, but it was an emergency, so he had no choice. Thanks to that shortcut, he could be there for the girl a few seconds faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I didn't think I'd need you help me like this, Kiryuu-kun." "No, it's not like you did anything wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">Going this far to save a cat in trouble was very much like Ayano. But the bigger problem right now was thinking about how to get her down from the tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… You're pretty high up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A while ago, he had also climbed a tree to save a cat, but he had never expected to be forced to save a girl who was stuck in a tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I certainly can't put you in my clothes like the cat back then… So I guess all I can do is get a ladder…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… Thank you…" "I'll be right back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you can take your time." "But I mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I don't hurry, your skirt will get flipped up soon…" "Fueh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With Keiki pointing that out, Ayano quickly put both her hands on her butt. "Ah, idiot! If you let go that quickly…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that her hands weren't holding the branch anymore, she lost her balance. Naturally, since she wasn't some trapeze artist from a circus, she was unable to regain her grip, and her legs lost their footing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaa?!" "Fujimoto-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started dashing to catch her. Shortly afterwards, he heard a dull sound, and both of them collapsed to the ground. Thanks to Keiki's quick thinking, Ayano had safely made it to the ground… but on top of the boy. He had collapsed with his face upwards, and her butt was pressing into his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmhmmmhm?! Mmmmhmhmm?! (Eh?! What's this, what's happening?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyan?! K-Kiryuu-kun?! Your breath is hitting me…?!" Fujimoto-san screamed aloud as Keiki's breath hit her through the panties, which sent shivers through her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">In his situation however, Keiki couldn't really understand her, and he just frantically tried to breathe in order to survive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmmmm?! Hmhmhmhmh?!" "Hyaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano jumped up with a red face, letting out a cute shriek. Finally free, Keiki took deep breaths as if his life depended on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… Haaah… I thought I was going to die…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having made it through that situation, which was dangerous in a lot of ways,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki slowly got up, appreciating the fresh air that was filling his lungs. Ayano threw an angry glare at him as she pushed down her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun… Pervert." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, the poor Kiryuu-kun was unable to understand the meaning behind her words. Shortly afterwards, though, Keiki connected the dots behind her expression and her gestures, and all the blood rushed to his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that just now was an accident! But still, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Accident or not, he basically had stuffed his face into the skirt of a girl. Hence, he furiously apologized, and bowed down at a full 90 degrees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But it's fine! For some reason, it smelled like flowers! It was a really good smell, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Smell?!" "Ah, oops…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had intended to follow up with an apology, but he had dug his own grave instead. Bringing up smell in this situation made him sound more like a pervert than a saviour, and because it was Ayano of all people, her face became even redder than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Oh right, are you okay, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, I'm fine thanks to you. Thank you for saying me…" "Y-Yeah… You're welcome…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Ayano had thanked Keiki, she still wouldn't look him in the eyes. W-Well, that aside, this might be the perfect chance to cross-examine her… Fujimoto Ayano was one of the potential suspects for being the stalker. He</p>
<p class="null-p">had planned to search for her after throwing away the trash, anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">The student council vice president who loves sniffing boys' sweaty odor. He thought that she might also be interested in the smell of girls, so there was a chance that she was aiming for Shiho's panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a test, he imagined what that very scene would look like.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano would be sitting on the couch in the student council office, sniffing some cute panties as she said to herself "Rather than Kiryuu-kun's underwear, Kaichou's panties smell so much better… Haah… haah…"-</p>
<p class="null-p">That seemed way worse than sniffing some guy's underwear, right? "Uhm, Fujimoto-san, there's something I'd like to ask of you. Can I?" "Me? Not Kaichou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Why did you suddenly bring up Takasaki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to be really close to Kaichou recently. You never bothered to come see me or anything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that jealous reply?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Averting her gaze, Ayano puffed out her cheeks in a pout. It made her look like a maiden in love. Maybe this was what Airi was talking about? She was jealous because of the rumours going around about Keiki and Shiho, and was acting weird because of it?</p>
<p class="null-p">"It truly is vexing. Even though Ayano-san loves Kiryuu-kun's smell more than anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it really was about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the jealousy part was correct, the rest of it was still perverted like usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did you want to ask me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't get mad at me…" "Eh? Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You like boys' freshly-worn underwear, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed, though it's more like I can barely hold myself back if they're within reach."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… very interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, that was exactly what Keiki anticipated. Now was the real question. "Then are you interested in freshly-worn panties from girls, Fujimoto-san?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, all light disappeared from Ayano's eyes. "Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Girls' panties don't get me excited in the slightest. Not one bit." "Ah, okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though her face was expressionless, you could feel the earnestness behind her words. As things stood, it seemed that Ayano hadn't awakened to the excitement of a girl's smell.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess that means that Fujimoto-san isn't the stalker either…?</p>
<p class="null-p">That meant that the fantasies that Keiki had imagined were nothing more than a mistake on his part. With this, Keiki learned that Fujimoto-san had no reason whatsoever to stalk Shiho. Hence, the only candidate left was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me get this straight. How do you feel about Takasaki-senpai, Rintarou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… That's an abrupt question if I've ever heard one…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's investigation of Ayano had ended, and he finished his job disposing trash. Right now, Keiki was pulling a kabe-don on his kouhai, Mitani Rin, behind the school with no people around. With his Senpai boxing him in like that, the boy who was actually wearing boy clothes for once flashed a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you called me out here, I totally thought you were going to confess to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please stop talking about that. That would never happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how cute he might look, Rin was a boy. Keiki detested the doujins that Mao created, and he had no interest in boys. There was a boy who had confessed to Rin before at the culture festival, but that was because he was under the impression that Rin was actually a girl, which resulted in a broken heart and a shock of a lifetime.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Then can we at least stop the kabe-don?" "Not until you confess everything." "Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After questioning Airi and Ayano, he found nothing suspicious about them. Since neither of them could be the perpetrator, that only left Rintarou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he might wear clothes that a girl would, both his body and heart were that of a man. After starting to work in the student council, he had started developing feelings for his upperclassman Shiho, and after being unable to suppress those feelings, and not knowing how to deal with them, he ended up as a stalker. That was what Keiki suspected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how do you feel about Takasaki-senpai now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm, let's see… Shii-chan-senpai sure is a charming woman. She's good at her job, kind towards everyone, and that clumsy part that she shows from time to time really make her a lovable individual."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're unexpectedly straightforward, aren't you, Rintarou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She even allowed me to work while wearing a girl's uniform. I was really happy about that. She accepted me, even though I was different…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, to be honest, I prefer girls with bigger breasts than her." "You really are the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was a cute-looking shit-faced bastard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh, Kei-kun-senpai likes big breasts as well, right?" "That I do, but I don't choose girls based on that alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, he couldn't fall in love with a girl just because her breasts were</p>
<p class="null-p">big. But, before Keiki could question Rin any further- "Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl's shriek rang out close to them. "Uwah?! W-What was that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked over towards the source, there was a reddish brown-haired girl with a sidetail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keeki is doing a kabe-don on Rinnosukeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?!" "Hey, stop right there! Don't take pictures!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Flashing a devilish grin with her smartphone in hand, the fujoshi started furiously tapping the photo button on her camera. At lightning speed, Keeki freed Rinnosuke from the kabe-don.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, the investigation of the final stalker candidate ended as well. Apparently, Shiho's chest size wasn't enough to satisfy the hidden beast inside Rin. Nevermind concrete evidence, it had enough persuasiveness in itself to make Keiki believe him.</p>
<p class="null-p">So Rintarou isn't the stalker either?</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he was enough of a scummy guy to prioritize girls according to their chest size, he wasn't the type of human who would trouble girls like that. Of course, this didn't mean that all his doubts were cleared up or anything, but there was no counter-evidence that proved that Rintarou was the stalker.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, after all that questioning, Keiki still couldn't figure out the identity of the stalker. He couldn't even find any worthwhile information that would lead Keiki to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">After waiting for her job at the student council to end, Keiki escorted Shiho</p>
<p class="null-p">home.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said mysterious things like "Sorry for always making you do this~" and "You promised to never tell anyone, okay~" while Keiki matched his walking speed with hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, even during that time, all he thought about was the stalker who was targeting Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just who is the person who has their eyes set on Shiho…?</p>
<p class="null-p">That other person even knows Keiki's email address. When he realized that, he theorized that the stalker had a high chance of being one of the student council members, but none of the three showed any signs of being fishy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was as obsessed with Yuika as ever. Ayano only was interested in men's underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou could only see breasts and nothing more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, there could be lies hidden in their testimonies, but Keiki didn't think that one of them was the kind of person who would terrorize the student council president Shiho whom they looked up to so much. Hence, the search for the stalker was back to square one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, is the stalker really someone that I know? If not, how would they have gotten their hands on my email address…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it a super hacker who snuck into the phone company's network and found his number with that? That at least sounded way too irrational to be true, but the stalker had indeed gotten his email address somehow. In the end, the chances were high that it was someone that Keiki knew, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's how far Keiki thought until he realized that his thoughts had taken a complete 360 and wound up at the start again. As he unconsciously let out a sigh, Shiho peered into his face while walking next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, you seem to be a bit tired."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a day full of ups and downs, after all. He had gone through all sorts of trouble today, and hadn't gained anything from it, which had dealt a lot of damage to his psyche.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we go on a date on the weekend, for a change of pace?" "A date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, you're working really hard for me, aren't you? As thanks, I want to act like a girlfriend for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, that's the contract we made."</p>
<p class="null-p">In return for having Keiki act as her boyfriend during the stalker case, she would act like a girlfriend for him. That was the contract they had made for the time being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that running wild for a bit is a good idea to relax, don't you think?" "But going out together at a time like this is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you won't come with me, then I just have to go out alone." "That I can't allow. It's way too dangerous."</p>
<p class="null-p">They still don't know anything about the stalker. In such a situation, he couldn't let the girl go out on her own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then it's decided! I'm looking forward to it!" "For crying out loud…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he was quite fed up with her after that, seeing the energetic and</p>
<p class="null-p">gleeful smile of the girl made him smile as well, whether he wanted to or not. And that was perfectly fine, because everyone around her would worry about her if she had a gloomy expression instead. Keiki for his part thought that this was indeed a wonderful thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The promised day arrived, and Keiki and Shiho's "date" was in full swing. "The movie was really fun, wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. The foreshadowing was great and you still had no clue about it until everything was revealed."</p>
<p class="null-p">The time of day was around 11am in the morning. Having stepped out of the cinema, the two of them were talking about the western movie they had just watched. Today, the girl was wearing a red skirt with a spacious shirt, and jacket on top of that, which made her look very stylish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Takasaki-senpai is really good-looking…</p>
<p class="null-p">Just while he was sitting next to her during the movie, Keiki felt his heart beating faster. Her long, wavy hair smelled so great that Keiki couldn't believe his senses, and if their gazes met during the movie, her grin was so lovable that it wouldn't be a surprise if he fell in love with her right on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit too early for lunch, so how about we walk around and look at the stores?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds nice. Is there something that you'd like to see, Senpai?" "Let's see… I think I might want to start looking for some winter clothing." "Winter clothing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me just ask this. You're not going to drag me to some lingerie shop,</p>
<p class="null-p">right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why would I do that?" "I was just wondering…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't tell her that he had experienced that before. And even more so the fact that it was to pick out new underwear with his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if it were my lover, it'd be embarrassed to go to a lingerie shop with a boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Figures!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki agreed completely with the girl whose cheeks were colored a faint red. This was a normal reaction from a normal girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stuffing their freshly worn panties into his mouth, showing off their underwear to him, having their older brother pick out underwear, and so on is only something that the perverts of the calligraphy club would do. How wonderful it was to be with a normal girl like Shiho. And seeing her get red when he brought up the topic of underwear was actually pretty cute. For Keiki, who was constantly surrounded by perverts, the girl almost seemed like an angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but do normal couples nowadays actually do that? Maybe I should have Keiki-kun pick out some underwear for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We don't have to act like normal couples."</p>
<p class="null-p">Making nonchalant conversation like this, they began with their window shopping. Naturally, they completely disregarded the lingerie store, and instead went looking for normal western clothes, debating about which clothes would look good on each other, and having each other wear cat ears at a miscellaneous shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">For lunch, they picked a classic fast food restaurant with some hamburgers. When the girl wiped away some sauce stains on his cheek, it really felt like they were a normal couple of lovers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching a movie, going shopping, and having conversations about whatever came to mind-</p>
<p class="null-p">Who would've thought that a normal date could be something so wonderful!</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't be happier. He was experiencing a normal date like this with a normal girl. And when the time was around 3pm, it happened while they were taking a break in a food court in the inside of a mall to drink something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?" "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… I just felt like someone was watching us…" "Is that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not sure yet, but the stalker might be near." "No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way to prove it. But Keiki also felt an uncomfortable feeling just now. When he glanced around the food court, he spotted various people, but nobody looked suspicious at first glance. However, he couldn't deny the possibility that the stalker was hiding in the shadows and spying on them.</p>
<p class="null-p">That would mean that Shiho was not only being targeted at school, but also on her days off. It would be another thing if it was something like a silent guardian similar to Koharu, but the other person was someone who takes voyeuristic pictures like the one Keiki had received. There was no telling what other sorts of things they might resort to if things didn't go their way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, it seemed that just staying passive like this wouldn't solve anything. They had to reveal the stalker's identity, and have him completely stop, or Shiho would be forced to live the rest of her student life in constant fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, they might as well try and go on the aggressive here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If your stalker really is here, then we might be able to try to reveal the person here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But how?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're going to be even more lovey-dovey than at school. With a bit of luck, they'll get enraged and confront us head-on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's your plan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhmmm… Going into a lingerie shop together?" "So you didn't actually think of anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you have any ideas, Takasaki-senpai?" "Let me think…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl put one finger on her lips as she thought. "How about the pocky game?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The pocky… game?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's clarify this. In the pocky game, both participants take an edible stick in their mouths and slowly start eating away at it. It was a very popular party game, where the first one to let go with their mouth loses. Normally, the first contender to feel more embarrassed would be the one to let go, but of neither parties did, it would end with a kiss, making it a normie game for normies during normie activities.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Couples nowadays all do things like that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like to hear about the image that you have in your mind about couples." "But it might work to lure out the stalker, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have any pocky sticks on me, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I thought that something like this might happen, so I brought some with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what were you anticipating would happen today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But now that she had them, Keiki didn't have any reason to decline. After she took the pack out of her bag, Shiho grinned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are we doing this?" "Of course we are."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus it was decided. Quickly finishing their preparations (basically each of them putting one end in their math), they sat across the table and looked at each other with a serious gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you ready?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I have the determination to even kiss Senpai." "You can't do that, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naturally."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then here we go."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking the holding end (with no chocolate on it) in her mouth, Shiho brought her face closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this? She's crazy cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had never known that just holding a pocky stick in their mouths would make a girl look so cute. Telling Keiki that it was his turn with a gaze, he mentally prepared himself and put the other end in his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Obviously, it was very embarrassing. There's no way that anyone could keep a calm mind in such a situation. It was Keiki's first time that a girl had looked at him this closely, and he could feel his reason slowly starting to melt away, just like the chocolate in his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mmm… Mm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki couldn't help but freeze up, Shiho slowly but steadily continued to eat away at the pocky stick.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, right. This is that kind of game.</p>
<p class="null-p">It doesn't end with just looking at each other. It's a test to see who chickens out first.</p>
<p class="null-p">And if I don't do this seriously, the stalker might become suspicious…</p>
<p class="null-p">They had to look like they were actually flirting with each other. Steeling his resolve, Keiki also joined Shiho in nibbling away at the stick.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither of them spoke a word, and they just continued to eat away. It might be a rather plain game, but it definitely got your heart beating similar to a sport an athlete would perform. Shiho for her part seemed embarrassed as well, and her beautiful face started to turn a strong red. Slowly, but steadily, their distance was growing closer and closer…</p>
<p class="null-p">Umm… How long are we going to keep this up?</p>
<p class="null-p">They had never decided on a time to stop. As if she had seen through her Kouhai's mask, and read his mind, Shiho only smiled. She continued munching away on her end of the stick.</p>
<p class="null-p">Closer closer closer?!</p>
<p class="null-p">There was barely any stick left. Their faces were close enough for them to</p>
<p class="null-p">feel each other's breath, and they'd really end up kissing each other if they kept going. Keiki gulped, and just when Shiho was about to cross the final line-</p>
<p class="null-p">"You caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan't!!!" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, being startled by two loud voices overlapping, Shiho and Keiki reflexively separated from each other. Still holding the last bits of the pocky stick in his mouth, Keiki turned his gaze towards the two girls that were the sources of the voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?! Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was wearing a hoodie with jeans and a cap, which gave her a boyish look.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other hand, Sayuki looked more like an office lady. Her hair was in a ponytail and glasses were decorating her beautiful face.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, the fake couple and disguised girls were sitting at the same table. From Keiki, clockwise sat Shiho, Sayuki, and Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how long have you two been tailing us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since around ten minutes before you arrived at the meet-up." "So from the very start, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In short, they had been given absolutely no privacy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We wore disguises to make sure that Keiki-senpai didn't spot us, you know? Since Yuika's hair would stand out, she decided to wear this cap."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yuika had said, her blonde hair really stood out. Trying to hide her hair was the right decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">Weren't the two of them sitting close to us before?</p>
<p class="null-p">They looked so different that Keiki hadn't noticed them at all. So the gaze he had felt earlier was because of the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are those glasses part of your disguise as well, Sayuki-senpai?" "That's correct."</p>
<p class="null-p">Puffing out her chest in a boasting manner, Sayuki pushed up her glasses. "How is it? I look like a beautiful knowledgeable woman, right?" "Rather, that very statement makes you sound like an idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether she was wearing a disguise or not, she still was the same Sayuki. But disregarding that for now, Keiki was more interested in their intentions for following Keiki and Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did you even know that we were going out today? Since you were there from the very start, you must've known from the very beginning, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We received the information from a trustworthy source." "A trustworthy source?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki questioned them, Shiho jumped into the conversation. "Ah, that might be my fault. I mentioned this date to Airi-chan." "Oh, that explains it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika and Airi were good friends. Airi had probably mentioned it to her in passing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't matter right now. The problem at hand is why you two were playing such an indecent game in public like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! A pocky game is definitely not something high school students should be doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's really rich coming from you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, they were two perverts who had done far worse and more perverted things.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems that Takasaki-san has some circumstances behind this whole situation, but if these inexcusable actions with my Keiki-kun continue, I might just take him home myself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika had her eyes on Keiki-senpai long before you! She won't hand him over to Kaichou-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, Keiki-kun is really popular." "No, it really isn't what you think it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">The difference in temperature between the aggravated Sayuki and Yuika, and the calm and collected Shiho was amazing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I myself want to go on a date with Keiki-kun. With the club budget incident and culture festival, I've been severely lacking my Keiki-kun nutrient daily supplements."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Witch-senpai, that's unfair! Yuika also wants to go on a date with Keiki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now they're fighting amongst each other…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To be fair, Sayuki and Yuika were like a dog and a cat. They had been fighting over Keiki for a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about we do a contest, with the right to go on a date with Keiki- kun on the line?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A contest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three calligraphy club members all showed the same reaction in response to Shiho's proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone here wants to go on a date with Keiki-kun, right? Having the person himself choose would leave two disgruntled people, so we'll have a contest. The winner gets to go on a date with him, fair and square."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, that sounds good to me." "No complaints here."</p>
<p class="null-p">The perverted girls showed no signs of disagreeing. Keeping the two of them in the corner of his gaze, Keiki spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But what kind of contest?" "Hm? Isn't the pocky game fine?" "Again with the pocky game…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, there wasn't much to do other than that in a place like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First it's Tokihara-san against Koga-san, and the winner will go against me. The last girl standing receives the right to go on a date with Keiki-kun. All good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I couldn't ask for anything better." "Yuika will win the right for the date."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the curtains for the girls' pocky game tournament were lifted. "I won't hold back just because you're my Kouhai at the club, okay?" "Don't worry, I'll show you how strong I can be."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then please start the first round."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho gave the starting signal, and the girls started eating away at the pocky stick. Sayuki was on the holding end, while Yuika had the chocolate one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sight of them taking this so seriously was almost surreal. "This is pretty boring, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They can't exactly talk, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">But the more the game progressed, the more the atmosphere changed. The pocky stick was starting to get shorter and shorter, and both of them had started to grow wary of the possibility of kissing each other, as their serious expressions slowly started to crumble into ones of agony and embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both of you are turning really red." "Right, right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching this scene unfold wasn't too bad, now that Keiki thought about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nagase-san saw this, she'd probably be getting a nosebleed by now… And Takasaki-senpai? What are you taking out your smartphone for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A commemoration picture. I'd like to save this sight for future generations." "Are you a demon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them already looked like they were dying from embarrassment. What would happen if they saw this?</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was watching the scene unfold, his smartphone vibrated in his pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Who could it be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He took it out, and when he checked the message- "This is…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was another email from the stalker. It was a short message similar to the other one. The text read 'I can see you.'</p>
<p class="null-p">From where?! Where are they?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Making sure that the others didn't notice, Keiki scanned his surroundings. The guests sitting close to them in the food corner, the employees standing by at the counter. Nobody was looking over at them, but any of them could be suspicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, that's the end! The first round goes to Tokihara-san." "Phew, it was no big deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… When Yuika thought about kissing Witch-senpai, she reflexively pulled her head away…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, did you see my overwhelming victory?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm sorry. I wasn't watching at all." "How cruel?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">So why do you have a faint glimmer of happiness in your expression?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided to ignore the masochistic girl who would feel excitement after being treated cruelly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Takasaki-san, it's time for your duel with me!" "Ah, before that, I'll be going to the toilet really quick." "Eh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stared blankly at Shiho as she stood up from her seat. The girl herself didn't understand Keiki's intentions behind that gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">This isn't good! The stalker is right here…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting the girl go away alone right now would be far too dangerous. However, telling her 'Don't go to the bathroom!' would also be a bit much…</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Takasaki-senpai!" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki jumped up and forcefully embraced Shiho from behind. Though there might've been other ways of going at it, Keiki was so focused on stopping her that he couldn't think straight-</p>
<p class="null-p">And to finish it off, Keiki made the worst possible confession. "Please let me come with you to the toilet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, the whole food court fell to absolute silence. Obviously, there was no hidden meaning behind Keiki's words. He had only used the</p>
<p class="null-p">wrong words at the wrong time, even though he just was too worried to let her go alone because of the stalker.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, since nobody knew his intentions, everyone came to the same conclusion when they heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, why are you suddenly hugging a girl like that and asking to accompany her to the toilet?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asking to go to the same toilet as a girl is the worst!" "Eh… H-Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Keiki finally realized his mistake after both of them made it painfully clear, it was already too late. Right now, they were looking at Keiki like he was a complete pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you never asked me for something like that…" "So she's more important than us, Keiki-senpai…?" "Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…" "Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them started to get teary, and they glared at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You idioooooot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They screamed 'idiot' at the top of their lungs as they ran away. And when he turned around to look at Shiho again, she said the following in an apologetic tone of voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy, but going to the toilet together is a bit much…" "It's a misunderstanding!"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The time was close to 7pm. The date had ended, and they returned to their own city again, walking through the night streets next to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha. I didn't expect Keiki-kun to have such a passionate side to him." "I already explained everything, didn't I?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, I know. It was because the stalker was there, so you didn't want to leave me alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While they walked towards Shiho's house, the conversation naturally drifted back to the event at the food court.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being hugged from behind like that really made my heart skip a beat, though. This is the first time a boy did something like that for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, I just thought that letting you go there alone would end badly." "Well, you got that email after all. It can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if the stalker was really present at that moment?" "Probably? But it might also have just been a bluff." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, there was no more interaction with the stalker after that email. Since Sayuki and Yuika hadn't returned either, they just continued with their date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still Tokihara-san and Koga-san really like you, Keiki-kun. You wouldn't really disguise yourself and follow someone on a date if you didn't hold any sort of romantic feelings for them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Romantic feelings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It really wasn't as cute as Shiho thought. Their actions were driven by perversion rather than love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They wanted to go on a date with you so badly that they did that pocky game, you know? You could even go out with both of them if you confessed now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that would be a bit weird…"</p>
<p class="null-p">What would await him after said confessions would be a master and slave two-timing relationship. Naturally, Keiki wasn't really about that sort of life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Then is it fine if I take you?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho suddenly stopped in her tracks and wrapped her arms around Keiki's. "T-Takasaki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eheheh, surprised? It's payback for earlier." "P-Payback…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki-kun? Should we really go out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you turned red." "Don't tease me like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not, though. If it's with Keiki-kun, I feel like I could enjoy the rest of my student life together with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The date today was also really fun. Once this whole matter is settled, we</p>
<p class="null-p">might as well give up on pretending, and start going out for real." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't quite catch up because of the sudden development. However, he understood that that Shiho wasn't joking for once. To say it outright, Keiki wondered if his popular phase had suddenly arrived. Naturally, anybody would see this as a chance to get a cute girlfriend like Shiho, but since Keiki was a complete novice to love, he couldn't judge what the right answer here was.</p>
<p class="null-p">With his Senpai still clinging to his arm, the Kouhai had completely frozen in place. And the thing that broke this scene was a voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he focused his sight on the direction where the voice came from, he found Mizuha standing there, wearing a comfy looking sweater, a skirt, and tights. She seemed to be on her way home from a shopping trip, seeing as she was holding her beloved eco bag in her hand. Before Mizuha's mouth opened again, Shiho quickly separated from Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're Keiki-kun's little sister, right? Good evening." "Good evening…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, Mizuha would always give a bright greeting to anyone, no matter the situation, but just this once, she almost looked disheartened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, were you on a date with Takasaki-senpai?" "Ah, yes. I'm planning on escorting her home now."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, the older brother started talking very politely. He sensed some kind of pressure emanating from his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Then, try to come home directly once you've done that, okay? I'll</p>
<p class="null-p">be waiting for you, and I'll have dinner ready." "Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the less sibling-like and more superior-subordinate-like conversation, Mizuha gave a slight bow, said "Excuse me," and walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your little sister is as cute as ever, Keiki-kun." "I'm very proud of her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you don't really look like siblings at all." "We're not actually blood-related."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho seemed very surprised at the sudden revelation.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, thanks to the sudden appearance of Mizuha, the conversation about really going out with each other was left hanging.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: There is always but one truth</p>
<p class="null-p">It was morning on the beginning of a new week. Keiki had finished washing his face and was making his way to the living room when he was greeted by his little sister, who was wearing an apron.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, good morning, Nii-san." "Morning, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">They exchanged a short greeting. Keiki felt like drinking some milk, so he headed to the kitchen corner where Mizuha was. When he did, he spotted the lunch box that was lying on top of the kitchen corner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm, Mizuha?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't today's lunch box a bit too… Extravagant?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, it was a full-fledged multi-tiered lunch box. There was hamburger and spring rolls, spinach with sesame sauce, omelet and more. The heavy- looking lunch box was filled with her older brother's favorite foods.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san looks like he'll give in to Takasaki-senpai soon. As her rival in love, I have to use every technique at my disposal, even if it's through Nii-san's stomach."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rival in love…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, her words sounded sharper than usual, even though she was</p>
<p class="null-p">talking like always.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh… Are you mad after all that I didn't say anything because of the date?" "I'm not mad about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, it's not very pleasant to know that you're going on a date with another girl. But, if I were to restrict you too much, you'd start hating me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I want you to help me with my nude photoshoot in the future." "I doubt that there is a world where an older brother would accept that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had crossed the borders of being a brocon, and was deep in the land of full-fledged perversion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Mizuha, you stopped going to school without wearing panties, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Mizuha was an exhibitionist, she'd often go to school with no panties if her frustration reached a certain level to release some stress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not doing it anymore. Nii-san told me that I should stop, after all." "That's fine, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Instead, I'm going to school while wearing my treasured winning pair of</p>
<p class="null-p">panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that really fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hesitated before even ordering them online." "Now I'm even more worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what kind of panties were they that even an exhibtionist had hesitated before buying them?</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not as great as going with no panties, but it still felt very immoral, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this rate, my little sister will turn into a female molester…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, she had already started down the slippery slope the moment she had turned into an exibitionist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, anyways. Just do a normal lunch box, please. You don't have to do that much. You've already captured my stomach, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki put his hand on Mizuha's head and softly started stroking it. "Thank you for always making such delicious lunch boxes for me." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Slightly flustered, but still happy, Mizuha returned a gleeful smile. "For Nii-san, I'll make a multi-tiered lunch box like this every day." "Don't."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't feel like he would be able to eat that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">That very day on lunch break. In the back of the school building, down an empty hallway, Sayuki and Yuika were peering into an empty classroom. Naturally, the people they were spying on were Shiho and Keiki, who were sitting on chairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Meeting like this in secret makes us feel like Romeo and Juliet, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we did this out in the open, the stalker might try something, after all." "By the way, your lunch box was today was crazy luxurious, right?" "It's Mizuha's special creation."</p>
<p class="null-p">While holding that sort of small talk, they nonchalantly opened up their vending-machine pouches of coffee and enjoyed those as well. Ever since their date, Sayuki and Yuika couldn't help but be interested in the relationship between Keiki and Shiho, which was why the two of them were overseeing the couple as much as they could.</p>
<p class="null-p">"(It's vexing seeing them this close…)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(Keiki-senpai deserves some scolding later…)"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Sayuki and Yuika, Keiki was a future master/slave candidate. Seeing that very boy enjoying himself in a secret relationship with another girl was a severe blow against the pride of these two perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">While they were eavesdropping on Shiho and Keiki, they were whispering back and forth to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"(But if we were to become a nuisance, Keiki-kun would hate us.)" "(That's true. And that isn't what Yuika wishes for.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Sayuki, who wanted Keiki to become her master, and Yuika, who saw Keiki as her ideal slave, didn't want him to hate them. Because that might destroy all the chances they had left.</p>
<p class="null-p">"(Also, Koga-san, can you move to the side a bit? If you push your face in there too much, they'll spot you.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(Same to you, Witch-senpai. Your cow tits have been pressing against Yuika's back for a while, and they're heavy.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(It's not like I wanted them to get this big-Ah, this is bad?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two girls that were watching through the opening of the door quickly leaned back. Shiho, who was still sitting in the middle of the classroom, gazed over at the door and gave a slight smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai? Is something wrong?" "No, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought that something was off, but he didn't press any further. "(…That woman. She must've realized that we're here.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, she hadn't told Keiki about it. If she was really aiming for the boy, she'd see the rest of the calligraphy club as a bother. All she had to do was tell Keiki about the two girls spying on them, and his affection for them would surely drop, which would benefit her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering that, Takasaki Shiho's actions were a mystery. For the two girls, it felt like they were playing right into her hands, which didn't sit right with them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"(Keiki-senpai is being deceived by that woman. There has to be a hidden motive behind her approaching him so quickly and directly.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(You're right. But whatever her motive might be, I won't allow things to progress any more than this.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(If Keiki-senpai got a girlfriend, it would completely ruin Yuika's slave plan, after all.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(Even my future life as a pet is in danger.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their final goals might differ, but Keiki getting a girlfriend would be troublesome for both of them. Hence, until that bothersome insect who was approaching their target was dealt with, they would work together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because she knew their plans, or maybe on a whim, Shiho said the following.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, right. Keiki-kun?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm free from any student council work today, you know." "Oh, really? That means we can go home early today." "Yeah… And also, you see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My parents are coming home late today…" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how about you stop by my place today?" "(Wha-?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho's invitation left Sayuki and Yuika speechless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We haven't done it at all lately… So I've had to hold back this whole time…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So please… Let's do it lots today… All right?" "(Hold on-?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately following Shiho's bold exclamation, the perverts started to panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"(W-What's this about?! She's totally seducing Keiki-senpai, isn't she?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(I-It's fine, Koga-san! Keiki-kun was able to withstand my seducing, so he surely won't give in here…!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inviting someone over with no parents home can only mean one thing. There was only one thing to do if a boy and a girl were alone in a room with nobody to bother them. However, though they didn't know about Shiho, they knew that Keiki was a die-hard virgin. With his old-fashioned "I want to give my first time to a girl I love" attitude, they couldn't imagine that he would give in that easily to Shiho's temptations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(You'll definitely say no. Right, Keiki-kun?!)" "(Yuika believes in you, Keiki-senpai!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them patiently waited for Keiki's response. "I understand. I'll stay a bit longer today, then." "(Keiki-kun?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(Keiki-senpai?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their hopes and dreams were completely shattered in mere seconds. The girls' prayers didn't reach him, and Keiki's plans for the day were decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm looking forward to it… Fufu~" "(Ehhh?!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very end, Shiho once again smiled in the general direction of the door that the girls were peeking through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"(It seems like we have to deal with this immediately.)" "(Yes. At this rate, Keiki-senpai will be eaten by this vixen!)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their time limit was that day after school. They had to avert this worst-case</p>
<p class="null-p">scenario at all costs until it was time for the boy and girl to head home. "(Fufufu, this is to save my Master, so I can go a bit more rampant, right?)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"(Ahaha, Yuika will teach Keiki-senpai that he doesn't need any other girl but her.)"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both their eyes were radiating insanity. Naturally, there was no reason to doubt the scariness of the two perverts after all this time. And Keiki currently had no idea about the fear that was slowly but steadily approaching him.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Classes had ended for the day, and Keiki was in the hallway on the second floor that connected the school buildings, together with Mao. Standing there face to face with Keiki, Mao spoke with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, I have a favor to ask." "What kind of favor?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do a princess-carry." "With Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"With Akiyama, of course. Are you dumb?" "Don't say that like it's obvious…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one responsible for the steady supply of BL in the calligraphy club was as energetic as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">After homeroom ended, Mao called out to Keiki as soon as he went to step out of the room, and brought him here against his will.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, let's save the jokes for later." "Your eyes look dead serious, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, are you going home with the student council prez again today?" "Yeah, the thing about the stalker still hasn't been cleared up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"About that stalker, how long is this going to last? I heard from Mizuha that there hasn't been any progress at all, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few days had passed since Keiki and Shiho started their fake relationship, but they still haven't gotten any hints about the stalker. Not to mention that the stalker had not once showed their face in front of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There hasn't been any other creepy photos since then, so I really don't know what this guy is even plotting…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then maybe the stalker has a different goal than just following Kaichou around?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, the stalker is probably in love with Kaichou, right? Shouldn't he instead be holding a grudge against you, and not her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had gotten a threatening email once, but there hadn't been anything worse than that. This was probably that uncomfortable feeling that he had. This stalker hadn't gotten in contact with Keiki aside from the emails. If he wanted Keiki to break up with Shiho, couldn't he use more efficient methods?</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I were the stalker, I'd put thumbtacks in your shoes or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds painful just thinking about it… But that would be pretty showy of him to do that, so maybe he's just trying not to get caught?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If he were that much of a coward, he wouldn't send you those emails in the first place. I feel like he's just trying to meddle…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Meddle…"</p>
<p class="null-p">So the stalker's target wasn't Shiho? Then what exactly might he be aiming for?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the only thing you can do is catch the stalker and ask him personally." "I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But don't force yourself to much. If something happened to you, I'd…" "Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's nothing. Just keep playing the princess' knight, alright?" "Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And once everything's done, go be Akiyama's knight." "I'll have to pass on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Giving a faint smile at that reponse, Mao turned around. Since her business with Keiki was done, she immediately walked away. She was a perfect tsundere, seeing that she was honestly worried about her friend, but was unable to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">After separating from her, Keiki headed to the entrance to meet up with Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai might be waiting already."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were planning to meet up at the shoe lockers today. Since they had always left late all the previous times he had escorted her home, it felt weird, but also fresh, to walk home when it was still bright outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he arrived at the shoe lockers, there were no signs of Shiho yet. Hence, Keiki decided to go ahead and put on his outdoor shoes to wait for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There aren't any thumbtacks in there, right?" Keiki muttered to himself as</p>
<p class="null-p">he slowly opened up the shoe box.</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, there weren't any. Instead, a single piece of paper was lying on top of his shoes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Picking up the piece of paper, he read the short sentence that was written on there with horrific handwriting.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I have Takasaki Shiho. Come to the nurse's office, alone.' The contents informed Keiki of the worst case scenario. "Takasaki-senpai is in danger?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His body moved faster than his thoughts could follow. While sprinting towards the nurse's office at full speed, Keiki cursed his own naivety. Since there hadn't been any grave danger up until now, he had let down his guard. Even though the other person was dangerous enough of an individual to send voyeuristic pictures, Keiki had thought that things would end there.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had to save her immediately-</p>
<p class="null-p">Hence, the knight in shining armor ran towards the destined location as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Takasaki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki barged into the nurse's office. While trying to keep his rough breathing under control, he scanned his surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nobody's here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not a single human figure was to be seen whatsoever. It was still bright outside, but the room was filled with darkness, with the curtains covering the windows. The curtains of the individual beds were also pulled close, not enabling any view inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Over here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A bag was lying next to one bed, almost asking Keiki to move closer. Suddenly, the curtains sprung open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome~" "Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What greeted him was the familiar sight of a bear costume. It was sitting on top of the bed and waving its hand at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Bear-sama here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course he knew about the costume. It was the one that Sayuki had worn the other day during the culture festival.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this… Is a trap?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu, it's already too late! …Now, Rabbit-san!" "Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the bear said that, the curtains next to that bed opened, and someone in a rabbit costume jumped out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprised by the arrival of a new face, Keiki's reaction was too late, and he was caught between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew that this was a trap the moment he had found the piece of paper. However, he didn't anticipate that he would be ambushed by two people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, stay calm!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing bad will happen if you are a good boy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">From then on, Keiki was unable to resist. With their combined efforts, Keiki was pushed down on the bed by the two costumed people, and his hands were tied to the bed, with no way for him to escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did it end up like this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had just wanted to save Shiho, since she had fallen into the bad guy's hands. But now, two costumed people had caught him instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rabbit-san, please lock the door." "Will do~"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the bear asked him to, the rabbit headed towards the door. Soon after</p>
<p class="null-p">that, Keiki heard the rattling sound of the door being locked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Captain Bear-san! The door has been locked, so there's no chance of the prisoner escaping!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work. This went perfectly, Rabbit-san." "What's going on…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There were so many things that Keiki wanted to ask about that he just gave up on everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"With this, nobody will bother us."</p>
<p class="null-p">After they said this, both of them slowly took off the head parts of their costumes. What appeared beneath them were the black hair of a beauty, and the blonde hair of a cutie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai… Yuika-chan…" "Fu fu fu. Are you surprised?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I already knew it was you from the sound of your voices."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was more shocked that they thought their identities were hidden. "Ah, don't worry about Takasaki-san. The part about having captured her</p>
<p class="null-p">was just a lie. She should be going around searching for you around now, I'd assume."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd be really bad if we kidnapped the student council president, after all. We know that much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you really talk about common sense in a situation like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, he was bound down on a bed by two high school girls he knew. But that aside, there was one thing that Keiki had to ask no matter what.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just to make sure, you two weren't stalking Takasaki-senpai, right?" "Excuse me? What are you talking about, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The only one Yuika's interested in is Keiki-senpai. As if she'd do something as useless as that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that makes sense, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like the two of them really were unrelated to the stalker who was following Shiho around. Not to mention that Keiki had received the email from the stalker while both of them were busy with the pocky game.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I'm glad. It seems like Takasaki-senpai is safe.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though his own situation hadn't improved in the slightest, Keiki couldn't help but feel relieved. But that brought up an even bigger question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Then why would you tie me up like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If they didn't call Keiki here because they were the perpetrators, then why would they tie him up like this? And why were they wearing costumes?</p>
<p class="null-p">The more he thought about it, the more this situation didn't make any sense to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, that's pretty obvious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're going to take Keiki-senpai back."</p>
<p class="null-p">Throwing a smile at the perplexed Keiki, the two of them pulled the zipper of their costumes down, taking them off in one go.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't help but let out a shocked voice. After all, both of them were wearing only a bra and panties underneath their costumes, nothing more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was wearing cute-looking pink combo, while Sayuki was wearing a more grown-up blue design.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait wait wait?! What are you thinking, stripping at school like that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We strip at school all the time, though? Like when we're changing for gym class."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right now you're doing it in the nurse's office in front of a boy, though!" "Don't sweat the small stuff, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">With Yuika's words as something of a starting signal, the two girls started climbing onto the bed. They were in front of the tied-up boy, slowly crawling towards him like cats, slowly unbuttoning Keiki's blazer and blouse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, let us help you with your clothes, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stripping down a boy like this is pretty exciting in its own right, isn't it?" "What are you planning on doing if someone sees us like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to worry. No student can get in here now that the room is locked, and Tachibana-sensei is on a date with her boyfriend today. She was</p>
<p class="null-p">really happy when she went home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with this thoroughly-planned crime?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki still didn't know their intentions, they seemed serious. Shortly afterwards, the final button of his blouse was opened, revealing his naked chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, if two naked girls like us attacked him at the same time…" "Even Keiki-senpai wouldn't be able to hold back, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweet voices were leaking off their mouths, and both their bodies were</p>
<p class="null-p">pressing against Keiki's. "Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their breasts, only hidden by thin underwear, their naked bellies, their incredibly soft skin… Keiki found himself wrapped in an unknown feeling of comfort.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How does it feel to have two girls service you like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wouldn't do this to any other person besides her slave Keiki-senpai, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With sweet temptations leaking out of their mouths, the girls on his left and right both kissed him on the cheek at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuwaaaaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's ability to reason was nearly crushed by the sudden development.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is this heaven?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Or is this one of those famous shops that Keiki had heard about? No, this was but the nurse's office of the school he was attending. Inside this institution</p>
<p class="null-p">meant for young people to study and prepare for their future lives, he was being seduced by two half-naked girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you cut ties with that girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can do whatever you want with us, okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their soft, slender hands were slowly moving down Keiki's chest, over his belly, until they arrived at his belt. They slowly started removing that as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really don't know when to give up, Keiki-kun." "Right! Just keep quiet and let us handle the rest!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't take this as a joke if you're trying to take off my pants, you know?!" "Pants? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. We're also going to take off your underwear as well." "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tried his best to resist, but since his hands were tied, he wasn't able to do much in that regard. In the meantime, the belt came flying off as well, his zipper was pulled down, and his pants were thrown off completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu… I can't become a husband anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cute. Keiki-senpai is crying just because we took off his pants. Yuika is getting really excited here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Having Master be the one on the receiving end at times isn't too bad, I have to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you demons?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tying someone up to reveal their underwear is not something any normal</p>
<p class="null-p">human would do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, all that's left are the underwear." "No, not my underwear!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do. Before that woman can do it, we'd rather take Keiki-kun's virginity ourselves."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? Virginity?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki twitched at the word that Sayuki spoke. That was something that he couldn't ignore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on a second? What do you mean by my virginity being taken?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just as I said… You were talking with her during lunch break today. You said that you'll be going to Takasaki-san's house today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what we said, but… Wait, you were listening in on us?" "N-No…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's obviously a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway, there's no use trying to hide it! Takasaki-san said things like 'I've been holding back this entire time' and 'Let's do it lots, okay!', so you're probably going to have sex, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly! At this rate, Keiki-senpai will really go out with Takasaki-senpai, so Witch-senpai and Yuika decided to try one last effort to save you from her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It finally clicked in Keiki's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just so you know… We were talking about playing games."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We promised to play games together before. But since Takasaki-senpai is so busy with her student council work, we didn't have the time. Since she doesn't have any work to do today, we were going to play some video games today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence. Complete and utter silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">An awkward atmosphere filled the room. The first one to break was the red- faced Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But! I thought that if you ended up with Takasaki-san, you might not become my master anymore!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not planning on becoming your master either way." He rejected his upperclassman straightforwardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You only have to show your tail to Yuika, Keiki-senpai!" "I'm not a dog, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He also did so with his Kouhai. "Thinking about it rationally…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We did something outrageous, didn't we…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls' heads seemed to have finally calmed down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you understand, then put on some clothes already, you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, untie me and let me put my pants back on, I beg you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I will immediately put my clothes back on again…" "Yuika is very sorry to have troubled you like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them acted like completely different people as they climbed down from the bed while apologizing. They quietly released the bindings on Keiki's arms, put on their costumes including headpieces, and left the nurse's office. They probably were headed towards one of the school's changing rooms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Imagine if a teacher saw this happen…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Worst-case scenario, they would get suspended from school.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was really bad… in a lot of ways…</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been attacked by two underwear-clad girls. That kind of situation that he never would've dreamed of made his heart beat like crazy, but he decided to keep quiet about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, he put on his pants and fastened the belt back on top. "Ah, right. I have to inform Takasaki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">They had plans to go home together after all. Right now, she should still be waiting for her Kouhai to arrive. Hence, he quickly took out his smartphone and dialed her number. At the same time that he pressed the button to call her, a melody that resembled a ringtone rang out in the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that sound…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound was coming from a locker in the corner of the room. Still holding his own phone to his ear, Keiki walked over and opened the door to it. When he did, along with cleaning supplies, he found Takasaki Shiho stuffed in there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai?!" "Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was holding her smartphone in her hand, her uniform was messed up all over the place, her blouse's buttons were undone, and the valley of her chest was peeking out. Her skirt was flipped up, revealing her white skin. Her cheeks were flushed so much that she must be burning up. Her breathing was rough, and sweat was running down her cheek.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Were you locked in here?! Don't tell me, did Sayuki and Yuika do this?!" "Ah… No, you're wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">When her Kouhai asked her this, the girl awkwardly shook her head. "This is… Umm, I went in here of my own accord."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, you did this yourself? …Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't understand one bit. In what situation would you hole yourself up in a locker by yourself?</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh?! Were you being attacked by the real stalker?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! N-No, not that either! There's no one like that to begin with!" "Huh? There's no one like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, oops…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho quickly closed her mouth, but it was already too late. Keiki had already heard her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean that there's no one like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… I don't think I can hide it anymore…" Shiho said with a saddened sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">She once again raised her head, and she spoke clearly. "The thing is, I'm actually that stalker."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the most unbelievable confession she could've made in that situation. Shown on the screen of her smartphone was the perfect proof of that, namely the emails that the perpetrator had sent Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, the nurse's office was enveloped in a very awkward and gloomy atmosphere. Having fixed her clothes, Shiho was sitting at the end of the bed, and Keiki was seated next to her, a clouded expression decorating his face. The curtains were open now, but Keiki didn't feel like anything looked brighter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I was doing everything myself." "Everything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, everything. The lie about there being a stalker. Or rather, I was acting as the stalker, sending Keiki-kun those emails."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, that voyeuristic-looking photo of you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was taken by one of my classmates as a prank, and I decided to use it for that. Back during our date, I was pretending to take a picture of Tokihara- san and Koga-san, but I was actually sending you another email."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That would explain it. But what he didn't understand was- "Why would you lie to me like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because I love Keiki-kun~" "Serious talk, please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the thing is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her coy smile disappeared immediately. After a short moment of silence passed, the girl opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, don't you think that another person's belongings are really appealing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do. I think that other people's belongings look wonderful, and it makes me want them even more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki… senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, I have a netorare fetish." "Huh? N-Netorare?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't know what that is? It's a situation where you steal another person's partner, and get your partner stolen as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I got the general gist of it, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Netorare, or NTR for short, was a special kind of fetish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back in middle school, there was a boy that I had a crush on, and he started going out with another girl. And then, I saw them kissing in the classroom by chance…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really sad, yes, but at the same time, I was also really excited. So much so that I could barely believe it myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you get it? 'So vexing! But it still feels good!' That kinda thing." "I'm sorry, I have literally never felt that way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's fine. I know that I'm a special case." "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After that, all my romance interests were boys with girlfriends. It didn't matter if they were good-looking, cool, or kind. If he didn't have a girlfriend, I wouldn't feel anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shiho confessed that, her eyes turned towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I recently found the perfect boy. That boy is you, Keiki-kun." "Eh, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun is liked by so many girls, right? Tokihara-san and Koga-san, Nanjou-san and your little sister. Airi-chan's slowly starting to open her heart towards you, you're pretty close to Ayano-chan, and Rin-chan seems like he looks up to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rin-chan is a boy, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You remember when Airi-chan showed me that picture of the calligraphy club, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, the one from the bunny girl incident…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Under Sayuki's command, everyone had been attacking Keiki while wearing bunny girl suits, and that very moment was captured in a picture by Airi. She then immediately ran to Shiho and asked for the calligraphy club to get disbanded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I saw you surrounded by bunny girls like that, I thought 'Ah, this boy might work.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"All the way back then?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This meant that she had her eyes on him for a long time now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You weren't going out with anyone, but you were still approached by so many girls, so I thought that the netorare play might be the greatest with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, when you were provoking Yuika-chan and the others…" "That was all to stir up their jealousy for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I purposefully told Airi-chan about our date as well, because I thought that she would definitely tell Koga-san. In the end, everything worked out as planned. Even the pocky game, with the pocky sticks that I had prepared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara-san and Koga-san were really cute~" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for Shiho pretending to be a stalker was to play lovers with Keiki and make the girls from the calligraphy club jealous. It seemed like Mao's hunch was on point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The whole thing about the stalker was just a lie from the very beginning. I thought that the kindhearted Keiki-kun would never decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That explains why we never saw the perpetrator." The target was the stalker herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first, I was just planning to test things out. To see if I could really get the best netorare ever going, and the jealous girls were all so cute that I just…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho started fidgeting nervously with her cheeks bright red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even before, when I thought that I was going to get NTR'd by Tokihara-san and Koga-san, my heart was beating like crazy, and I got so excited that I did it alone in the locker…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did what?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">So the reason her uniform was all over the place was…? Since Keiki could guess the rest, he decided not to press her any further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, I was craaaaaaaaaaaaaazy wet." "What a perverted thing to do?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sadly, the members of the student council were all perverts as well. But</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho's fetish was even worse than all of the others'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I really panicked when you called me just now. How could I forget to put my phone on silence like that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Why did you even know about their plans in the first place? You were inside the locker even before things escalated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I realized that the two of them were watching us during lunch break. I used an easy-to-misinterpret way of phrasing things, and just watched their actions from then on. For example, I saw them put that piece of paper in your shoebox."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're talking like an actual stalker right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what you'd expect from the student council president. Thorough work all the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I didn't think that they'd attack you while only wearing underwear, okay? It must've felt pretty good, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No comment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, Keiki now knew the real identity of Shiho. A kind Onee-san? A normal person?</p>
<p class="null-p">Never. The girl Takasaki Shiho was more than abnormal. She had a fetish that bordered on insanity. She was a full-fledged pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like I could get my share of NTR with you, so how about we go out for real?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decline!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? What a shame~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sounding slightly disappointed, the girl lowered her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about keeping quiet all this time. But I wasn't lying when I said that I was enjoying my time with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, keep my hobby a secret from everyone, okay? The girls from the student council have no idea about this, and if you tell them, then I'd have to reveal everything about Tokihara-san and so on as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I thought so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had heard the words 'Slave' and 'Master' earlier, after all. Just from that, Shiho would probably be able to deduce their fetishes. With a long stretch, Shiho jumped up from the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go home alone today. Now that you've found out, there's no need for you to escort me home anymore, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that I did something horrible to you, and I know that I'm not in the position to say this, but I really wish we could play some games together at some point."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's face did look apologetic, and Keiki did promise her after all… "Okay, that should be doable."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he realized it, he had gotten up from the bad as well, and he said that. For Shiho, that surely must've been like a small miracle. After all, she was now looking at Keiki with wide eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…? After all that I did to you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the same for me. Although I wish that things hadn't ended up like this, I still enjoyed my time with you, Takasaki-senpai. And I did promise that we'd play games together at some point."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't… hate me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm still putting up with Sayuki-senpai and Yuika-chan, you know? I wouldn't hate the person I liked just because she's a bit of a pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki spoke these words, the girl's eyes opened wide. "…Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you want to go out for real after all?" "I'll hold off on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki went over to Shiho's place. He played a monster hunting game with the girl, and their promise to play games together was fulfilled that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The stalker incident came to an end, and it was the following day after the fake lovers act with Shiho came to an end. Keiki and Mizuha were walking to school next to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san, you seem to be in a good mood today." "Is that so? Well, I might be, ehehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just seeing that cute and happy expression helped cheer Keiki up a bit. Apparently, she seemed to be glad that the whole incident with Shiho was finally over, and she had been like this all the time after Keiki had told her about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Mizuha-san, what colour are your panties today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"White."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The pure ones?" "The super pure ones." "Alright, you pass!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but you definitely don't, you siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning towards the cold voice that had made that comment, he met eyes with a glaring Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asking your little sister about the color of her panties makes you a pervert of an older brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't say anything in my defense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki certainly didn't expect a fujoshi to reason about common knowledge, he decided to keep quiet since for once she was in the right.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Mao-chan." "Morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">After exchanging a short greeting, Mao whispered to Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You be careful okay? You don't have to pay attention to Kiryuu's sexual harassment, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can hear you over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki only had don this panties check to make sure that her secret hobbies wouldn't escalate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'm actually pretty happy that Nii-san is sexually harassing me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, Mizuha is like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three of them started walking to school together, and they happened to meet up with Sayuki and Yuika at the school gate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara? How weird for the whole club to be gathered here this early." "Witch-senpai normally barely makes it in time for class, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san, can you drop the false accusations? I come to school every day with a lot of time left."</p>
<p class="null-p">They two of them were having their usual friendly fight with each other. "Prez and Yuika are actually good material if I just turn them into boys." "What's wrong with your head, seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki responded to the fujoshi's the scary statement, "Everyone's so cheerful this early in the morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">As the four of them were happily conversing with each other, Mizuha said this in a cheerful tone of voice. There was one more figure who was closing in on them with light feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Keiki-kun!" "Good morning, Takasaki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho's wavy hair was fluttering as she greeted Keiki with a smile. "…."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other hand, the four girls were watching the intruder with wary expressions on their faces. The NTR fetishist accepted that gaze with a grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see that Keiki-kun is as popular as ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's really not like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? That means that I still have a chance, right?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a very easily misinterpretable comment, Shiho closed in on Keiki and suddenly clung to his arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone else just let out a shocked groan as they watched the scene unfold, when,</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better be prepared, alright? If you show the slightest opening, I'll definitely steal you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Please go easy on me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While the other four girls shot him envious gazes, Keiki couldn't help but let out a fed-up sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Classes had ended, and after stopping by the supermarket on her way home, Mizuha had a bag full of tofu and milk from the special sale, and a beaming expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big catch, big catch, tonight we'll have mapo tofu~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Mizuha and Keiki couldn't eat food that was too spicy, so mild spicy mapo tofu was perfect for them. It was the same with the curry, which they always made mild-spicy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Nii-san really likes his meat and potato stew on the side."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that her older brother's taste in food hadn't changed after all this time made Mizuha smile. Since she had been making food for him ever since they were little, she knew every preference that Keiki had for food, inside and</p>
<p class="null-p">out. Hence, thinking up a tasty menu for him was one of her most enjoyable pastimes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If I could, I'd love to cook for him for the rest of our lives…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a small voice, she whispered that dear wish of hers as she continued to walk down the street. She passed a certain small park along her way, but there she saw something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mizuha spotted a familiar face, she came to a stop. In front of a bench in the park, a familiar twin-tailed high school friend of hers was moving her hands in a panic. Now that she had spotted her, she couldn't ignore that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hence, she made her way to said bench to confront the girl. "What's wrong, Airi-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mizuha-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Airi turned over to look at Mizuha, her eyes looked similar to a small puppy that had been left alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Past the girl's gaze, sitting on top of the wooden bench, was yet another girl that Mizuha knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai?" "Ah… Mizuha-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her small stature was completely hidden by Airi crouching down in front of her. The hoodie-wearing girl had the hoodie pulled up over her head as she looked up at Mizuha. Her face was drenched with tears, and her eyes were bleary and red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mizuha asked that, Koharu nodded slightly and choked out a response. "…I had a fight with Shouma-kun."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Excuse me, but my younger boyfriend is totally interested in real grade school girls</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a certain weekday, once classes had come to an end, and it was an incident on the way home. That day, Koharu and Shouma, who had started dating around two months ago, were going home together as intimately as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, what happened with Kiryuu-kun and Kaichou-san in the end?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, the thing with the stalker came to an end, he said. That's why there was no need to pretend to be lovers anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Takasaki-kaichou seems even more interested in Keiki than before, it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was clinging to Kiryuu-kun early in the morning today, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though he might not realize it, Keiki is much more popular than me. Though all the girls are a bit special, so to speak."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe Kaichou-san is also a pervert?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows? It's plausible, though, since it's Keiki we're talking about."</p>
<p class="null-p">The couple with quite the great height difference were talking about their friend. As a side note, Ootori-san's recent worries consisted of things like</p>
<p class="null-p">"When we're walking together, other people think of us as siblings with a good age difference, rather than a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's invite Kiryuu-kun and Nanjou-san next time, as well." "Sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">The incident happened as the two of them were talking about whatever came to mind. A single grade school girl was in front of them, walking towards them. She seemed to be around ten years old, and was wearing a red backpack on her back. She was probably a 4th or 5h grader. She was about the same height as Koharu, and her glossy black hair was definitely eye- catching. The instant the girl passed Shouma, his feet came to an abrupt halt and he turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">His gaze was practically glued to that girl, and his lover Koharu looked at that Shouma with a confused gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That grade schooler just now…" "Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was crazy cute!" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I have never seen Shouma-kun ogle someone like that, Koharu thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would definitely cool down a love that would otherwise have lasted for millennia…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting on the bench in the park, Airi commented openly on the story that</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu had just told. Mizuha, who was also sitting on the bench, had a question instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what happened after that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I screamed 'Shouma-kun you idiot! You lolicon!' and ran away…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that certainly isn't something he can laugh off. Ogling another girl with his girlfriend right next to him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just as Mizuha-senpai says. Ootori-senpai didn't do anything wrong." "Mizuha-san… Nagase-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It greatly helped Koharu to have people with her who were understanding. Grateful that they understood what she was mad about, she wiped her still- teary eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Mizuha and Airi were sitting on the bench with Koharu between them. Mizuha was to her right, and Airi was to her left.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that Mizuha-senpai knows Ootori-senpai. I wouldn't know what to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, Nagase-san, for troubling you like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't pay it any mind. As a member of the student council, it's my duty to help out a student who finds themselves in trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she might still have reservations about men in general, Airi herself was a kind girl who wouldn't ignore someone who was hurting like Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But to think that Ootori-senpai's boyfriend was actually Akiyama-senpai… The world really is a small place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi-chan, you know about Shouma-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. He helped me out with some special training before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of special training?" "No, don't ask…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were special training sessions conducted by Keiki to lessen her hate for men, but she saw no reason to go into any further detail. She found herself almost smiling just from remembering the two of them in swimming trunks. Hence, she said the following to get back on track.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I understand the circumstances. So do you hate Akiyama-senpai now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way! As if I could hate him because of that!" "Even after he did something cruel like that?" "It's true that I was a bit irritated by it, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed to have remembered it again, and her face once again looked close to breaking out in tears. Still, she managed to keep her smile, and said…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though he might be a lolicon, and he lacks a lot of delicacy, he's still the Shouma-kun I love so much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Koharu's tear-jerking confession, Airi had trouble holding back her tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, can I pat your head, Senpai?" "Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I hug you?" "Even Mizuha-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Airi, Mizuha also voiced her wish. A second later, Koharu was tightly</p>
<p class="null-p">hugged and had her head patted by both of them.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">After enjoying this position for a while, Airi spoke up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, Akiyama-senpai really is the worst. He has such a cute girlfriend, and he still goes to ogle another girl. Not to mention a grade school girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Shouma-kun's interests can be a bit special."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha tried to respond in a way that calmed down the situation, but it didn't exactly work out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Losing against a grade school girl. I wonder if I don't have any charm as a woman…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. Ootori-senpai is really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, right. Senpai is crazy cute. So much so that I'd like to take you home with me right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Thank you very much… But, take me home?" Mizuha spoke up to try to get back to the main subject. "So what do you want to do right now, Ootori-senpai?" "I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to make up with Shouma-kun." "Yeah, I thought so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha knew Koharu's answer from the get-go. The only thing she had to do now was give her a gentle push on her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I said so many cruel things to Shouma-kun, so he's definitely angry at me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I don't think that Shouma-kun would get angry at you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu was definitely afraid to find out how Shouma felt about the whole thing. She was scared of being hated by the person she loved. Mizuha knew these sorts of feelings all too well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's think of ways to have you two make up!" "Is that fine with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. My home is really close, so come stop by. Airi-chan as well, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. Now that I'm here, I won't be able to rest easy if I don't see this through."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the two girls formed a group. Their goal was to help Koharu and the lolicon boy make up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, at a fast food restaurant near the school. Two friends were sitting across from each other, and both of them had a serious look on their faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's definitely your fault, Shouma." "Right. I think so too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy who sighed in frustration at himself was the aforementioned lolicon</p>
<p class="null-p">boyfriend, Akiyama Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akki-senpai is actually the worst, huh?" "Are you referring to me as Akki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to Keiki was the boy who was employed as the student council's secretary, happily munching on a french fry: The first-year Mitani Rin. Right now, he was wearing normal male student clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou seems to have the hobby of giving people weird nicknames." "That's fine and all, but why is he with us in the first place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just with him when you called out to me, Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">Around twenty minutes earlier, when Keiki happened to meet Rintarou by pure chance in the library to talk with him about big breasts, Shouma suddenly called him in a panic. Since it looked like an emergency situation, they decided to meet up at this store nearby to hold a meeting, where Shouma confessed about the fight between him and Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I knew Akki-senpai from before when we were all wearing swimming trunks. Also this looked interesting, so I thought I might as well join in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like those two things aren't exactly connected… Well, whatever."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Koharu had gotten angry at him, Shouma didn't have the time or mood to sweat the small stuff. He hadn't even touched the coke and fried potatoes he ordered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why did you call me here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to ask for advice from you, Keiki." "Advice about what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time that I've made Koharu get mad at me since we started going out. I don't know how to make her forgive me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki grasped the situation, but he would've appreciated it if Shouma weren't fidgeting like a maiden in love. That really wasn't a gesture that looked good when a man did it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't expect that. I always thought that Akki-senpai was brimming with experience."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you say, but Koharu-chan is my first girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai is that tiny girl, right? The one who always wears that hoodie?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, yeah, that's Koharu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she stood out in her own way, Rintarou seemed to know about her. "That girl is really cute. She's like a small animal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't hand her over, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, don't worry about that. I prefer big breasts, see." "What'd you say?! Small breasts are the best thing ever!" "Don't start that ancient debate…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akki-senpai doesn't understand anything! This voluptuous softness that can suck you in with a single touch is the symbol of femininity! Every man yearns to feel that in his life!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not true! The budding chest is supreme! Their growth still ongoing, or even left behind in their youth, is the most charming thing ever! The immoral feeling when you think about them is the best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They hadn't found any common ground, and the two of them started heating up even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Flat!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alrighto, you two. Let's leave it at that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that by themselves they'd never come to an agreement, Keiki acted as</p>
<p class="null-p">the arbiter to bring an end to their fight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The gazes of the women around us are really starting to hurt…" "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were in an open place, and having a heated discussion about breasts in such a place didn't exactly earn them respect in the eyes of society. Instead, they received cold gazes from the high school girls and office ladies around them. In order to run away from that, the boys quickly left the restaurant.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After they heard Koharu's circumstances, Mizuha took her and Airi to her home. Being the only one wearing her casual clothes would've been a bit awkward, so she changed into her school uniform. The three girls were now sitting on the cushions around the small table, and Koharu was drinking some hot chocolate just like the last time she had come over for love advice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've been inside Mizuha-san's room." "Last time we were in Nii-san's room, weren't we?" "That's Mizuha-senpai for you. It's so clean."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, I can't really relax if it's not clean."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha wasn't able to stay calm if there was a dusty place in her room. She did have a lot of things in her room, but keeping things in order was part of her hobby, so the room had a clean and proper girly feeling. Anyway, normally they'd be having some girl talk in such a situation, but there was a more pressing matter to navigate right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's start the meeting for the operation."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she had provided the location, Mizuha became the self-appointed president of this meeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today's topic is to help get Ootori-senpai and Shouma-kun to make up. So</p>
<p class="null-p">let's think of ways to achieve that."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mizuha opened up the meeting, Airi lifted her hand with a "Yes!" like she was still in school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, Airi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since this time it was completely Akiyama-senpai's fault, I think that she should wait until he comes to apologize! It's his responsibility as a man to do so!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. That makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, this whole incident had started with Shouma's problematic conduct. Ogling another girl while walking around with one's girlfriend wasn't exactly an admirable thing to do. Airi's opinion was that the other party should apologize for their misbehaviour, since Koharu didn't do anything wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think, Ootori-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… But I want to make up as soon as I can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand! Then let's work towards that direction!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Accepting Koharu's wish, Airi immediately retracted her previous idea. That was one of her negative traits. On one hand, she was harsh towards other boys. On the other, she was almost too soft towards girls. However, it certainly wasn't a bad trait to accept other people's wishes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's cross out the 'waiting for an apology' plan. Let's think of ideas for how to deal with this situation as quickly as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They raised their fists as one, but things wouldn't go any easier just because they were motivated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… This is pretty difficult…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Making up with a boy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's like you're trying to grab a cloud…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes passed, and the motivation they had before had been blown away. Their expressions were gloomy, and they were at a loss as to what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe our inexperience is the main problem here. I've never had a boyfriend before, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say that, but I've been trying to live my own life away from any boys in general."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, you two aren't making things better, you know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When both Mizuha and Airi said their almost depressing statements, Koharu started panicking as well. Maybe it was presumptuous of them to try and help someone with love troubles, since they had no experience themselves. But chickening out right now wasn't something that Mizuha could allow herself to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san would be happy to get some handmade cooking." "Mizuha-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well. Whenever I have a quarrel with Nii-san, I always make some of Nii-san's favorite food for dinner. By the time we're done eating, we've made up already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. That might be a good idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi agreed with Mizuha's constructive idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it would be tough to meet Shouma-kun face to face right now." "I see. That means that you can't give him a lunch box or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the general idea isn't too bad. If you do something that Akiyama-senpai</p>
<p class="null-p">would enjoy, you'll definitely be able to make up." "Something that Shouma-kun would enjoy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a ray of hope for Koharu. Now that their direction was decided, Mizuha regained her confidence and spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that's the case, then leave it to me. I know a method that will definitely lead to success, no matter what boy it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there really a method like that?!" "I-I'm intrigued…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Airi and Koharu voiced curiosity in response to that. Mizuha turned towards the two of them, shouldering their expectations, and opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seduce him." "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, the group of boys had left the fast food restaurant- "Sorry for intruding~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Searching for a place where they could talk in peace, they decided on Shouma's home. Though Keiki had been a guest here a few times already, it was the first time that Rintarou had been there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, the two of you can go ahead to my room. I'll get something to drink."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, can I borrow the toilet before that? I couldn't go at the restaurant." "Yeah, it's right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou visited the toilet, and Shouma went into the kitchen, so Keiki did as he was told and went up to Shouma's room on the second floor. It was the room of the boy that he had known for a long time now. After all this time, he saw no need to hold back, and he opened the door without knocking-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Sho-kun's smeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rolling around on Shouma's bed was a woman who was stuffing her face into the pillow. Beating her legs, wrapped in jeans, up and down, she was working her hardest to get a good whiff of the pillow that presumably belonged to Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi… san…?" "Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki cautiously called out to her, the girl finally noticed Keiki's presence. Still lying on the bed, Asahi's mouth opened and closed like a fish, until she finally muttered…</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Huh? Kei-kun?" "Hello."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hey, come on in." "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As an awkward silence filled the room, Asahi slowly got down from the bed. Just when he thought that she was walking like a zombie towards him, she suddenly grabbed the clothes on his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, Kei-kun! Don't tell Shou-kun!" "I don't particularly mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?! It's a promise, okay?! You're not allowed to tell him, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it already, so stop pulling on me like that, please."</p>
<p class="null-p">He got Asahi to let go of him, and quickly fixed his clothes. In the meantime, Asahi seemed to have calmed down a bit, and let out an embarrassed laugh. "Ahaha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, this is a bit embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'm used to this sort of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be weird for me to ask, but what exactly does your daily life look like?" Asahi asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a wonderful harem, of course. One filled to the brim with perverts. But of course, Keiki couldn't tell her that, so he avoided the topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, where's Shou-kun?" "He's currently preparing tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… by the way, Kei-kun?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, Yuuhi-chan has been acting a bit weird. Do you know anything?" "Yuuhi-san is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi was Asahi's twin sister, making her the second-oldest of the Akiyama siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's spacing out all the time, you see. Both at home and at school, like something's plaguing her. When I speak to her, she just gives me those random answers, with no energy at all. And also…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She started acting weird after she went to that culture festival at your school. I heard that she got drunk because her boyfriend ditched her, but she won't</p>
<p class="null-p">tell me in detail what happened that day, so I thought that maybe something happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ummmmmmm… Well, she was trying to seduce our students like a drunkard, but I wasn't with her the whole time, so I don't know everything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… I guess I can't help it, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-san, you really treasure Yuuhi-san, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Of course. She's my adorable little sister, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as much as the brocon Onee-san loved her younger brother, she equally treasured her younger sister. And, with that timing Rintarou came back from the toilet, and Shouma arrived with a tray in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-kun-senpai, thanks for waiting!" "Oh, why is Asa-nee here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-san was sniffing your pillow like crazy," Keiki said. "Didn't you promise not to tell him?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she was completely betrayed, Asahi started hammering on Keiki's chest. Shouma for his part just calmly put down the tray on the table, lined up the cups filled with oolong tea, and responded in an indifferent manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I already know that Asa-nee is doing stuff like that all the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that calm reaction?! I'd be happier if you got angry at me!" the university girl said. She started shaking with tears building up in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Rintarou was closely inspecting Asahi…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! I was wondering why you seemed so familiar! You were the molester back during the culture festival!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Molester?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't deceive me even if you cut your hair! You called out to me and all the other boys in my class! You're the perverted Onee-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't do anything like that, though?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she was accused for crimes she hadn't committed, Asahi was quite shocked. Since Keiki actually felt bad for her, he decided to clear things up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou, this isn't the molester. She's Asahi-san, the molester's older sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really? I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's fine. I'm sorry that my younger sister put you through so much trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing as the two of them looked like two peas in a pod, nobody could blame him for getting the wrong idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asa-nee, we got something important to talk about, so could you leave us alone for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okieee~ See you later."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly, she left immediately after Shouma asked her that, and she stepped out of the room while waving her hand at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Asa-nee is just too much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that she's a good older sister, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A good older sister wouldn't sniff her younger brother's pillow."</p>
<p class="null-p">The one troubled the most let out a sigh, and commented on Rintarou's opinion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Asahi-san is crazy beautiful. If she's really not the molester, I'd love to get closer to her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… I think that that would be a bit problematic." "Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's a crazy brocon who can only see her little brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like the Akiyama household doesn't have any proper people…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not counting the lolicon younger brother, there were two brocon sisters (one of them an open pervert), meaning that this was quite the adventurous family, to put it nicely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, back to our main topic. How can we fix Koharu-chan's mood?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's once again chance locations from the Akiyama household to the Kiryuu household, where Mizuha and the other girls were working on their seduction plan. Or rather, Koharu was still a bit perplexed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Seduce him…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. We're going to take lewd pictures of Senpai and bewitch Shouma-kun with those."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Betwitch Shouma-kun…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu's body twitched at the sweet sound of that. However, there was one person who wouldn't allow anything like that sitting right next to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm against that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, it was none other than Airi. "Why are you against it, Airi-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai is still young, you know? It's too early for her!" "Have you forgotten that you're calling me Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but-Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase-san suddenly had a revelation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hold on. If we're going to do this seducing plan thing, wouldn't I be able to look at embarrassing pictures of Ootori-senpai legally?</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase-san loved cute girls. For someone who loved yuri, this temptation right now…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-Well, Ootori-senpai is the one who should decide. If you want to do it, then I won't stop you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the strict student council member couldn't win against the temptation of perverted pictures.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But… I'm as flat as an anvil, and I don't have a nice body like Mizuha- san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. Ootori-san is really cute." "Mizuha-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Having a small stature is something like a status symbol. Not to mention that the other party is a lolicon, so if he were to see the cute Senpai in erotic pictures, Shouma-kun would definitely come running again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He'd come running…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's words were like the tempting whispers of the devil. Right now, Koharu felt a strong desire not to lose against a grade school girl. With the possibility of making Shouma happy on the line, unthinkable amounts of courage built up in the maiden's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I… I want to please Shouma-kun…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hence, she was determined to do everything for the person she loved. Seeing her resolve, Mizuha nodded in a satisfied manner and put her hands on Koharu's shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that that's decided, let's have you strip down." "Eh? I'm fine doing it by myself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, just think of it as practice." "What kind of practice?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu seemed a bit against it at first, but since Mizuha didn't show any signs of letting her go, she ended up stripping on front of them. They moved the table into the corner of a room, and Mizuha stood in front of Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">First, the hoodie and blazer. The removed clothes were draped on an empty chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next thing Mizuha put her hands on was the skirt. While Koharu started slightly shivering in embarrassment, Mizuha calmly unhooked the skirt, pulled the zipper down, and pulled the blue skirt off. The shoes followed shortly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ultimately, it was time for the blouse. Mizuha slowly opened button after button of Koharu's pure white blouse. Her chest was laid bare, revealing orange underwear, and Koharu's face turned bright red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is really embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to be embarrassed, though. We're all girls here." "Y-Yes…" Koharu nodded with a shaky voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were indeed only girls present in the room, but that didn't mean that a girl couldn't be just as dangerous as a boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha-senpai is taking off Ootori-senpai's clothes…!!!</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a yuri lover, Nagase Airi, present. While sitting on top of a cushion, Airi was watching the scene in front of her unfold with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time she takes off a piece of clothing, Mizuha-senpai's slender fingers run across Ootori-senpai's soft skin… Isn't this the epitome of sexual pleasure?!</p>
<p class="null-p">* It's not.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once all the buttons were undone, Mizuha freed Koharu of the blouse altogether.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai's chest is really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mizuha-san?! You can't touch me?!?!" "Guhaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">An immense pressure was crushing in on Airi's chest. To explain what was happening, Mizuha had walked behind Koharu, and was now fondling her small chest. Although it was still with her underwear on, it was still too much stimulation for Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, a situation like this would never be allowed to see if one were a boy, but it was fine since Airi was also a girl, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Being a girl… really is the best!</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Shortly after, through the influence of too much stimulation, Airi lost consciousness. Naturally, Mizuha immediately caught wind of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, did Airi-chan fall asleep?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She must be tired from the student council work, right?" "I'd feel bad if we woke her up, so let's let her sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha opened her closet, took out a large towel, and put it over Airi. "Alright then, let's start the photoshoot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, what kind of pictures will we be taking?" "Umm… pictures like these. How about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha took out her smartphone and showed Koharu a gallery of pictures. "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she saw those, her face went as red as a tomato. Shown on the screen were selfies that Mizuha had taken. Naturally, none of those could ever be leaked to the outside. While holding her smartphone in one hand, she was hiding the most important places of her naked body with the other hand. One finger alone was hiding her nipples and crotch.</p>
<p class="null-p">This method was called the 'One Finger Selfie.' Mizuha planned to use this technique to bewitch the lolicon boyfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what should I do to make up with Koharu-chan?" "Prostrate yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That or cut your belly open."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a bit extreme…"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the second floor of the Akiyama household, strange ideas were being thrown around. Other people might think that the two boys were being way too harsh on the girlfriend-having ikemen, but not considering what he had done that day. Also, the sight of the three boys sitting around the table talking like that was very surreal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… how to fix Koharu-senpai's mood, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After you ruin a girl's mood, you can either apologize immediately, or wait until she forgives you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I can't meet Koharu-chan all the time, I'll probably die from loneliness." "If you like Senpai that much, why were you ogling a grade school girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's the inner lolicon inside me coming out. I just couldn't help myself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Keiki knew that fixing a pervert wasn't that easy. It would probably be better to try and get him to make up with Koharu before they could try doing something about his lolicon tendencies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akki-senpai, if you're that much of a lolicon, why did you start dating a 3rd year Senpai like her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan was my stalker before." "Eh? Stalker?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Koharu-senpai has been stalking Shouma for around a year now." "One year?! …She looks very docile, but she's actually a hidden animal…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shouma recalled the times back then, he showed a bitter smile as he continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I first met Koharu-chan, I thought that she was an underclassman. Because of her hoodie, I couldn't see her 3rd year ribbon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that was something that I came up with."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah yeah. Keiki was playing our cupid back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">That had happened around half a year ago. Though it felt like it had been much longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When she first confessed to me, I turned her down after she told me that she was actually older than me, but we did start out as friends… And after spending time with her, of course I'd fall in love with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's got Akki-senpai's beloved flat chest, after all." "I can't deny that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, deny that even if you have to lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">You really are the worst-thought Keiki. He sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hearing all of this, I can see why Ootori-senpai would be so hurt, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She thought that she was losing once again because she's older, huh? She's not the type to have that much confidence in herself, either, so she must be worried that you'll start running after real lolis sooner or later…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-kun-senpai, does this mean…?" "Yeah, this is the worst-case scenario." "No way?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the reality hit, the lolicon held his head in his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-What should I do? Will I just be left alone by Koharu-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're holding this meeting to try to avoid that, okay?" "I'll help out as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki… Mitani-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had been their cupid before, it'd leave a bad aftertaste in Keiki's mouth if things ended like that. And, Keiki really liked Koharu as well. He didn't want to see her grieve, so he wanted to do everything he could for the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since this is completely your fault, you should show your good faith now, Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you have to do something that she would enjoy, and help fix her mood that way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something that Koharu-chan would enjoy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, what hobbies does Ootori-senpai have?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Shouma and Keiki looked at each other when Rintarou posed that question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan's hobby…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Taking secret photos of Shouma, I guess?" "She's quite the aggressive girlfriend, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou was a bit taken aback when he heard about Koharu's hobby.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But pictures don't sound like a bad idea. I think that Koharu-senpai would definitely be happy about something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then if I sent her a super-cool picture of me…" "You should be able to make up, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">But there was a fatal flaw in that plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that Koharu-chan already has tons of pictures of me, though?" "Oh right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the one year of her stalker activities, she had taken more pictures than you could probably count. Pictures of him walking to and from school, pictures of him doing club activities in his jersey, pictures of him sitting in the classroom waiting for the next class to start, everything. She had her own collection, and it wasn't a small one. If Koharu doesn't receive a picture that topped all of those, then things wouldn't change, presumably.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then it's gotta be a rare picture that she definitely doesn't have." "A picture that she doesn't have…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe a picture of Akki-senpai when he was still a child?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that sounds nice!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu couldn't have a picture like that yet. However, Shouma's reaction showed signs that it wouldn't work out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asa-nee and Yuu-nee gave Koharu-chan some pictures of me as a child before. She was really happy about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And we're back at the start, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you can't blame Asahi-san and Yuuhi-san for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was about the little brother they were so proud of, so of course they'd want to brag.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, the hurdle had only grown now that childhood pictures were no longer an option.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A rare picture of Shouma that Koharu-senpai doesn't have already…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A rare picture of me that Koharu-chan doesn't have…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two 2nd-year boys were wracking their minds. Shortly afterwards, their Kouhai came up with something new.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, the only thing left to do… is nudes, right?" "Nudes?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha, I'm sorry. Maybe that wasn't a good idea. Just forget about it." "No, that's not the problem…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, it might actually work?" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Getting nudes from Shouma… Koharu-senpai would be crazy happy about that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no mistaking it, yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of girlfriend is this woman?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A stalker who loved taking pictures, who'd be happy to get nudes. The image of Koharu inside Rintarou's head was becoming more and more twisted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, even if she's my girlfriend, sending nudes to her… one wrong step, and I might end up a pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That could very well backfire…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu would definitely be happy about it. But there still was a slim chance that she could be like "Sending me nudes like that is really weird…" and that would be even worse. It was a high risk, high reward thing to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If nudes is a no-go, then how about pictures of you in your underwear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's basically the same as naked." "Yeah, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, hold on."</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain idea came to Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about something that has the same amount of skin shown, but doesn't make you look like a pervert? A magical item!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I know…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma and Rintarou both realized what Keiki was playing at. "A swimsuit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, if they used swimming trunks instead of underwear, there would be no problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just send her a picture of you in your swimming trunks, and she'll definitely be happy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's take some pictures immediately!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the boys took camera into hand and started their mission to take the most amazing picture of Shouma in swimming trunks ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No no no no no no! I can't do that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I think that Shouma-kun would easily be won over if you sent him a picture like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I would die of embarrassment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mizuha showed her some samples of the kinds of pictures she was talking about, Koharu loudly protested.</p>
<p class="null-p">The One Finger Selfie.</p>
<p class="null-p">By using a mirror, you could hide both your nipples and crotch with but one finger. It was a very revealing way of taking a picture. The samples that Mizuha provided were so lewd that Koharu was left unable to even look at them. Even though they long crossed that line ever since Mizuha stripped Koharu down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm surprised that you can take pictures like these, Mizuha-san." "It feels really good once you get used to it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to get used to it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you can still decide if you want to send it or not, so how about we just take some pictures as a test?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's for Shouma-kun, Senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're enjoying this, aren't you, Mizuha-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, after telling her that it was all for Shouma, Koharu also stripped off her underwear. Bearing the immense embarrassment of going fully naked in a friend's house, Koharu received a lecture on how to properly take that special selfie, and tried it out by standing in front of the full-body mirror in Mizuha's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… Yeah, this is no good." "I-It's not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, how do I put it? Ethically?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ethically?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be blunt, it looks like child pornography." "Child pornography?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown on Koharu's screen was definitely a picture that could never be sent to another person. The reason for that was obvious. Koharu still looked like a grade school girl. She had a determined, yet embarrassed expression on her face, which almost made it look like she was forced to do this, and if someone saw this picture on Shouma's phone…</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Koharu wasn't completely naked during their conversation, but rather had a bath towel wrapped around her small body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess we should take the safe route, and have you wear underwear." "That's still pretty dangerous if you ask me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, they still took one to try it out. This time, Koharu didn't use the mirror, and just took a normal selfie. However, the finished picture was…</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is still pretty bad in it's own way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Shouma-kun had this picture of me, and someone saw this on his phone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She still looked like grade school girl no matter what. Hence, taking a picture even in underwear was too dangerous to spread. Her smile was perfectly normal, but the immoral feeling that it emitted was…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for having such an immoral body…" "Sorry, it's just because of my bad ideas."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu… I can't become a wife anymore…" Koharu cowered while looking at the photo of her in her underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But maybe it was a better idea to not send these pictures. He might think</p>
<p class="null-p">that you're a perverted girl, after all." "Oh so now you think about that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A complete 180. But better late than never. "Let's take a quick break. How does that sound?" "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please use the bed." "Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still wrapped in a bath towel, but now wearing underwear underneath it, Koharu sat down at the corner of the bed. Mizuha sat down next to her. It had already gotten dark outside, so she pulled the curtains together and turned the lights on. Meanwhile, Airi still was in the land of dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I really am good for nothing." "Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got angry at Shouma-kun just because he looked at another girl. Shouma- kun had already been ogling grade school girls before we started going out, but I never really took it to heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before I started going out with Shouma-kun, I could really only look at him. I thought that I would never fall in love with anyone but him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And now it's different?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Mizuha's question, Koharu softly smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There really is no limit to how much you can love someone. After becoming lovers and spending time together, my own feelings for him started to grow more and more. I love Shouma-kun even more than ever before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that, Mizuha felt really warm inside. She knew how Koharu felt, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The more I started falling in love with Shouma-kun, the more I couldn't forgive him if he was looking at other girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu's cheeks went red as she explained her complicated feelings, or at least as she tried to put them into words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I'm a bit envious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I want to dig a hole and hide in it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu looked really cute as she tried to hide her beet red face. Now that Mizuha had seen this, she couldn't sleep until Shouma and Koharu had made up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's think of other ways to help you two make up." "Yes! Ah… But please nothing too embarrassing…" "Ahaha, I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">They wouldn't rely on nudes to bewitch Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well I still think that bewitching in general isn't that bad of an idea…" "Shouma-kun is a boy after all, so of course he'd be interested…" "Naked isn't going to work, and neither is underwear…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The both were lost in thought, until… "Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They both arrived at the same answer the exact same moment. Something that had the same charming quality, but wasn't a legal problem in court. Yes, the name of that magical item was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"A swimsuit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, Shouma and Koharu could be seen together in the courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them were sitting next to each other on a bench, as if all that ruckus yesterday had never happened. And there were two people who watched over the lovey-dovey couple from the second floor in the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai and Shouma-kun managed to make up, huh?" "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two people were Keiki and Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that you girls thought of the same idea as we did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you normally don't exchange swimsuit pictures without planning it ahead of time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma ended up sending an apology message with the swimsuit picture, while Koharu sent a swimsuit picture at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw the background of the picture, i.e. Mizuha's room, Keiki realized that she was helping out Koharu just like he was helping Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma went crazy over that picture."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai was also really happy. She said that a picture of Shouma in his swimming trunks was super rare."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good thing that her driver picked out such a nice swimsuit for her." "So drivers do that if they're paid enough?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, the drivers at the Ootori household seemed to have it rough. But nevermind the driver, it was great that they had made up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of swimsuits, it might be nice if we all went to the pool again." "Pool…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Mizuha muttered that word, her cheeks became flushed. "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki also remembered, though a little too late. The pool was the place where the girl next to him had stolen his first kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I didn't mean it like that… Umm, I'm sorry." "No, it's fine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">An awkward atmosphere followed. Hence, Keiki immediately tried to change the subject.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That reminds me, why didn't Koharu-senpai wear a school swimsuit? Even though it'd probably fit her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, we did try that, but…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her wearing a school swimsuit was still too… immoral looking…" "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It might look too good on her, actually.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, even though Keiki tried to change the atmosphere, it didn't really</p>
<p class="null-p">succeed since now it was a different feeling of awkwardness between them. While trying to think about what he should do, Keiki felt his smartphone vibrate in his pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, an email." "From who?" "Yuuhi-san." "Another girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? No, she's Shouma's older sister, you know." "But, you like older women…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's really nothing going on between us."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was still dubious, but she didn't pry into it any further. "So what does she want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, the thing is-"</p>
<p class="null-p">After typing out his response, he lifted his head. "Apparently, I'll be drinking tea today with Yuuhi-san." "…Huh, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after, her dubious feeling returned stronger than before, and all the light in Mizuha's eyes disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">This was an incident that happened during Shouma's photoshoot the day before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to the toilet really quick," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood! Leave the camera to me!" "Take your time~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou had his phone in his hand like a professional photographer, and the lolicon was posing while wearing swimming trunks as Keiki stepped out of the room. Turning on the lights, he carefully went down the stairs. The moment he arrived at the first floor of the Akiyama household, the front door opened, and a long-haired, skirt-wearing Yuuhi came in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm back… Ah, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Yuuhi-san. Welcome back, I'm visiting right now." "K-Kei-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she saw Keiki's face, Yuuhi let out a shriek. Seeing her over-reaction, Keiki looked at her in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuuhi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm sorry. I hadn't mentally prepared myself to meet Kei-chan like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mentally prepared?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What did she mean by that? Keiki thought that Yuuhi seemed to be acting really weird. But he couldn't quite put it into words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi-san just said that Yuuhi-san was acting weird…</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw her like this, Keiki would understand why she would think that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she had something that she was troubled about? Naturally, he was interested, but after drinking too much oolong tea, he had his own share of problems.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I've gotta go now-"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was excusing himself to make his way to the toilet, "U-Umm, Kei-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi energetically called out to stop him. Since ignoring her was out of the question, he steeled his body to hold back on releasing the bodily fluid and turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… If you're okay with it, how about we go drink some tea together sometime?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tea?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I want to repay you for what I did at the culture festival." "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The culture festival incident she was most likely referring to was the fact that she had been going around crazy drunk. As a result, she had been targeted as a dangerous individual by the student council, and Keiki was the one who captured her. Following that, he heard her out while she was clinging to him, but things ended without much trouble and she was brought home by her family.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, really. You don't have to repay me or anything." "N-No way?! No, please, I won't be able to sleep otherwise!" "Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi suddenly became really adamant about it. But Keiki was nearing his limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. That sounds good to me." "R-Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Anyway, I really have to… or else…" "Or else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really at my limit, so please let me go to the toilet!" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki safely made it to the toilet, and Yuuhi apologized countless times to him once he came back. They then exchanged their contact information and promised to go drink tea together sometime.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: That's why we can't Love.</p>
<p class="null-p">The trigger was back when she went to the culture festival at her younger brother's school. She was rejected by the man she liked. Out of shock, she sought refuge in the world of alcohol. Her alcohol-addled mind decided 'Yeah, let's pick up some boys', and she headed to the private Momosawa High School, where young boys gathered at the culture festival. It was a Sunday in the latter half of October. There, she called out to the boys that piqued her interest enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">She realized that she was being called a molester, but didn't mind it too much. With so much alcohol in her system, she was unable to think rationally anyway. Instead, all those negative emotions like 'I'm sad' and 'I'm lonely' were amplified, filling her head instead…</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who called out to her in that state was the boy. A friend of her younger brother. The boy she had met countless times so far. All those times she had teased him because of his cute reactions. She never imagined that she would fall in love with him one day.</p>
<p class="null-p">After he found her, he heard her out in the student council office. At first, he scolded her angrily, saying things like "What are you doing?!" but after she had explained her circumstances, and how she had been dumped by her boyfriend, he became kind and understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the boy, that was probably nothing special. No, it was almost self- explanatory. Seeing someone hurt like her, he had just showed sympathy towards the hurt. That was all. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p class="null-p">But maybe it was because of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no hidden meaning or hidden intentions behind the boy's words. It was all out of pure goodwill, and the girl could feel that resonating within her chest. Even though she was drunk as all hell back then, she still clearly remembered how her heart had felt back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it because of her weakened heart? Was it because she was lonely after having lost a potential lover?</p>
<p class="null-p">That might have been the reason for it, and she was aware that she had the personality to quickly fall for someone. But the reason didn't matter at all. The boy's words and actions simply had warmed her cold heart. That was all the reason that Yuuhi needed to, once again, fall in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, she, Akiyama Asahi, might've been more nervous than ever before in her entire life.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a normal evening on a weekday, in the latter parts of November. Once her university classes ended, she had an appointment where she met someone to have a relaxed drink in a cafe, which they had entered a few minutes ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">The person she was here with was the boy who she had one-sided feelings for. He was three years younger than her, and even though he was nothing but a high school boy, Yuuhi, who should have been brimming with confidence because of all of her experience, was a nervous wreck. However, Keiki, who was still wearing his uniform, had no idea how tense Yuuhi was mentally, and he just calmly looked around the cafe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is what it looks like from the inside." "Some friends of mine work part-time here." "Really? It feels very peaceful here. I like it." "I'm glad that you like it here."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that with a calm tone, but her heart was beating like crazy. So much so that it actually started to hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why am I so nervous?</p>
<p class="null-p">Akiyama Yuuhi was a person who had loved many people before. She was experienced in the feeling of loving and being loved. Even so, just sitting together with a younger boy was making her feel like her heart was about to leap out of her chest. She would unconsciously fix her hair, or dismiss her own behaviour with thoughts like Am I some middle schooler who's in love for the first time? but none of that helped calm herself down. However, she had to act like the grown-up that she technically was, and she had to take the lead now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, what do you want to eat, Kei-chan? I really recommend the roll cake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll trust your recommendation." "Leave it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ringing the bell, a waitress came over to take their orders. Two of the recommended roll cake. As for the drinks, Yuuhi decided on some black tea, and Keiki ordered some coffee.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm, Kei-chan?" "Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-The weather is really nice today, isn't it?" "Eh? …Ah, yes, that's true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah yeah. It really is nice…"</p>
<p class="null-p">………</p>
<p class="null-p">……………</p>
<p class="null-p">…………………</p>
<p class="null-p">…What exactly should I talk to him about now that we're alone??!?!?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Emotions were exploding inside Yuuhi. Even though she was the one who invited him out, she hadn't planned this far ahead. She hadn't planned anything, as a matter of fact. And it wasn't like talking about the weather was a good ice breaker, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe I should've invited Shou-chan as well…</p>
<p class="null-p">Being suddenly alone with the boy she had feelings for was too much of a hurdle. Up until now, all the times she had met Keiki was with Shouma and Asahi, and back then, she didn't have any romantic feelings for him yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">To think that I'd suddenly get lost like this…</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, right now, the girl was helpless as to what she should do. Yuuhi-san, who should be able to boast because of her experience, was acting like a girl who was experiencing her first love, and she was even unable to say anything to the subject of her feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, is it legally okay for a twenty-year old like me to invite a minor out for tea?!</p>
<p class="null-p">* Yes, it's perfectly legal.</p>
<p class="null-p">As you can see, Yuuhi was clearly overwhelmed by the situation. So much so that even the person sitting across from her was starting to get worried about the university student.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuuhi-san, are you not feeling well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, I'm perfectly fine! Rather, I'm brimming with energy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? If you say so."</p>
<p class="null-p">She furiously waved her hands to assure the boy of her health. In response, the boy showed a worried smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kei-chan really is kind…</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like back at the culture festival, his never-ending kindness make Yuuhi's heart skip a beat. She was starting to feel all sweet inside, though she hadn't taken a bite from the cake yet. She became seriously happy just because of some consideration, which made the normal-looking boy in front of her look like a prince charming. Oh the magic of love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now you're laughing?! Are you really okay?!" "I'm totally A-Okay~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now Yuuhi couldn't stop grinning. A young maiden's heart can be extremely complicated, and yet so simple at times. At around the same time that Yuuhi regained her positivity, their order arrived. The roll cakes and drinks were lined up on the table, and the waitress commented with "Take your time~" and left them alone again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's eat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thanks for the food."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them picked up their forks, and put a piece of cake in their mouths. At the same time, their eyes started sparkling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, this roll cake is really delicious! It's so fluffy!" "Right! This fluffy feeling is the best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Humans feel happy when they eat something delicious. The awkwardness from before was gone without a trace, and thanks to the special-order cakes, the conversation was back on track.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm glad that Kei-chan is enjoying himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy was enjoying the cake that she had recommended. Yuuhi felt incredibly happy just from seeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But is it really fine for you to treat me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why do you ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wasn't really angry at you back at the culture festival, so there's no need to make up for it or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm… But I did bother you quite a bit after all, so just wanted to thank you for it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I have to repay your kindness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'm digging in." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she saw Keiki's smile, Yuuhi couldn't hold her own back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once their roll cakes had completely disappeared from their plates, the boy spoke up, as Yuuhi was putting down her tea cup.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I wanted to talk with Yuuhi-san." "You did?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-san is worried about you. She thinks that you're acting a bit weird." "Asahi-chan is…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi knew why. After awakening to a new love at the culture festival, Yuuhi had been constantly thinking about the boy day and night, every day, in and out. Asahi had seen this as a reason to be worried about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that you started acting weird after the culture festival, so I thought that maybe you had a broken heart still. So I thought that I would hear you</p>
<p class="null-p">out if you needed someone to talk to." "Kei-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was probably the reason why he had accepted Yuuhi's invitation to tea. After hearing about it from Asahi, he was worried that she was still hurt from being dumped, and wanted to cheer her up as best as he could.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You really are kind." "? Yuuhi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She could feel her chest burning up, and her gaze was glued on Keiki. She wanted to tell him immediately how she felt. That she had continued to harbour these feelings for him ever since the culture festival.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">If she didn't confess here, she would probably spend the rest of her days just like before. Gloomy, and in uncertainty. And that-was what she would never allow to happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm, Kei-chan?" "Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're fine with it… would you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Become my boyfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's all she had to say. And if he accepted, she could openly show these feelings towards him, and love him and be loved however much she wanted. She would hug him, and even spoil him. She would do anything for him if they became a couple. But even so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you help give me some love advice?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she realized it, she had blurted out those words. It was the worst possible way for an experienced woman like her to run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, on the second floor of the Akiyama household, in the room of the eldest daughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! You fell in love with Kei-kun, Yuuhi-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing the details from Yuuhi, Asahi couldn't hide her surprise. "Hey, you're too loud!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry… I just…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had wondered what Yuuhi's sudden visit was about, but she didn't expect her to just say "I like Kei-chan" like it was nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you were acting so weird, Yuuhi-chan?" "Yeah… I was lovesick…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lovesickness, huh? That explains why you were spacing out all the time." The mystery was solved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, just come in and have a seat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, will do," said Yuuhi as she sat down on the bed. Getting up from her chair, Asahi sat down next to her. "So when did you first develop feelings for Kei-kun?" "Since that culture festival at Shou-chan's school." "Ahhh, I thought so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi wasn't present, but she had heard that their father went to take the drunken Yuuhi home with his car on that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was plagued with a broken heart, and Kei-chan was so kind to me…" "Oho, and that's why you fell in love with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi just nodded in agreement to Asahi's assumptions. When she saw that overly cute reaction from her little sister, Asahi just wanted to cuddle Yuuhi, but since this wasn't the time nor the place for it, she held back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I wanted to ask Asahi-chan for some advice…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't particularly mind, but… that's pretty rare. Normally, if you found a new love, you'd be the one going on the attack without a second thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but just this once I can't do that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Meaning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-chan is different from all the boys I've dated before." "Well, he is a weird fellow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think he'd just accept if I asked him to accompany me to a hotel." "I think that any normal person would decline that kind of offer."</p>
<p class="null-p">Anybody would be a bit confused if so many steps were skipped that quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hugged him in my drunkness at the culture festival, but he didn't have much of a reaction."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you did something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that he'd definitely give in if I pushed my breasts against him, but seducing Kei-chan is pretty tough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… There are boys who dislike it if you're too proactive." "Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I always feel troubled if boys are getting too aggressive with me." "T-Then Kei-chan is the same?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably." "No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I wouldn't mind it if Shou-kun were aggressive towards me." "I don't think that will ever happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their younger brother was a lolicon, after all, so there would be no way he'd be attracted to his older sister of all people. That was also one of the things that made him so cute, but right now, the talk about Asahi's little sister was</p>
<p class="null-p">more important.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about we ask Shou-kun for advice?" "Shou-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He knows Kei-kun pretty well, I'd imagine, so his advice might even be worth its weight in gold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shou-chan lacks delicacy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like to be the one to take Shou-kun's side, but just this once, I can't."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, he had just made his super-cute girlfriend cry. It was obvious that he wasn't the kind of person who could be Yuuhi's cupid.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if you're not gonna ask Shou-kun, it'll be hard to create a common ground with Kei-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but… The thing is, today, I asked Kei-chan out for some tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I said that it was to repay him for what he did during the culture festival. I was trying to confess, but I couldn't… And then I said something completely different…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I asked him for love advice…" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Asahi was lost as to how to comment on that, and her eyes opened</p>
<p class="null-p">wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You asked him to give you love advice?" "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You asked that from the person you like?" "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After verifying it once more, Asahi looked up at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now you've really done it. That makes it sound like you have a one-sided crush on a completely different guy, and Kei-kun is totally the kind of guy who'd get the wrong idea after hearing something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Yuuhi knew that she had messed up. That made it even more difficult to confess to Keiki now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But he did agree to it, right?" "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then isn't that actually not all that bad?" "It isn't?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since he's offered to help out, you have an actual reason to meet with him, don't you? So you've just gotta talk to him lots and lots and get closer to him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Light returned to Yuuhi's teary eyes. She then tightly hugged her older sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-chan… I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aye, aye. I love you too, Yuuhi-chan… But let go of me now, please. I can't breathe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Patting her little sister on the head, Asahi pondered this development.</p>
<p class="null-p">…To think that I would have to help out Yuuhi-chan in terms of love…</p>
<p class="null-p">She was surprised because a situation like this had never happened before. In terms of love, Yuuhi would always rush ahead recklessly, and Asahi mostly just watched her from the shadows.</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't help but think that this whole situation was extremely rare.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe that just shows how serious she is this time?</p>
<p class="null-p">The other person was their younger brother's friend, after all, so Asahi would be relieved if Yuuhi found herself a reliable boyfriend. As her older sister, she was ready to support her with everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After having finished her bath the following evening, Yuuhi went back to her room and sat down on her bed, resting her back against the wall as she held her phone in her hands. On the other end of the call was the boy whom she had feelings for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to call you at this hour. Did I bother you?" "It's fine. This is about the love advice, right?" "Yeah, exactly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since they were a high school student and a university student, their schedules didn't quite line up. Having a smartphone really was handy. It was able to connect you to almost anyone at any time. Using the love advice as an excuse, her initial failure had actually turned into a blessing in disguise, enabling Yuuhi to always have a reason for contacting Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, are you really fine with asking me about this? I don't mean to brag, but I don't have any experience in love whatsoever, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's perfectly fine. Just talking to you like this will definitely help me out, Kei-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Help you out? In what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like as an example. The boy is about the same age as you." Rather, she was currently talking to that very boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so he's younger than you. What kind of person is he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's the rather passive type…" "Ohh, a docile type. I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess it'd be more honest to say that it feels like he doesn't have any interest in girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Boys like that exist?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They might exist, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm talking about you, you know? She wanted to tell him, but she kept those feelings locked away in her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Keiki had plenty of interest in girls. To be precise, he was constantly wishing for a girlfriend. But he had decided that he would give his virginity to the girl he loved. As a result, he might seem a bit old-school in when compared to most of today's youth. He did, though, love thinking about breasts, like any healthy boy would.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, anyway. Although I have a lot of experience, it's my first time having feelings for a boy younger than me, so I wanted to hear your opinion, since you're a high school student in the same age range as him. Asking Shou-chan wouldn't do much good, I don't think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, he's a lolicon, so his advice probably wouldn't help you much. I understand. Ask me anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She wouldn't get a chance like this too often. It was time to find out about Keiki's taste in women.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, first question. What do you think about my breasts?" "Your breasts?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm pretty confident in them, but maybe they should be a bit bigger?" "N-No, I think that they're fine the way they are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?! Do you want to cop a feel?!" "What are you asking me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, what are you imagining? Kei-chan, you pervert~" "I don't want to be told that by Yuuhi-san of all people!" "Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she couldn't see him, she could imagine his red face right now. After that, Yuuhi asked him several other questions. What his favorite food was, his favorite genres, his favorite color of clothes, and so on.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard these questions, Keiki would laugh, be a bit surprised, or panic a bit if it involved something perverted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Question 8: Would you date an older woman?" "Of course I would."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? You're not suddenly gonna tell me that you like grade school girls?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a lolicon, so sure, I don't mind older women."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… So it's possible…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi couldn't help but grin. She felt happy, knowing that there was a chance for her. But…</p>
<p class="null-p">…Just hearing his voice like this isn't enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had fun talking to him on the phone like this, and she was happy. But it still felt lacking. She wanted to see him, touch him, and feel his warmth. That was probably why…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I want to go on a date." "A date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She blurted out those words before she could stop herself. Realizing that her tongue had slipped, her head started burning up, and she quickly tried to correct herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No! It's just that I've never really gone on a date aside from at a hotel! That's why I was interested in a real date!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a crazy coming-out if I've ever heard one."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Yuuhi felt like she hadn't exactly fixed everything, it still sounded better than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a short pause while Keiki seemed to be thinking about something, and then…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then should we go on a practice date next weekend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd have to be me and not him, but I'd be glad to help you gain some experience for the real deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did promise to help you out as much as I could, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-chan… Thank you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't matter if it was just practice in his eyes. For Yuuhi, it was a real date. Her first date with the boy she loved.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the next school-free day, Yuuhi was waiting in front of a big monument near the train station for the boy to arrive. The time was around 9am in the morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe I dressed up a bit too much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing her usual long skirt and cardigan, and her long hair was styled naturally as well. While she held a small mirror in her hand and played with her bangs, the boy arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was wearing deep blue slacks, as well as knitted garments and a shirt. He wasn't wearing his uniform today. Keiki spotted Yuuhi, and he waved at her as he walked over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Yuuhi-san. You're pretty early."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning. I would've felt bad making you wait after asking you come with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, you look really pretty today. Your clothes really suit you, Yuuhi-san." "T-Thank you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just by being praised like that made Yuuhi feel like she was ascending to heaven. Still, since he was usually the passive type, these playboy comments from Keiki really toyed with Yuuhi's heart. Although Keiki ultimately lacked in romantic experience, he gained a lot of it back by just going on dates with</p>
<p class="null-p">girls. That was why praising a girl for her looks was already something completely natural for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's go." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus their date started. Since Yuuhi wished for a normal date, they would follow the standard date routine.</p>
<p class="null-p">First, they watched an animal movie together. "That was pretty interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that the perpetrator was the pet dog." After that they played air hockey at the game center. "Will you please cheer up already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph. I didn't know that you were such a teaser, Kei-chan." "Weren't you the one who said that we'd go all out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they performed a duet inside a karaoke box.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-chan is pretty good at singing, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I think that you're much better than me, Yuuhi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I come here often with my friends, after all. I tried to invite Asahi-chan a few times, but she would never join in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, Asahi-san is tone deaf, isn't she?" "…Hey, Kei-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm actually wearing some risky black underwear right now." "Why did you suddenly tell me about that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? It's practice for seducing a boy younger than me." "You don't have to practice that."</p>
<p class="null-p">She'd even tease him like that from time to time. Yuuhi couldn't be happier. She was able to converse with him in person like this, and not over the phone. It was a date with the person she loved. There couldn't be any greater joy in life.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time of day changed to afternoon, and after they finished eating lunch at a nearby family restaurant, they went to walk around a nearby park, which was pretty big.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're in the calligraphy club right, Kei-chan? Do you do calligraphy?" "I'm a member, yes, but I don't practice calligraphy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But there's this crazy good calligrapher named Sayuki-senpai in there. She's been practicing her calligraphy since she was young, and she's even won a prize in a contest before, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… So she's a girl, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah yeah-Uh, Yuuhi-san? Why are you pouting like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here's a question for Kei-chan. What do you think about talking about other girls during a date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's a no-go… I'm sorry." "Very well! Keep that in mind!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, instructor! I'll engrave it in my heart!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" "…Pft."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haha."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that short exchange, they both looked at each other and laughed. It was a comfortable atmosphere, like a real boyfriend-girlfriend couple. But then, a drastic change arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, Kiryuu-kun?" "Mifuyu-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A kimono-wearing woman came walking towards them and called out to Keiki. At first glance, she seemed to be a high school student. She looked like quite the beauty even from Yuuhi's point of view, with her long, glossy hair falling down her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is she a friend of Kei-chan…?</p>
<p class="null-p">But what kind of relationship did they have?</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yuuhi looked on, the other two started chatting. "What a coincidence to meet you here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, me? I was out to buy new panties." "Umm, I didn't ask, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you wanna see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't, so please stop trying to show me that bag."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was about to open the bag to show Keiki its contents, but he desperately declined her offer. Yuuhi couldn't wait any longer. She tugged on his clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm, Kei-chan, who is that girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm sorry. This is Tokihara Mifuyu-san. She's the mother of Sayuki- senpai, who I was just telling you about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! She's her mother?! She's so young!" "Ara, thank you. I appreciate the flattery."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In Mifuyu-san's case, it's not even real flattery, though. Anyway, this is Akiyama Yuuhi-san. She's my friend's older sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi bowed down ever so slightly when Keiki introduced her. "I'm Akiyama Yuuhi. Nice to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, so you are Akiyama-kun's older sister. I heard about Akiyama-kun from Sayuki-chan. You seem to be really fond of your lolicon younger brother, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahah, that's mostly correct."</p>
<p class="null-p">There probably weren't any better words to describe Shouma. It really was a mystery how he had ended up as a lolicon, seeing how he had such a wonderful older sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why are the two of you together like this, Kiryuu-kun?" "Ahh, that's-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mifuyu posed a perfectly reasonable question. But when Keiki went to answer, Mifuyu reacted even before him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! Are you cheating?! You're cheating, even though you already have</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki-chan, Kiryuu-kun?!" "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were just playing with Sayuki-chan?! Is that it?!" "Hold on, what are you talking about, Mifuyu-san?!" "…Kei-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"See, Yuuhi-san got the wrong idea now because of you! There's gotta be limits to how far you can take a joke!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki earnestly scolded her, Mifuyu pouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, it was just a little joke. There's no need to get so angry at me~" "I believed Kei-chan from the get-go though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what was that cold gaze of yours about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking rationally about it, there was no way that a passive boy like Keiki would do something like that, but she regretted that she had doubted him for a second.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Sayuki-senpai and I aren't in that sort of relationship." "You can just marry into our family, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Acting fulfilled now that she had teased her daughter's Kouhai, Mifuyu's gaze now turned towards Yuuhi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Yuuhi-san? There's one thing I'd like to ask." "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of panties are you wearing right now? Could you show me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she mishear?</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi was fairly certain that she had just heard a 'Show me your panties' in there…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a bit! Just a peek is fine, so please show me your panties!" "Ehhhhhhhhh?!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">She didn't mishear her after all. "Gehehe, come here, come here~" "Please don't come any closer!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a vulgar laugh, the woman approached Yuuhi and stretched out her hands. Unable to stand back and watch, Keiki stepped in between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's keep it at that! Mifuyu-san, don't sexually harass Yuuhi-san like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? But of course I'd be interested in what kind of panties she's wearing. It's not that often that I have such a cute girl in front of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's only you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi didn't have any way of knowing, but Mifuyu actually was very attracted towards all kinds of panties, and she had quite the collection at home. She was truly a pervert with an expensive hobby.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, you reek of alcohol?! Were you drinking before now, Mifuyu-san?!" "Exactly~! I was actually out with friends drinking all day up until now~!" "No wonder you're so energetic…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I was like that back at the culture festival, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi realized that she might've troubled Keiki and the others even more than she had previously thought. In truth, she had really been going around, trying to seduce other boys. Because of these thoughts, Akiyama Yuuhi's attention was completely diverted away from Mifuyu, who was still trying to reveal Yuuhi's panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-An opening!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! Yuuhi-san, watch out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Using the opening, Mifuyu quickly closed the distance between her and Yuuhi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, now what kind of panties are you wearing, Yuuhi-chan?" With both hands, she tightly grasped Yuuhi's skirt and flipped it up. "…Fueh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to comprehend what just happened, Yuuhi let out a baffled sound. And having caught a glimpse of what was beneath her skirt, Keiki was confused as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"White…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, not the black panties that she had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who could blame Keiki for his confusion? A while ago, she had stated that she was wearing erotic black panties. Even so, the ones she was wearing right now were a pair of pure white panties. When he noticed this contradiction,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuuhi-san, are you…?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the boy threw her a dubious look, cold sweat started running down Yuuhi's cheek. There was no way for her to run away now.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I'm still a virgin."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside a small park, Yuuhi confessed to Keiki as she sat on a bench. "That whole thing about me boasting about my experience was all a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both about the panties, and about her being an experienced Onee-san. It was all a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Mifuyu had calmed down a bit shortly after flipping Yuuhi's skirt, and had gone home after apologizing to Yuuhi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki, who was sitting next to Yuuhi, reluctantly spoke up. "Umm, why would you lie about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back in middle school, the girls from my class said that not having any experience in that sort of thing up until then was really strange. I felt really embarrassed back then that I hadn't had any experience yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I can sort of understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling left behind by the people around you could be pretty embarrassing for most people. Keiki knew what that felt like.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So back then I happened to say that I had my first experience back in grade school…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's pretty crazy, even if you were pressured into it…" "I'm reflecting on it. And I regret it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So since then, you've continued to say that." "Yeah, I never managed to clear it up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After one lie, in order to protect your dignity, more and more lies had to be made. Before she realized it, she had already become a university student.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do Asahi-san and Shouma know about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shou-chan doesn't, but Asahi-chan does. She just plays along in front of everyone else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had even gone around calling herself a bitch. She said that she'd gone out with countless men before. That she liked it rough. And Shouma believed all of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's true that I fall for other men easily when they treat me kindly. Well, it's not like I could get a boyfriend that easy anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I can't imagine you having that much trouble with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, because I keep boasting about my experience, everybody at my university just thinks that I'm a total slut now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because of that, most of the boys I get close with only see me in that kind of light. I always play along, saying things like 'Want to touch my breasts?' or 'Wanna go to a hotel?' and so on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what are you up against, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being only able to say "Wanna go to a hotel?" to the person she has feelings for would be nothing short of torture. No wonder the person she confessed to wouldn't be a big fan of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? So what about the part where you said you got dumped by your boyfriend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that was the truth. That guy was from the same university as me, and he still hadn't heard about the rumours. So when he said that he fell for me at first sight, I happily accepted his confession."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oho, and then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He asked me where I wanted to go for our date that day, and I just happened to blurt out the hotel line again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could almost see that scene happening in front of him. She had</p>
<p class="null-p">mentioned that she invited him to a hotel on the first day they started dating, so that must be the truth. The boy had probably thought that she was a pure girl, since he didn't know about the rumours going around. When she invited him like that, the shock must've been too great, and he dumped her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though I finally managed to get a boyfriend, I ruined it on the first day, and got dumped… Right now, I'd be fine no matter what boy it was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why she had invaded the culture festival, trying to seduce a boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, rather than brimming with experience, you're a total beginner at love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's exactly it. I'm sorry for acting all high and mighty with Mao-chan before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the references back then didn't help, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were talking about the time when Mao was in a slump. So when she said that she had her first time in grade school, that was all a lie, even though she had said that with a completely red face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm really jealous of Asahi-chan. Unlike me, who is always treated like a bitch, she's been constantly aiming for Shou-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not really a good thing, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">Admiring a full-fledged brocon wasn't exactly the way to go, either. "Maybe I'll never be able to experience love with anyone…" "Yuuhi-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought that they were pretty similar.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been targeted by perverts all the time, and was unable to get a real lover, while everyone thought that Yuuhi was a bitch, and she had no other choice but to act that way. Their circumstances might be different, but they were unable to find love because of their surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you just trying to keep up appearances too much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whether or not you have experience or not, Yuuhi-san is Yuuhi-san. And I think that you're cute either way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Funya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki honestly spoke his feelings, Yuuhi let out a weird voice and her face flushed bright red. She couldn't help but stare at him, even if he realized how flustered she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I think you really should take responsibility, Kei-chan." "What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like for the sin of making a university girl like Yuuhi blush like this without</p>
<p class="null-p">realizing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, from my point of view, any man would fall sooner or later if you went on the offensive. Even the person you currently have feelings for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can guarantee it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see. Then you'd better be prepared."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't immediately understand the meaning behind her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The clock in her room pointed at 9 hours and 10 minutes into the evening.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi had finished her evening bath, and was now sitting on her bed, reminiscing about today's date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-chan was really kind today, as well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt like she had fallen in love with him even more because of today. She felt an intense rush of happiness when she thought about all the things he had said and done for her today. And while she was flapping her legs up and down, a knock came from the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuuhi-chan, are you still awake?" "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I come in?" "Sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">The door opened and Asahi poked her face in. Just as always, she was</p>
<p class="null-p">wearing cargo pants and a shirt, since she wasn't the kind of person to wear skirts. Yuuhi made some room for Asahi, and Asahi sat down beside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen to this, Yuuhi-chan." "What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shou-kun got mad at me because I tried to enter the bath with him when he was using it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it seems like he doesn't need you anymore, Asahi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He got a cute girlfriend now, after all. So I thought that I had to be as lovey- dovey with him as possible before they marry and he leaves the house."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan isn't going to marry into our house?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder. As his Onee-chan, I really wish that she'd come here. Then again, Koharu-chan is the daughter of a company president."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever future was ahead of them, both seemed to be enjoyable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. How are things on your end, Yuuhi-chan? How was your</p>
<p class="null-p">date with Kei-kun?" "It was really fun." "I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard that, Asahi felt happy. "But there's a problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to be with Kei-chan even more now." "Wow…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Yuuhi's confession, even Asahi felt a bit flustered. "Asahi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to confess to Kei-chan." "I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope that it works out." "Thanks, I'll try my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he had found out about her being a virgin, and had lied about all her experience, there was nothing to hide anymore. She could honestly tell him that her feelings were directed only at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">On an evening near the beginning of the week, Yuuhi called Keiki out to the cafe again in order to confess. Naturally, she couldn't exactly call him and say "I'm going to confess, okay?", so she instead covered it up by saying that</p>
<p class="null-p">she needed some more love advice. Just like before, Keiki was wearing his school uniform and sitting across from Yuuhi. Since the store was fairly empty, their order arrived pretty quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi had black tea again, and Keiki had ordered coffee, but they didn't order any cake today. After putting milk and sugar into her tea, she stirred the tea around with her spoon while looking at Keiki. He took a sip of his coffee at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?" "No, it's nothing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as their gazes met, Yuuhi awkwardly averted her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Uuuu… Just thinking that I'll confess soon makes me feel really nervous…</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of her nervousness, she kept stirring with the spoon. "Ummm… I think that the sugar should be dissolved now?" "Ah, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did you want to talk about today?" "Ah, right, the advice…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Learning from her previous mistake, Yuuhi had thought of a foolproof plan today.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't think about anything unnecessary, and just focus on saying that confession!</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi decided to ignore the guilt of luring Keiki here under false pretenses. Hence…</p>
<p class="null-p">Here we go!</p>
<p class="null-p">To get her younger boyfriend, Yuuhi leaned her body forward- "A-Actually, about that person I like-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Isn't that Keiki-senpai over there?" "Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeei-chaaaaaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprised by the sudden interruption, Yuuhi's voice slipped as she screamed out 'Kei-chan' in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">Come on, what kind of timing is this!</p>
<p class="null-p">Searching for the perpetrator who had interrupted her confession, Yuuhi spotted a group of four girls that just entered the store.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you're right. I didn't notice at all." "Nii-san is with a woman…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Isn't that Akiyama's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A blonde-haired, small-statured girl, and a big-breasted girl with long black hair. A docile looking girl with shoulder-long hair, and a tsundere-looking girl with a side-tail.</p>
<p class="null-p">The four of them moved closer to Yuuhi's and Keiki's table as a group.</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of group is this?! And they're all really cute!</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi even was familiar with one of them. "Ah, Yuuhi-san, it's been a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-chan, I haven't seen you since that question of yours." "Huh? Mao-senpai, is that an acquaintance of yours?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, this is the first time you've met her, isn't it, Yuika? This is Yuuhi-</p>
<p class="null-p">san, Akiyama's oldest sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, Akiyama-senpai's older sister, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The blonde-haired girl nodded in a satisfied manner. So this girl was Yuika. "Since you're Akiyama-kun's older sister, you must be the shotacon, right?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next was a big-breasted girl, who said what could've been an insult to Yuuhi even though they had just met. When Yuuhi saw that glittering black hair and pure white skin… Something connected in her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You must be Sayuki-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi reflexively pulled down her skirt when she was reminded about what Sayuki's mother, Mifuyu, had done to her. Following Sayuki, Mizuha made a slight bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice to meet you. I am Nii-san's non-blood-related little sister, Mizuha." "Hello… Non-blood-related?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, that one line was weirdly emphasized, but that might've just been Yuuhi's imagination. Also, Mizuha's gaze towards her was weirdly cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why is she so wary of me?</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi had no recollection of having done anything to ruin their mood, not to mention that this was their first meeting. But she didn't have much time to think about it, as Keiki quickly spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry about this, Yuuhi-san. I told everyone about the roll cake here, but I didn't think that they'd all stop by today as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">What a horrendous coincidence to occur on the very day she had planned to confess. And the appearance of unwanted guests didn't quite end here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, isn't that Kei-kun-senpai and the cuties from the calligraphy club?" "What a coincidence. Also, Mitani, shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun really is Ayano-san's destined person." "What a crowd."</p>
<p class="null-p">Another group of girls came in, wearing the same uniform as the other girls. One of them had the looks of a girl, but was actually a boy. There was also a girl with beige twintails. Another had one eye hidden by her bangs, and there was one with wavy hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">There are more and more girls…?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Even worse, they all seemed to know Keiki as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The calligraphy club is having a tea party? We were planning on having a girls' party."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though there's a man mixed in there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl with the wavy hair started talking to Keiki, and the other girl with the eye hidden by her bangs came over to Yuuhi. Just when Yuuhi was wondering what she was planning to do, she started sniffing her a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't smell like alcohol today," she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't drink anything today, after all. Also, I'm sorry for causing so much trouble during the culture festival. Right, Ayano-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?! So you're the molester from back then?!" "Please don't call me a molester!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy that had the looks of a girl called out to her with the worst possible</p>
<p class="null-p">nickname. And just like this, the interior of the shop suddenly became really lively.</p>
<p class="null-p">A heated discussion, involving both the student council and the calligraphy club, began as to who would drink tea with Keiki. The waitress for her part just stood in the corner of the room, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">This clearly isn't the atmosphere to confess anymore…</p>
<p class="null-p">The confession plan ended in failure because of the sudden interruption. Drinking the tea that had cooled down considerably by now, Yuuhi stood up, said "I'm going to the toilet real quick," and walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After separating a bit from everyone, she turned around and looked at the gathering of girls around Keiki. The boy she liked was trying to calm everyone down. Just seeing that, her chest felt hot, and a happy feeling filled her. But, even so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Yuuhi realized what the problem was.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't want to see it. She didn't want to know about it. That one, cruel reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see how it is, Kei-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't cry, because she quickly accepted it. The moment she saw that scene, she gave up immediately. Akiyama Yuuhi's love would not be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuuhi arrived home, she entered the living room. Asahi, who was currently making some coffee in the kitchen, lifted her head when she entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome back, Yuuhi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm back, Asahi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">They exchanged their usual 'Welcome back' and I'm back.' "Do you want some coffee too, Yuuhi-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi sat down on the couch after asking for some coffee, and it didn't take long for Asahi to arrive with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go." "Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">After accepting the mug, Yuuhi started blowing on the hot coffee, and then carefully took a sip. It was the flavour that Yuuhi liked the most, with lots of milk and sugar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Smiling happily, Asahi picked up her own mug and sat down next to Yuuhi. "Mother and father will be home late today as well, so we should eat what we have. Shou-kun is still out with the tennis club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi wondered if she was smiling like she was trying to. But it didn't take long for her to find out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuuhi-chan, did something happen?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels like you're forcing yourself to smile." "…That's Asahi-chan for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was nothing she could hide from her sister. Normally, she was thankful that her sister could immediately tell whenever something was wrong, but just this once, it was a bit troublesome.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I failed you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so you failed… Wait, ehhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-chan, you don't have to be so shocked or anything." "Well, of course I'd be surprised…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi did say that she was going to confess, but Asahi didn't expect that she would try to do so that quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, he rejected you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I couldn't even confess to him." "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was unsure how to tell Asahi, Yuuhi just spilled the beans completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-chan has a girl he likes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really? Well, he has a lot of female friends, but he's not going out with any of them, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, yeah. I think that Kei-chan himself doesn't realize it yet." "Doesn't that mean that you still have a chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… But I knew at first glance."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi remembered back to the scene she saw.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I'd understand. I like him after all. But those kind eyes of his aren't for me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuuhi-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And it seems like the girl is also in love with Kei-chan." "Ahh, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If you left them alone, things would develop naturally. It would turn into a relationship that would make everyone else say "Just explode, you damned normies" and "Get married already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just plan on telling Kei-chan that I confessed, but got rejected in the end. That way, he won't have to help me with my fictional love advice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Yuuhi was done talking, Asahi had a saddened expression on her face as she spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you once again ended up with a broken heart…" "Don't say it so quickly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, it's the truth after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">You teaser! …I decided! I'll go drink something today!" "That's fine, but hold back a bit, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll reset myself with some alcohol, and search for a new love! I'll find someone who's even more kind and reliable than Kei-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good luck with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I mean, if I don't do that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If she weren't able to get over him soon, those cold feelings wouldn't stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi knew that very well, after having been rejected so many times already. "Yuuhi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Hya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she heard her name called, Yuuhi found herself being tightly embraced by Asahi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Asahi-chan…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to hold back, okay? You always have me." "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tears finally started building up in Yuuhi's eyes. Since she was twenty already, she shouldn't be crying like a small child, but her 'Onee-chan' was willing to spoil her just this once.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuuhi had been crying into Asahi's chest for a little while, she spoke up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Asahi-chan." "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll stop telling lies now." "…Yeah, that's good."</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, a de-bitchification. She planned on being open about being inexperienced, and she would find people who accepted her like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Yuuhi-chan. You're really cute, after all. You'll find your destined one soon enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-chan, you're saying the same things that Kei-chan said to me back at the culture festival."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Asahi let out a flustered "Ahaha" laugh, which made Yuuhi smile as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, who is the girl that Kei-kun has feelings for now? Is it someone I know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After thinking shortly… "…It's a secret."</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting her index finger on her lips, Yuuhi answered with a grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who exactly was the boring prince looking at? She would keep that a secret for a little longer.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a certain day, with only a few days left in November.</p>
<p class="null-p">The location was the 4th floor of a flat, in a room inside the Nanjou household. After stuffing her belongings into a suitcase, Mao wiped the sweat away from her forehead with a "Phew~".</p>
<p class="null-p">"…All right, preparations are complete!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Quite some time had passed since she had started packing her things, and the time was close to 9pm in the evening now. Tomorrow, the school trip would start, hence the preparations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"School trip… Normally, I'd be bummed out, but it's a good chance to get closer to Kiryuu. If I'm not careful, he might just be taken away by some other girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The incident where Keiki and Takasaki Shiho had been in a dubious relationship was still fresh in her memory. Although she knew that it was all a lie because of a stalker who had been plaguing Shiho, they might've actually started dating if things went south. Seeing it like that, Mao decided that it was time to act. After all, Keiki might not be aware of it, but he was actually pretty popular. The number of rivals in love for Mao was constantly growing, after all. There was no doubt that in the near future, Keiki would eventually start going out with someone from the calligraphy club, or even the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But during school trip the prez and Yuika won't be able to obstruct us."</p>
<p class="null-p">In this event, only the second-years would be participating. Hence, the only rivals she had this time around were Mizuha and Ayano. Since Mao always</p>
<p class="null-p">had to pay attention to a lot of love rivals, she naturally would jump at a chance like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll definitely show that dense idiot this time around!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Nanjou Mao was preparing both her heart and her luggage for the trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Mizuha was preparing in the Kiryuu household. Mizuha mumbled to herself while stuffing a change of clothes and her daily necessities into her bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… Recently, nothing has really happened between me and Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing worth mentioning would be the time when she approached him while wearing a school swimsuit during his bath. She really had tried her best, but it wasn't enough to sway her older brother's heart. Just as promised, she was holding back on the kissing, and she was even wearing panties to school, even if that caused her stress to accumulate (although she made do with underwear that was a bit more erotic). This all meant that Mizuha was currently hungry for affection from her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I want to hug Nii-san. I want him to hug me. I want him to pat me on the head. I want him to kiss me… And if possible, even past that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to be connected to the member of the opposite sex whom she loved. That was something that every human wished for, and nothing to be embarrassed about.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was how she could achieve that final result. Right now, living together with this person under the same roof was almost torture for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'd hate Nii-san if he was the kind of pervert who would constantly attack me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted him to only look at her. She didn't want him to ogle other girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a final item that Mizuha hadn't stuffed into her bag yet. It was a small vinyl package that contained a condom. Her gaze was serious as she gazed down at it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"J-Just to make sure! I don't think I'll need it, knowing Nii-san, but you never know what crazy things might happen! I have to be prepared!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not knowing who she was making excuses to, she quickly stuffed the item into her bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Also at the exact same time, inside the bathroom of the Fujimoto household, Ayano let out a sigh as she soaked her body in the bathwater.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From tomorrow on, it's the school trip…"</p>
<p class="null-p">All she could think about was that upcoming event.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, she already finished packing her things. She had gone over the list of necessary items and had finished her final check, making sure that nothing was missing.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_08_15.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The only thing that still made her feel anxious was that nothing had happened with that one boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to tell Kiryuu-kun during the trip…"</p>
<p class="null-p">During that trip, Ayano had something very important to talk about with that boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There's no more time."</p>
<p class="null-p">The closing in of the time limit made the vice president panic. She would have wished to tell him much sooner, but she had never really found the chance, and had constantly pushed it back. But now she had arrived at the deadline.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to hurry… and tell him…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she thought about the time she had left, she knew that this might be her final chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I need Kiryuu-kun no matter what…</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou Mao, Kiryuu Mizuha, and Fujimoto Ayano. All of them held romantic feelings for the same boy. The curtains were raised on their fateful school trip.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">* There will be spoilers from here onward, so please read the main volume first.</p>
<p class="null-p">I've made you wait. This has been the 8th installment of 'Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?'</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, the cover is decorated by a picture of the student council president. Concerning her fetish, I hope that you all enjoyed the reveal. Though her perversion might feel like it's going in a different direction, it still is revealed that has has a fetish like every other student council member. The vice president's smell fetish, the crossdresser, and the yuri author, we now even have NTR… I know I said it in the beginning, but this story really is full of perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">After having found out about Takasaki-senpai's fetish, I hope that you're looking forward to how she's going to be integrated into the story from now on.</p>
<p class="null-p">As you might have seen, this 8th installment was actually sold with small crystal figures for the special edition. The contents are exactly the same, but the cover is a special version drawn by the wonderful sune-sensei as well, which shows the four cute girls from the calligraphy club, once again all in swimsuits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh right, the manga has already made it to the 3rd volume. Over there, we're already past the reveal of Koharu-senpai and Ayano-san, and I'd be delighted if you looked forward to that as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, in the electronic magazine 'Harem', we will have yet another comicalization drawn by kanbe-sensei, something of a spin-off, called</p>
<p class="null-p">'Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka? Abnormal Harem', so please look forward to that as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a final thanks from me, I want to thank everyone who is involved in the production of the Hensuki anime. I couldn't be happier than I am currently, seeing all my favorite characters moving on the screen like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had planned to keep the original series to around ten volumes, but I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't fired up after seeing the anime, so please look forward to future developments.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, let's hope that we see each other in the next volume again. Hanama Tomo</p>
