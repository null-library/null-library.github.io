<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, is it fine if I call you Ootori-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I am Ootori. Ootori Koharu," Said the girl, sitting on a chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hood she had been wearing a few minutes before was gone and her long silver hair was gently hanging down in front of her reserved breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's really tiny, but a cute one nonetheless…</p>
<p class="null-p">The beauty in front of him really didn't look like a highschool student.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, she looked like a small, adorable rabbit.</p>
<p class="null-p">And right now, Koharu and Keiki were inside a fast food restaurant near school grounds. On the table where they were seated were fries and oolong tea for the girl, and a cup of coffee for Keiki. Their first meeting occurred around 30 minutes prior to this, so it had gotten pretty dark already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why did we come to a restaurant? The clubroom would have sufficed if we just wanted to talk," Ootori said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I feel like my soul would receive some serious damage if we stayed there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the clubroom, everywhere he looked, he could only see Akiyama</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma's face. The walls were one thing, but even the ceiling was staring back at him. If he'd stayed there any longer, he surely would have gone insane.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the girl in front of him looked really lovable at first glance, she was in fact a hardcore stalker that stalked Keiki's trusted friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaah… Why do these perverts have to keep appearing around me…?" The Senpai he had looked up to is a masochist.</p>
<p class="null-p">His cute Kouhai is a witch-like sadist.</p>
<p class="null-p">His close female classmate is a hardcore fujoshi.</p>
<p class="null-p">And finally, there's Ootori Koharu, who's another kind of pervert; a stalker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it wasn't Ootori-san either… Who is Cinderella…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cinderella?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. I was just talking to myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki was looking for a Cinderella who had dropped her panties. This girl who wholeheartedly devoted her days to stalking probably didn't have anything to do with that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Earlier that day after class, after Keiki had found out that his classmate Nanjou Mao was actually a fujoshi, he found an envelope inside his shoe locker. Inside this envelope, along with a very dangerous photo, there was a message telling him to come to the astronomy club room. Doing as he was told, he met with Koharu and learned of her stalker activities.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, why exactly did you call me to the club room, Ootori-san? You said something about a request back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Keiki's question, the girl stopped eating her fries and sat up straight in her chair. And then, her expression turned serious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have unrequited feelings for Akiyama-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I already know that….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I want Kiryuu to become my cupid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cupid… So basically someone to hook you and Shouma up, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I came to the conclusion that Kiryuu-kun and Akiyama-kun are pretty close.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, I still have this," She took out her smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was shown on the screen was a single photo. It was the same one that Keiki had found inside the envelope in his shoe locker, and it showed the moment when he had plunged his arm into the breasts of Tokihara Sayuki. She had her hair in a ponytail, her body barely covered by a revealing maid outfit, her hands restrained with handcuffs, and her neck securely fastened in a dog collar. To anyone who didn't know any better, this photo would look like pure sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun is actually pretty bold, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong! …Or rather, how did you even take that photo?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the astronomy clubroom, of course. I get a perfect view of that room when I look out of the window there, so it was really easy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not good to take non-consensual photos, you know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how far you've gone as lovers, you should hold back on your urges until you're off school grounds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm telling you, you're wrong. Me and Sayuki-senpai aren't lovers at all, and it wasn't sexual harassment either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter if I'm wrong. People will surely think the same as me if I were to release this photo online… right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So if I don't want this photo to be made public, I have to help you out, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu wanted Keiki to become a 'Love cupid' for her and Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he felt really bad selling out his trusted friend to a stalker girl like her, he had to prevent that photo from leaking at all costs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me hear the details," And that was how Keiki sold out his friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, I won't do anything that will violate the law."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. That should be obvious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to be told that by the person who took that photo without my consent…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, the most important thing is information. Since you're going to help me, you should know about my circumstances."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, a question. What was the trigger that made you fall in love with</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The trigger, huh - a hat."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was about a year prior when the students had just changed their uniforms. On that day, it was nice weather for a walk, so Koharu did. Koharu's hat blew away in a gust of wind before she realized it. It landed in a high tree, where she couldn't reach it. Queue the ikemen Shouma, who saw her plight and grabbed it back for her. It was a rather simple episode, but it still put a smile on Keiki's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. And that's how you fell in love with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I always wanted to talk to him but, uhm, I couldn't muster up any courage…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it makes sense since you're in different classes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To me, Akiyama-kun is something like a star in the night sky. The only thing I could do was take photos from afar…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's how the astronomy club room ended up like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought back to the countless photos of Shouma. He couldn't even imagine how long it must've taken her to gather such an ridiculous amount. Taking that into account, he really wanted to help this poor girl who had held feelings for his friend for such a long time without being able to confess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be fair, I do think that you have a really good chance with Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're completely in his strike-range. He's a lolicon after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the Akiyama Shouma that Ootori Koharu had feelings for was a lolicon. Taking that into consideration, he'd surely accept her feelings if she were to confess. She just had to get on the offensive-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I already know that Akiyama-kun has these sorts of interests. But this is my biggest problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because - I'm actually a third-year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmmm, what was that? She said something completely unbelievable just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, Ootori-san, what did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said, I am a third-year student. I'm actually older than Akiyama-kun, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're joking, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing her impactful confession, Keiki found himself staring at her small body. After all, she had the height of a grade school student. And her breasts were almost on the level of a certain blonde-haired Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">But in that moment, Keiki realized something - the fact that Koharu had been calling him 'Kiryuu-kun'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, a first-year student wouldn't address a second-year Senpai like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-san, would you be so kind as to stand up for a second?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Koharu stood in front of him, he looked at the color of her skirt. It had a blue color, which indicated that she was indeed a third-year student. Because of all the things that had happened recently, such as the revelation that his classmate was a BL-loving fujoshi, he hadn't paid any attention to a small detail like that at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your skirt is blue… so you really are my Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Here, look," She put both of her hands on her skirt and slightly lifted it up.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"If you flutter your skirt around like that, I'll be able to see your panties, you know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, sorry. What an embarrassing thing to do," She sat back down in her chair with slightly flushed cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, to think that Ootori-san was actually Ootori-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, Akiyama Shouma was a pure lolicon. He was the kind of true pervert who thought that it would be nice to date a girl from grade school. Could he really get a lolicon and an older girl together? Keiki really didn't think that it was possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, Ootori-senpai, but this seems impossible-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why?" Koharu showed a wonderful smile and pointed at her smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Keiki knew immediately what she wanted to tell him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu Keiki. I demand your wholehearted devotion! Become my love cupid!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His misgivings didn't change the fact that his duty was absolute. His enemy was an experienced lolicon. Even if Koharu started a full-front attack, she probably wouldn't stand any chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That reminds me… it's going to be June next week… and it'll be time to change uniforms… Hmmmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">A ray of hope in a hopeless situation. A certain idea flew into the cupid's mind. Although it would still prove rather difficult, he saw no other option with which he could beat the lolicon inside his trusted friend. He had to become a devil who could win with his clever scheme. </p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: Is the order a bunny girl?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the beginning of a new week, Monday after classes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki called his friend Shouma to the courtyard. The tennis ace and his classmate from class 2B. The ikemen wearing a white shirt. The lolicon that loves little girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you call me out here? Don't tell me; is this a confession?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Why in the world would it be that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Figures. Keiki is a big-breast-loving siscon, so there's no way you'd be interested in men."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. So don't say stuff that would get a fujoshi excited."</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially their classmate Nanjou Mao, because she actually was a hardcore fujoshi who already was drawing BL manga with Keiki and Shouma as the characters. Keiki certainly didn't want this meeting to become yet more 'material' for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, there's someone I'd like you to meet, Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. You can come out, Ootori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">From behind Keiki, a single girl stepped out. Since the season had changed, she was now wearing a pink skirt instead of a blue one. Her uniform was perfectly hidden by her parka, bringing out a cuteness induced by her small body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Clearly showing her nervousness, Ootori Koharu greeted Shouma with a "HHello."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it okay if I take this girl home with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we just calm down for now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like the ikemen lolicon had taken the bait.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Uhm, my name is Ootori Koharu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-san, huh? I'm Akiyama Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akiyama… senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being called 'Senpai' by a girl like you really lifted up my spirits!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, my apologies. I happened to get a bit excited."</p>
<p class="null-p">No wonder he would. No matter how you looked at it, Ootori Koharu had the body stature of a loli, with a beautiful face. But it was all according to plan. Specifically the 'Koharu-chan is a first year ☆' plan. A lolicon like Shouma would never go out with a girl older than him. Buying pictures of legal lolis was one thing, but Shouma lived by an important principle: No going out with legal lolis. In fact, every time a girl had confessed to Shouma, he would always decline her with an "I'm a lolicon after all." That's why Keiki and Koharu decided to deceive him by making it look like Koharu was actually a first year. First, Keiki wanted to build a solid relationship between them, and when the time was right, she would confess her actual age. The reason they had waited to enact their plan until this week was because it was officially time to switch uniforms, which a welcome chance for them.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, the skirt of the uniform was colour-coded by the year of the student.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had to keep the fact that she was a third-year a secret at all costs, or Shouma probably wouldn't look at her again after seeing her skirt color. In addition to that, they had hidden her blue ribbon with the parka, and she had changed her way of addressing him from 'Akiyama-kun' to 'Akiyamasenpai'.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her young-looking face, her still growing (?) breasts, and body, she completely was in strike-range for a lolicon like Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, why is Koharu-chan wearing a parka? Aren't you getting hot like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have weak skin, so I'm trying to protect myself from the sun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu probably had never expected that her parka could be so useful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got to know Ootori-san through my library work. It seems like she watched a match of the tennis club, and when we talked about Shouma she said that she'd really like to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really? Then did you see the match between athlete Nishimori and his opponent?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes, I did. I did."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shouma asked, Koharu was still a bit nervous as she answered. But, that was also pretty charming.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, it really was a wonderful match. It really got me excited how neither of them stepped down even once."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're both aiming for the top, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first I was cheering for Nishimori-san, but in the last half of the match, his opponent got the better of him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, exactly. And even though athlete Nishimori wasn't playing poorly, his opponent's serves were too good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. Just what you would expect from the former number 1 in the world. Even after his injury, he managed to jump back into the game like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them continued talking on and on about tennis-related stuff. After Koharu found out that Shouma was a member of the tennis club, she had started becoming interested in the sport, and began to watch official matches on TV. She even studied the rules and so on, and Keiki soon found himself completely left in behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, shoot. I have to get to my club now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Akiyama-senpai? I would like to talk about tennis with you again so, uhm, would it be okay if we exchanged email addresses?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Actually, I should be the one asking you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing them taking the first step by exchanging addresses, Keiki couldn't hold back his smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">This guy… his face looks so happy right now… I hope that everything ends well for the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought that, even though he had been basically threatened with a photo to help her out. For now, he just decided to apologize inside his heart for deceiving his friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about photos, Keiki remembered the countless photos of Shouma inside the astronomy club room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you two. How about we take a commemoration photo for your newfounded friendship?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that's a good idea," Shouma agreed to Keiki's proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So he says. Now, Ootori-san, stand next to Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the courtyard, the ikemen with the tall stature and the small girl wearing the parka stood next to each other. While Shouma wore a carefree smile, Koharu still looked a bit nervous. Having become the cameraman by default, Keiki took out his smartphone and took a photo.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you take a good picture?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it looks like it turned out good. How do I say it… the difference in height is crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of a Senpai-Kouhai picture, this looked more like a family photo between siblings. After Keiki sent the photos to their phones, Shouma went on his way. Until his back completely disappeared, Koharu kept staring at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that I could talk with Akiyama-kun like this… it felt like I dream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that there's anything keeping me in this world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no. You merely exchanged your contact addresses."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not just that. I actually managed to get a photo together with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see… this is the first picture you have of him that also has you in it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu had taken countless pictures of Shouma. But none of them had her in the frame.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Kiryuu-san. I'll treasure this photo," Embracing her phone, she had a blissful smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that face was beautiful enough that you could fall in love with her even if you weren't a lolicon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hello everyone. I am the prince searching for the Cinderella who dropped her panties, Kiryuu Keiki. It might be a bit sudden, but might you be familiar with the term 'bunny girl'? Just as the name suggests, it refers to a girl wearing bunny ears. Additionally, a bunny girl will wear sexy black tights, a shirt with a revealing breast region, a bunny tail, and so on. Basically everything that could get your heart racing. Every adolescent boy at least dreamed of meeting one once, but the chances are too slim for that, so they have to be satisfied with either the world of their dreams or videos on the Internet. But, that day, I happened to meet one. In front of me, there was an extremely cute bunny girl with blonde hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What's going on? W-What is this situation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a certain weekday after classes. As Keiki opened the door to the calligraphy room, there was a bunny girl. With shoulder-long blonde hair. Her small body was wrapped in a black costume. On her butt there was a fluffy round tail, and on her head were long bunny ears. Although the volume of her chest region was lacking, it gave off even more of an immoral feeling, and it became the most impactful part of the costume. Her fidgeting gestures and embarrassed expression were also quite the strategic weaponry. Keiki declared in his heart that this cute bunny girl in front of him was second to none. That precise cuteness made Keiki mutter the words "What's going on here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing this expected question, the bunny girl Koga Yuika answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is a reason for this. Yuika has to wear this bunny girl costume for a day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I don't really get it, but there's only one thing I have to do now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai? Why are you taking out your phone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I just thought that I'd take a commemorative photo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For what?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, cheese~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without asking for permission, he took a photo. That day, for the first time in his life, Keiki had seen a bunny girl, so he just had to take a photo. Now safely saved to his pictures folder was the bunny girl Yuika in an embarrassing pose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'll just name this 'The day my Kouhai became a bunny girl.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will you stop already? Yuika doesn't understand anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why did you dress up as a bunny girl, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Because this girl wants to join the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">Answering Keiki's question wasn't Yuika, but rather a girl with long black hair who appeared behind her. The girl with black hair reaching down to her thighs and big breasts was Tokihara Sayuki, the third-year club president of the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She wants to join the calligraphy club… why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's totally unfair, don't you think? You spent way more time in the calligraphy club with this Witch-senpai than you did in the library committee with Yuika, right? Yuika also wants to spend more time with Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Yuika-chan, by that, do you mean-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's words made Keiki's heart beat faster. Seeing her expression, he could feel his hopes starting to rise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika needs more time with Keiki-senpai so that she can turn him into her slave!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yup, that's what I thought." His hopes were immediately dashed.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a normal love-comedy, if the heroine were to say 'I want to spend more time with you,' then that would be a clear flag, but reality wasn't so kind towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first glance, Yuika might look like a lovable angel, but her interior is nothing more than an evil devil who wants to make Keiki her slave; a super hardcore sadist.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the contrary, Sayuki wants to become Keiki's dog; a super hardcore masochist.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the both of them were fighting over Keiki. Like there was only one boy like Keiki in the entire world. Like a pair of siblings fighting over the last slice of a cake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, Yuika couldn't stand it anymore. That Witch-senpai has such an advantageous position."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't think that our world is actually 100% fair all of the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is also a student here, so she should have the right to join the calligraphy club…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Koga-san is planning to take Keiki-kun away from me, and it really bothers me to no end, but I don't have any solid reason to reject your application. Although it really bothers me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you have to say that it bothers you twice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika also hates Witch-senpai," Said the bunny girl while pouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, even her angry face is cute… This is the problem with beauties like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's true that I can't deny her application, but just letting her join would've been boring, so I told her to wear this bunny girl outfit the whole day as a condition."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I don't really get why it has to be a bunny girl, but I'm not complaining."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that Keiki-kun would understand. Leaving out her real personality, her outer appearance certainly is cute, so I was sure that it would fit her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't want to be told that by a female molester."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also tried that costume on once, but it didn't fit me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bringing up the topic of Yuika's breasts is a declaration of war, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, it really bothers you that you have small breasts, I see. Seeing you react to a provocation of that level… it seems like both your outside and inside are childish."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. So it seems that your personality is as overblown as your breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki-senpai won't like it if your personality is so rude."</p>
<p class="null-p">You could almost see sparks flying inside the clubroom. It felt like they were having a war over the endless topic of breast size.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I really wanted to see Sayuki-senpai dressed as a bunny girl too…</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a shame that he couldn't see it, but you would probably have to add a R-rating if you wanted to show that. If the stimulation was too high, Keiki might just lose consciousness from blood loss. But, maybe that could be a saving grace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Bunny girl-san, could you pour us some tea?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh, Witch-senpai is always acting so high and mighty…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so you don't want to join the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Understood," With a frustrated expression, Yuika turned away.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, seeing that the two of them had resolved their dispute, Keiki could finally focus his attention on the other person who was also present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So… why is Nanjou here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting on a chair, Nanjou Mao lifted up her head from the book she was reading with a "Mhm?" This girl, who had reddish-brown hair tied together in a side-tail, opened her mouth with a displeased expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why, you ask…? I also joined the calligraphy club, that's why."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that we've become fellow club members, I hope that you'll treat me well~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Treat me well you say, you-."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki could finish his sentence, the girl returned to her book. It seemed like she'd still be acting as she always did even after joining the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just when I thought that things would calm down for a bit… but wait?</p>
<p class="null-p">Senpai? Is it fine for Nanjou not to wear the bunny girl costume?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-san is perfectly fine. She already paid me the compensation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Compensation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki took out a thin book. On the cover, there were two people: A boy who looked exactly like Keiki, and an ikemen who looked exactly like Shouma, who was pulling a kabe-don on said Keiki look-alike. Keiki immediately understood that this was a copy of Mao's new BL manga 'Shouto's and Keeki's creamy showdown.' It seemed like she had finished it while Keiki was busy playing cupid for Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why do you have that, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I'm a huge fan of Nanjou-san, or rather, Minami Mao-sensei."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A faithful fan in a place like this?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And this was the first time Keiki had heard Mao's pen-name: 'Minami Mao'. Since she had given Keiki's character the name 'Keeki', it looked like her naming sense wasn't all that great in general.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you accepted her club application in return for this book?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not it. I actually waited in line at the official event to get this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what did she give you in the end?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As soon as her newest work is completed, I will receive the first copy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaa, this sounds like a shady deal to me…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I'm collecting every single book of the 'Shouto and Keeki Series.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhhh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This new work was also superb. Seeing Keeki's expression as he was completely overwhelmed by Shouto made me so excited. So did their thick cream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It has the complete opposite effect on me, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a tragedy to be forced to listen to Sayuki's detailed summary of what happened to a character when you're the actual model for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Yuika returned to the group with a plate and several cups of tea on top if it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the book that Mao-senpai drew, right? What's it about?" Since she was a real bookworm, that question was to be expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">But no matter how much she was interested, this wasn't just a normal book.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Yuika-chan! These books aren't meant to be seen by kids!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is a high school student, though, same as everyone here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're interested, I can give it to you. As a token of you joining the club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Really? Isn't it an important book of yours?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind. I have two other copies at home, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay…? Then Yuika will take you up on that offer. Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Confused by the sudden turn of her personality, the bunny girl took the book with caution. Keiki, for his part, gave up on everything when he saw this scene unfolding in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika then proceeded to open the book, only for her blue eyes to open up wide in surprise. "T-This is-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's book started the climax at page 1. The stage was a love hotel, with an erotic atmosphere surrounding the characters. Resting on the bed, Shouta (butt-naked) spoke with a "Trying to run away? What a bad boy you are…" as he brought his body closer to Keeki, who responded with "N-No more, I will go crazy…" as he tried to get away (butt-naked). However, with no great resistance from Keeki at all, the fiendish Shouta came closer to Keeki's butthole, opening it enough to have his way with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-senpai is in grave danger…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not me! I was just being used as a basis for the character, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is…… so immoral! Indecent!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say that, but you won't avert your gaze. Koga-san, you're quite the unexpected lecher, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… Buuuuut…"The blonde-haired girl's face was bright red and her eyes were spinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was safe to say that although she was embarrassed, she was still interested.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Yuika's first encounter with this stuff, Sayuki showed a soft smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to be embarrassed. Every woman will be charmed by this world sooner or later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-senpai……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their relationship seemed to have improved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A friendship born by BL manga is something wonderful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like hell it is," Mao muttered as she gazed at the two girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-senpai, will you give Yuika your autograph?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure~"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the scene played out in front of Keiki, he could only let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, that's another faithful reader……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy for every new fan of Nanjou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It only means more tragedy for me…" Keiki moaned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's time to get down to business," Sayuki changed the topic with a serious expression. "Hiding it at this point won't work anymore, and we've already talked about the circumstances with Nanjou-san. What me and Kogasan really are, and how we're competing for Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, you've been talking about 'slave' and 'female molester', so I'd guessed something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Kiryuu actually was a candidate for being an owner or being a slave, huh. It seems like you also have it hard," Mau said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're saying that as if you're a bystander but you're one of my problems," Keiki answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the one who drew the BL manga, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, his phone in his pocket vibrated. As he checked it, he saw that he had received an email. It came from Mao, who was still present in the room. It read 'Keep the reason why I joined the club a secret from the two of them. Otherwise I'll show Mizuha the BL manga you're a model for.' Answering with an 'Anything but that', Keiki accepted her request.</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of wicked person would make his little sister read that BL in front of him? The secret she was talking about was that she was trying to be a hindrance for every possible girlfriend for Keiki. After all, if Keiki actually managed to get a girlfriend, he would spend less time with Shouma, and that would result in less material for Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">And for her, him becoming the master of Sayuki or the slave of Yuika would probably have the same result as him getting a lover. Though, in their case, he couldn't be happier that she was trying to get in their way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, since we've cleared everything up, let's start with some real club activities."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Yuika also wanted to start her own work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also gotta work on my new project," Mao said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki headed towards the low table inside the room. Yuika sat down on a chair close to that, and Mao, who was already seated, took some manga materials out of her bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of them started their own work. His classmate started drawing her BL manga with him as a model, the bunny girl continued writing her picture book about the princess and the prince, and just when he thought that Sayuki would be the only one doing serious club work, he caught a glance of the paper in front of her. It read 'Punishment is a reward.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is wrong with this club…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was not a single normal girl in this club. Although he should have been happy that the club had gotten new members, the selection of people in it was very questionable.</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day, the calligraphy club was haunted by perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the way home from school, Keiki happened to cross paths with his little sister Mizuha, who spotted him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? If it isn't my Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is I, yes. Was Mizuha-san out to buy our food and groceries?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. We're still missing some things at home."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing casual clothes and holding her favorite eco-friendly reusable bag. It was filled to the brim with various foods and other household materials.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll hold it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it's pretty heavy, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It did buy some soy sauce after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really wish you'd tell me beforehand. It's the duty of the Onii-chan to carry this stuff for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhmmm, but I thought that Nii-san was still in his club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say club, but I almost never do any club activities."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're always cleaning the room or reading a book, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. That's why you can always call for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm, I get it. I'll do that next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that the siblings started walking next to each other. At the home they were living at, it was only Keiki and Mizuha. Their parents were often busy with work, and could only come home very rarely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Was there always an ice cream store here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like they just finished it. The girls in my class were talking about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then your big brother will treat you to some today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Yay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's eat it in the park."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ordering two portions of ice cream, they headed towards the nearby park. Over there, countless kids were playing. Sitting down on a bench, Mizuha took out a plastic spoon. Inside a paper cup were five ice cream balls, every single one with a different color. Chocolate, strawberry… everything a girl's heart could desire.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm…~ So cold, and delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right~? Even though it's only June, it's pretty hot today, so it tastes even better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for treating me, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Mizuha took another scoop and made a blissful face. As only three portions were left, she stopped her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Mao-chan and Yuika-chan joined the calligraphy club, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was fast… Ah, yeah they did. Sadly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's more a problem of what's going to happen…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't tell her that the calligraphy club was infected with perverts. And he didn't want to let her know that these girls would be competing for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone is just doing what they want. Nanjou's drawing a manga, while</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika-chan is creating a picture book."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though it's the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though it's the calligraphy club. Well, it's not like I'm doing any club work either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really seems like you have a lot of freedom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since they have more members now, I doubt that Sayuki-senpai really needs me anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, he had joined the club so that it wouldn't be dismissed. He only did so out of a choice to help Sayuki. And since the number of members had gone up, he started to think that it wasn't necessary for him to go there anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Really, Nii-san is always like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tone sounded abnormally aggravated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure that Tokihara-senpai is extremely thankful to Nii-san, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sure that she would be sad if you said something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he had treated her to a parfait in that cafe, she told him that she was thankful. Thankful because Keiki had saved her beloved calligraphy club. And her words, paired with a bright smile, were without a doubt her real feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nii-san said that he wanted to stop being a family, I would be sad too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, there's no way I would ever say that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't have anyone who'd treat me to ice cream anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the reason?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki understood what Mizuha was trying to say. He also thought that Sayuki would be sad if he left the club. Whether it was because of romantic feelings, or simply because she was thankful to him, it was still a fact. And Keiki also thought that he would get lonely without the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know what you're saying that for, but if you want to thank me, I'd like some caramel flavored ice cream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll gain weight, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind if I get to eat more ice cream."</p>
<p class="null-p">Accepting her wish, he presented some of his own ice cream.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they finished eating, they decided to head home. In that moment, a baseball rolled in front of Mizuha's feet, and she picked it up. A second later, a boy wearing a glove and sports trousers came running over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry! Thank you very much!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, how energetic. Here you go~" With these words, she threw the ball back.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, instead of going back, the boy just stood there and looked at the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you two a couple?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong. We're siblings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Wooow, I really couldn't tell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, is that so. I don't think that we look like a couple, though," Mizuha said with a smile, but the boy still wasn't satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, but Onee-chan is so cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Am I being hit on right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if the other person was a kid, Keiki couldn't just watch this silently, which is why, to protect his little sister, he stood in front of the young boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, young boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, mister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't hand over Mizuha that easily. If you really want to marry her, you have to have an annual income of ten million yen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, this person's a siscon!" The boy said as he ran back to his friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Mizuha saw him off with Keiki's favorite smiling face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, it's true that Nii-san is a siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'd rather be a siscon. Unlike lolicons, police forgive us much more easily."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa, that's heavy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go home already. The food will go bad if we don't put it in the refrigerator."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki started walking, Mizuha followed suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do we really look like lovers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm, I wonder. I do have confidence that we are closer than lovers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not so sure about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm joking…… Let's go home, Nii-san," With these words, she waved her skirt as she picked up the speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he even realized it, the sun started setting and colored the sky a strong orange.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Mizuha-san, what's for dinner tonight?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'll have some japanese food. Salty-grilled mackerel with some eggs, seaweed with miso soup, and spinach as the finishing touch."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, spinach, huh. Very nice. That wins a perfect score for healthy nourishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're happy about that? Be more happy about the mackerel, they're really expensive right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was a conversation with little to no importance, Keiki could feel the warmth coming from it. He wondered if that was because he felt the safety of his own family. It was a feeling that told him 'This is the place where you belong'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fast forward until 11pm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was sitting in his own room. Having finished eating Mizuha's delicious dinner, he hopped into the bath and was now back within his own four walls. Lying face up on his bed, he had one piece of paper in his hand. Right in the middle of the white paper, there were the words 'I like you.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that you like me, why won't you appear in front of me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the beginning of May, he had received his first love letter. However, neither on the pink envelope, nor on the letter itself, could any name be found. And for some reason, in addition to that love letter, there were also a white pair of panties left behind on top of that table. Calling the mysterious girl 'The Cinderella who had dropped her panties,' he had determined three candidates that had the highest possibility of being the sender.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were the girls that were present during the cleaning operation on that day. There was another girl helping out, but since that was Keiki's sister Mizuha, he removed her from the list of possible candidates. While he was on the search for Cinderella, he happened to unravel the secrets of all three girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every last one of them was a closet pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaaah," Letting out a sigh, he put down the hand that was holding the letter, "So who's my Cinderella now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After finding that letter, he hadn't had any more contact with Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging from that, the girl didn't have any intention of revealing herself. Even now, the prince of this story still hadn't found the faintest trace of his Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Are you listening, Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki came back to his senses, he found himself in the astronomy club room. The curtains were opened, letting in a ray of light that illuminated the room. And, as always, countless pictures of Shouma were covering the walls, all the way to the ceiling. And in the middle of all of that, Koharu was sitting on a chair. Since there was no need to hide her ribbon, she kept her parka open, maybe because she had gotten hot over the day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-san, have you been spacing out? You have to listen to me. We're in the middle of our operation meeting after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for that was because he didn't get enough sleep. The night before, he couldn't stop thinking about Cinderella, and found himself unable to fall asleep. He hadn't been able to focus on today's lessons, either, and had spaced out during his conversation with Koharu as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, you don't seem to be in good spirits. Do you want to talk with me about something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I still owe you quite a bit, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might take a while to explain, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind. If it's time, I have plenty of it," His Senpai answered with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they hadn't known each other for all too long, Keiki already knew that she was a good girl. That's why he decided to tell her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… So you're searching for the Cinderella who dropped her panties, huh," Having explained the circumstances, Koharu muttered to recapitulate. "A love letter without a name. And a pair of white panties. And an unlocked door without a key… This is quite the mystery."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since the love letter was left inside the clubroom after the cleaning, I had guessed that it must've been one of the girls who took part in it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it turned out that all the girls were total perverts, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, regrettably."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, is there anybody else who knows about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only Shouma. But I've kept the girls' real identities a secret. They're trying their best to hide it, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Then, I'll make sure that your secret is safe with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd really appreciate that, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Kiryuu-kun just keeps gathering secrets."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it feels like I'm their accomplice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's return to the topic at hand. When you returned from washing the bucket, there's a chance that your Cinderella was still in the same room with you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Even though I'm 100% sure that I locked the door, the club supervisor checked later and told me that the door was open. Someone must've opened it from the inside while I was gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, but that also means that it might've been a girl who wasn't a part of the cleaning operation. When all the other girls left, she might've snuck into the room and hid when she heard you returning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why would she take that risk?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I'm not saying that it's any less likely that it was one of the girls that were present. But, looking at the current situation, I think you should consider that it might be someone from outside the club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Meaning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Instead of four girls, or three girls if we're not counting your little sister, there might be a fifth candidate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A fifth person… so someone from outside the club…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That is something that Keiki and Shouma hadn't thought of of at the beginning. After all, Cinderella could've just left the love letter in Keiki's shoe locker, or on his desk in the classroom. There should've been no need to risk getting caught by putting it in the clubroom. But since the other candidates showed no current signs of being Cinderella, he had to consider the possibility of it being a girl from outside the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if it really comes to that, then I have no hope of finding her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would mean that every girl in this school is a possible Cinderella candidate."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no other lead than the white panties. Meaning that, unlike the real Cinderella with her glass shoe, he couldn't just ask every single girl in the school if the panties belonged to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it means that every girl who went to that part of the school on that day is a possible candidate…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If only he had some more information-- "…Wait a moment. What about Okita-sensei?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the adviser of the calligraphy club. Since she came to check on the room, she might have seen someone walking around at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much, Ootori-senpai. Thanks to you, I might've found another clue."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad if I was able to help. I hope that you find your Cinderella soon," She smiled at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to her, Keiki had found another ray of hope. Keeping that in mind, his motivation returned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So a fifth candidate, huh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the astronomy club, Keiki stopped in front of his shoe locker.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing he could think about right now was the Koharu's hypothesis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If there really is a fifth girl, I wonder what she's like…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he took out his shoes from the shoe locker, he went to check if he had gotten any messages on his phone - but as he went to take it out of his pocket, he realized.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, dammit. I must've forgotten it in the classroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he had changed for gym class, he had put it inside his desk. Since he couldn't just leave it there until tomorrow, he headed back to the classroom once again. Since most of the students already had either gone home or were busy with their club activities, the main building was almost completely empty. As Keiki went up the stairs to the second floor, he saw the shadow of a person walking down at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her hair in a short bob, her bangs barely hid one of her eyes. She was carrying a huge number of printouts in her hands. She was someone who Keiki also was fairly familiar with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's name was Fujimoto Ayano. She was one of Keiki's fellow second years, and was the vice president of the student council. Since she was in the student council, she had occasionally visited the calligraphy club for her duties, which is where Keiki had met her.</p>
<p class="null-p">…But in that moment, the topmost paper of the stack she was holding fell down. As she went to take another step--</p>
<p class="null-p">"-?! W-Watch out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't stop her foot in time. When she stepped on the paper, she slipped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dammit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her starting to fall towards him, he decided to use his own body as a cushion. After the impact, the rest of the papers fell all over them. Seeing as how he had managed to stop her painful descent, he let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My heart was beating like crazy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mine did too," He thought his heart would stop, that's how much he had panicked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, if it isn't Kiryuu-kun from my neighbouring class. Thank you, you really saved me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're welcome. You're not hurt, are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It doesn't seem like it. I'm fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then could you let go of me now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah……… huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she started raising herself up, her movements came to a sudden halt and she quickly lifted up her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………, ………, ……?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The eye that wasn't hidden by her bangs opened wide like the eye of a startled cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This… this is… don't tell me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto… san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's cheeks started turning red. And as if she was reunited with a loved one she hadn't seen for years, she started pushing her head into Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh?! W-Wai- Fujimoto-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please. Let me stay like this a bit more? I don't…… want to be separated from Kiryuu-kun right now……"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"?!" These words echoed inside Keiki's head like a clap of thunder.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like his heart was being stabbed. And the soft feeling on his chest robbed him of any logical thinking. Not to mention the gentle aroma coming from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">W-What kind of situation is this?!</p>
<p class="null-p">As he had been going his way towards his classroom, there was suddenly a girl falling towards him, and he happened to catch her inside his chest-</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had never had a girlfriend in his entire life, this felt like a huge flag for him. Without picking up the scattered printouts, they both of them stayed like this. Earlier, his heartbeat had been pounding from surprise, but right now, it was pounding for a completely different reason. </p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: My Hentai Love-Comedy Is Wrong As I Expected</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Excuse me. I am Kiryuu Keiki from class 2B. I have business with Okita-sensei."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lunch break. Keiki asked that at the teacher's office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kiryuu. What is it?" Asked the teacher in the middle of her twenties. Okita-sensei had short hair, narrow eyes, and was wearing a typical business suit. She was the adviser of the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was something that I wanted to ask Sensei. It's about the cleaning operation back in May."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, good work back then. Tokihara can be a bit troublesome sometimes. Even though she's a genius when it comes to calligraphy, she slacks off when it comes to the cleanup work afterwards."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha, you're telling me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? Did something happen in the club room again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's not that. That day when you went to check on the door of the club room, did you see any girls walking around in that area?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Ahh, now that you mention it, on the way to the clubroom there was a girl coming my way. I remembered her because of her distinct hairstyle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who was that girl, if I may ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto. The vice president of the student council, Fujimoto Ayano."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Fujimoto-san is……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a fellow second-year, he had talked to her before. Not to mention what had happened yesterday on the stairs when he caught her mid-fall- "What happened, Kiryuu? You're getting red. Do you have a fever?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No. I'm fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had just happened to remember the moment when Ayano snuggled up to his chest. He didn't exactly expect her name to crop up here, but it seemed like he had found the 5th Cinderella candidate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the teacher's office with new information, Keiki made his way towards the courtyard. He sat down on a bench in a tree's shadow and thought about what he had just learned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Fujimoto-san was near the clubroom that day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it made sense for her since she might've had some work over there as the student council vice president. But, on that day, was she really there by pure coincidence? Especially right after Keiki went home?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Fujimoto-san Cinderella?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You called?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaaaa?!" Hearing a voice behind his back, Keiki let out a scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">Behind the bench was a girl with one eye covered by her long bangs - Fujimoto Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"F-Fujimoto-san?!" Keiki jumped to his feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. The vice president of the student council, Fujimoto Ayano-san," She gave a playful introduction as she tilted her head, "To think that we would meet again. Might this be destiny?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that was totally on purpose. You can't sneak up on someone and just call that 'destiny.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How boring, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you here, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was searching for Kiryuu-kun. I wanted to thank him for saving me yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to thank me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I managed to survive that fall unscathed because of Kiryuu-kun, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san is very sincere, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, with that feeling in mind, I want to give you this," She took out some cookies that were very beautifully plastic-wrapped, "If you want, you can eat them here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, thanks…I was getting a bit hungry," Keiki once more sat down on the bench.</p>
<p class="null-p">And next to him, Ayano did the same. Their shoulders were almost touching, and Keiki imagined that to an outside observer they must've looked like lovers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto-san really is getting close to me…</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of her sweet aroma, Keiki started to get even more nervous. While trying to hide that, Keiki placed a cookie inside his mouth. They had a good mixture of sweetness and bitterness from the dark chocolate chips, and you could tell that she had put a lot of work into the dough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, they're delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. They are handmade."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san made these?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm good at creating sweets."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hooo. That's awesome. They might be even more delicious than the ones they sell at the stores around here," Stating his honest feelings, he ate another one.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was enjoying the cookies, Ayano just stared at him as they sat on the bench. She came closer, almost close enough to touch their faces together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you think that you're getting a bit too close?" "I don't think so," She denied his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them were close enough to clearly make out the colour of each other's eyes, and Keiki's heart pounded in his chest in response. Since Keiki had never had a girlfriend before, he hadn't built up any immunity towards girls. And in addition to that, Ayano was even a Cinderella candidate . Thinking that this girl in front of him might have feelings for Keiki made it impossible for him to calm down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… t-that's right, I have to get back to the classroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lunch break is almost over, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm… it's a shame, but I wouldn't want you to be late for class," She said as she pulled away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having finally broken free, he took a deep breath. Ayano followed suit, and after staring at her classmate with her one eye- she came closer once more and hugged him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She acted just like a small kitten snuggling against its mother. Keiki was once more completely overwhelmed by the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-Fujimoto-san?! What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm charging."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Charging?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. With this, I can give it my all for the afternoon classes," Saying these cryptic words, she separated from Keiki, "See you later." With slightly flushed cheeks, the girl escaped towards the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What was that about? She looked really friggin' cute……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Ayano really was Keiki's Cinderella. Since he had found out that all of the other candidates were nothing more than a bunch of perverts, his search was still ongoing. And Ayano was actually seen walking near the clubroom at the time he found the love letter, if what Okita-sensei said was true.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Might I'll actually get a cute girlfriend this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She might act a bit weird from time to time, but she is indeed a beauty to behold, and in addition to being the student council vice president, she's also good at creating sweets. Altogether, she scored a lot of points in Keiki's book.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that a new potential Cinderella had appeared, the prince found his hopes rising again, whether he wanted them to or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">The astronomy club room's walls and ceiling were still covered with photos of Shouma. Kiryuu Keiki and Ootori Koharu were sitting around a table in said room. Having asked Koharu to investigate the new Cinderella candidate, he was eager to see what she had found out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, Lieutenant Ootori, please proceed with your report."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood, Captain. Take a look at this, if you will."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu took out several photos and put them on the table they were seated at.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of them were pictures of the vice president of the student council, Fujimoto Ayano. Pictures of her walking around the school grounds. Pictures of her in the school building, busily performing student council duties. Pictures of her eating during break. Pictures of her playing with a stray cat late after school. There seemed to be a lot of different sides to her that Keiki had never seen before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, just what I would expect from Lieutenant Ootori. You really took some great photos there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I humbly accept your praise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what is your opinion of vice president Fujimoto?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Judging from my investigation, she is an excellent student, and I couldn't find anything suspicious about her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… Well, she's not just the vice president for show, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">Excellent grades. Athletic skills not so much. Idolized by her fellow student council members, and very popular with the teachers as well. The perfect honour student.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, of course, you cannot ignore her recent contact with Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Several of the pictures that Koharu had taken were of her together with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that incident at the stairs, it looked like she sought him out often.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she sees his face, she runs over to him. Holding his clothes, touching him with her hands, like a little kitten that wants to be spoiled. And every time this happened, it made Keiki's heart beat faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you think that Fujimoto-san is the Cinderella who dropped her panties, Ootori-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do think that there's a chance, yes. She did have a good chance of coming around the club room building during that incident because of her job as the vice president."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also - this is just an aside - but, although she's mostly expressionless, she sometimes can be seen with this big smile on her face. It makes her look really cute, which is why she's popular with a few of the boys."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's this 'gap moe' thing, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that Keiki thought her smile on the pictures was really cute. Even seeing her expression whenever she ate made his heart thump.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is this? If you want, I can continue the investigation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that should be enough. Thank you for collecting all this information.</p>
<p class="null-p">You really helped me out big time."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was perfect work from a professional stalker. To gather so many pictures in this short amount of time is really something else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, I'll go and search for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give it your best, please. I'll be cheering for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for this, even though I should be working as your cupid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to rush that. I do think it's better that I take my time. I've spent the past year with unrequited feelings, so there's no need to hurry up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But once this case is cleared up, I expect some more help from you, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, I still have to work hard myself to approach Akiyama-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please be careful. It would be troublesome if he found out about all of this."</p>
<p class="null-p">That she is actually older than him, that she is actually a stalker. That she is hiding these dangerous secrets. But considering her well-executed investigation, there shouldn't be any need to worry.</p>
<p class="null-p">There still is no definite proof that Ayano is the girl who sent him the love letter. Maybe she is trying her best to hide it from him. Either way, Keiki needed to work harder. This is, after all, the duty of the prince. To search for his Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But still, she is the vice president of the student council; how should I approach her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving aside lunch break, she should probably have work after classes, making it hard to approach her from his end. She really is like a cat; if you want to meet her you can't, and if you're not looking for her, she comes strolling by.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having left the astronomy clubroom behind him, Keiki went downstairs towards the calligraphy room on the second floor. When he opened the door, he immediately saw a blonde-haired girl sitting on a chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Yuika-chan? Where's Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he could see Sayuki's bag on a chair, the person herself was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're asking about Witch-senpai, she just left. She said that she had some business to attend to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I wonder where she went. Nanjou said that she would be buying ink, too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, it's only the two of us right now, right? Ehehehe," Yuika gave him a warm smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like the green ribbon on her uniform suggested, she was a first year, and Keiki's cute kouhai. Saving that smile in his deepest memories, he went to take a seat on the same chair as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, something pulled on on his legs, making him fall over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah?! - W-What is it?!" Looking over to where that sensation came</p>
<p class="null-p">from, he saw a thin string. "A string? Why is that here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-It's time for another punishment, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki even realized it, she had already gotten up from her seat. She then proceeded to walk over to her Senpai and sit on top of his belly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Y-Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What greeted him as he looked up was a gaze as cold as ice. As the Kouhai looked down on her Senpai, she started moving her pink lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Please take responsibility."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After Keiki-senpai did that to Yuika, she can't get married anymore!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In Yuika's dream last night, Keiki-senpai appeared."</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Dream?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A little while ago, Yuika was so devastated because Witch-senpai said that her breasts were too small, so Yuika decided to ask Keiki-senpai for advice. When she did, he told her 'If you really want them to get bigger, fondling them is the best idea,' and that's exactly what you did. You forced yourself onto Yuika and started fondling her breasts, countless times!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a false charge! We're talking about a dream here, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And after you were finished, you said something like 'Small breasts really are the best!', you know?! Even though you're supposed to be Yuika's slave, you were acting like you were her master! Yuika has never felt so humiliated!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know that other me! And I'm not your slave, anyway!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then take responsibility and become Yuika's slave already!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly decline!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koga Yuika was a cute looking pervert who wanted to make Keiki her slave. A hardcore sadist that had once shoved her own freshly-worn panties into his mouth. Merely remembering that incident made Keiki shiver all over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that so…? It seems like there's a need for some punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Punishment…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will have you go through the same thing as her. Then we can call it quits, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Presiding judge! I plead for my innocence!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Declined. This trial goes under Yuika's law."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Absurd!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that's decided, Yuika will be fondling Senpai's chest as she pleases, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, do you even realize what you're saying right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's Yuika's line. You have no right to veto here," She let out a small giggle. "-Hey, Senpai? This is your punishment for disgracing Yuika, you know? Now Yuika will be the one to disgrace you, so please taste the shame that Yuika had in her dream, okay?" Saying that in a soft voice, she started softly rubbing Keiki's chest with her small hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, what a cute voice, Senpai. Like a girl," She had an expression filled with ecstasy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, stop-ahnnn?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, wonderful. So wonderful, Senpai. Please let Yuika listen to your embarrassed voice even more!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's embarrassment started rising to his head, making him blush to his ears. Sayuki surely would be happy to be treated like this, but sadly, Keiki was completely normal in that regard. There is no way that he could withstand this disgrace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Please stop already…! I'm really not into this-!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to reserve chastity for his future girlfriend, he tried to push Yuika away. However, his hand landed perfectly on the girl's chest region.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…H-Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He happened to grab one of her breasts with this right hand. A perfect fit.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, unable to hold back his curiosity, he continued to fondle it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, they're soft…"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">They might be small, but they definitely give off that feminine softness. Since they were completely different from the overwhelming pair that Sayuki has, they gave off a completely different charm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he realized it, Yuika's shoulders were trembling and her face was a mixture of anger and bashfulness. Seeing her like this called Keiki back to reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well, how do I say it… t-this just makes it fair? Something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai---you love-comedy protagonist!!!!!!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love-comedy protagonist?! What's that supposed to be!? It sounds really insulting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sinner immediately pulled his hands away from Yuika's underdeveloped fruits when she gave him that title, only for her to dash out of the club room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Y-Yuika-chan?!" His call was answered by the loud slam of the door closing. "Now I've really done it……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's position immediately changed from the victim to the molester in mere seconds. He never expected to experience one of these 'lucky pervert' moments like the protagonist of a love-comedy story. And Yuika surely didn't expect her dream to turn into reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… They might've been small, but they weren't bad at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were on a completely different level than Sayuki's. It was like comparing small Japanese sweets to a rice cake filled with bean jam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although the size might be different, they're both delicious enough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Dwelling in this feeling of guilt wouldn't do him any better, so he decided to get rid of the tripwire Yuika had trapped him with. After he had finished, someone knocked on the door of the club room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder who it is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika had just dashed out of the room, and the other members surely wouldn't knock on the door. Tilting his head in confusion, he answered with a "Come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The door opened, and the girl who had entered with these words had one eye covered by her bangs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Fujimoto Ayano from the student council. I came here to inspect the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the person who Keiki had been trying to catch.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this school, the clubs get inspected by a member of the student council at least twice a year, though it is less of an inspection and more of a formality to check on club expenses and so on. Normally, giving the details would be the job of the president, but that person wasn't present at this moment. Since Keiki couldn't make the girl stand there until the president arrived, he showed her to a seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-senpai isn't here right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope. It seems like she had some business she had to attend to… Ah, I just got an email from her."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he checked his phone, he saw that Sayuki had sent him an email already. It said that he could show her the official papers. Also, at the end of the message, she added 'I've heard that recently, a lot more people are keeping pets. I wonder what they would do with a beautiful, big breasted woman like me?'. She was probably trying to make Keiki feel bad, but he decided to ignore her for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like we have the papers right here, so could you wait a little bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'll wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">Opening the box that they were in, he took out everything necessary. While he was doing that, he started a conversation with Akino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Student council work is pretty hard, right? This investigation stuff is probably a huge pain in the ass, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's still important. Somebody has to check if the clubs are properly using their budgets. And if a club isn't, we have to cut their budget accordingly." "I see. You have to properly check everything that's money related."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. To ensure an appropriate student life, even jobs like these are important."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki finished gathering the necessary papers, he turned around, only to see Ayano staring in a particular direction. Following her gaze, Keiki saw a normal locker. Since it only contained a few of Sayuki's private materials, the locker was generally unused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No… it's nothing." Her gaze went back to normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he thought that it was a bit weird, he decided to forget about it and hand over the papers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that everything you need?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm… everything's there. It's fine. Thank you," Having checked over the file, she stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Keiki thought that she was going to leave the room again, she instead kept standing in the same spot and turned her eyes towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun……you're a love-comedy protagonist?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You heard that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did. And right after that, a blonde-haired girl came running out. She was really fast."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what was that about? Love-comedy protagonist-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you please not call me that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, there's something I would like to request from Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There will be a volunteer trash pickup event pretty soon. But there aren't enough people right now, so I was hoping that Kiryuu-kun might help us out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Volunteer track pickup, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally Keiki wasn't one to help out with this sort of thing, but he couldn't turn down Ayano asking him right to his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, I'll help out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Thank you, I'm happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a face that really showed her happiness, she once more came closer to hug Keiki. But this time, she also rolled her head against his chest, like a cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you stick to me like this, I'll get embarrassed……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being looked at with upturned eyes in that position, he thought that Fujimoto would start hearing his heartbeat. They were at the distance that they could kiss if they moved a little bit closer. Her lips looked even sweeter than the cookies that she had made, and he started thinking that he would like to get a taste of them. In the clubroom, a wolf was about to be born. But in that moment…</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly does this mean, Keiki-kun?" A cold voice interrupted their sweet atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, the door was open, and Tokihara Sayuki was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is there another woman in our love nest?" Said Sayuki with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love nest… eh? What does she mean?" Asked the confused Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this development…?" And Keiki was standing between the two of them, on this weird battlefield.</p>
<p class="null-p">A battle between the dog-like senior student, and the cat-like vice president. And with that, another reason for Keiki's future headaches started to sprout.</p>
<p class="null-p">The volunteer track pickup day, a few days later.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes, in the middle of about twenty students that would participate in the work, there were the figures of Keiki, Ayano, and Sayuki who had changed into jerseys.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you here as well, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my duty as your pet to help you out, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, what exactly is Tokihara-senpai saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to pay any attention to her, Fujimoto-san. She's just joking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. Still, I'm grateful that she's willing to help us out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's not like I'm trying to help you or anything, Fujimoto-san," Sayuki glared at Ayano with a displeased expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">After what had happened a few days prior, Sayuki was still rather hostile towards Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today's event was organized by the student council, and the people were divided into groups, with a member of the council leading each. Sayuki and Keiki were in the group with Ayano, and their working area was the riverbank. They were each equipped with cotton gloves, trash bags, and grabber tongs. After everyone was provided with their equipment, they split up and went with their groups.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki walked in the middle as they headed towards their destination, with Sayuki on his right and Ayano on his left. Unlike Keiki and Ayano, Sayuki was only wearing shorts instead of long trousers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Keiki-kun, my underwear today is a strong black."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of confession is that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun looked like he was interested."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really never thought anything of the sort……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like always, she was talking about the dumbest stuff, which made Keiki retort unconsciously. While the two of them were talking like this, Ayano, who was walking next to them, also came closer to Keiki. "Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their shoulders were about to touch. She looked really cute as she tried not to make eye contact with Keiki. Like a jealous cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, could you please not cling to Keiki-kun like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I already belong to Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? So Tokihara-senpai and Kiryuu-kun are going out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, our relationship is even deeper than that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so, Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're not going out, then there should be no problem. For example, if I were to do something like this……" Ayano snuggled closely to Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki looked at that with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hmpf, even if you do that, Keiki-kun likes big breasts like mine more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that I can't win against size, but I have confidence in my form," With these words, she pressed her chest onto Keiki even more. "…How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Even if you ask me that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that she couldn't beat Sayuki, but that didn't mean that Keiki wouldn't get excited. For an adolescent boy like Keiki, it was still a moment of blessing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I hate myself for not being able to tell her to stop…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's gaze got colder by the second, but nobody could honestly blame Keiki in this situation. After all, every boy has a hidden pervert hidden inside them.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they had arrived at the river bank, they started their work. Because there weren't many people helping, it was a lot of work for the three of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm… it looks like there was no need at all for me to join this volunteer work. I did it only to investigate Fujimoto-san, after all." Keiki muttered as he picked up an empty juice pack from the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, they were in this deserted place, but Ayano was wholeheartedly working on picking up the trash around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's really into it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. If an UFO were to go by her head, she probably wouldn't even notice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And why is Sayuki-senpai here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Sayuki was standing next to Keiki with empty hands. She was neither wearing gloves, nor was she carrying a garbage bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you slacking off again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say that. I actually found some trash that's hard for me to move alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Can you help me out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, is that so. Where is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The place where she took him was under a huge bridge. In the shadow of said bridge, the girl stopped her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, where is the trash you were talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that was a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was saying that to get you over here. To be alone with you for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you do that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you know that dogs get jealous when they see their owner with another dog?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki……senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are other times when they just want to cling to them-Like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, Keiki was pushed against the wall of a pillar. And, as he was pressed against the wall like that, Sayuki pushed her own body against him, gluing them to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa-?! Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At his back was cold concrete, and at his front there was the heat of another person pressing against him. In this case, it was a girl, which made his body burn up even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Your breasts…! T-They're hitting me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's no use screaming like that. A lot of cars drive on the road above us but hardly any pedestrians. And since we separated from Fujimoto-san, no one will come to save you." With slightly flushed cheeks and watery eyes, she looked up at him. "First the blonde Kouhai, then the tsundere classmate, and now it's the vice president from the student council? Keiki-kun… you're liked by too many women." As she said that, she brought her face closer to his and licked his cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyaauu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you let out an unexpectedly cute scream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-S-S-S-Sayuki-senpai?! What are you-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What am I doing, you ask? I'm marking you. So that the other girls know that you belong to me. That you're my owner." She then licked his cheek again, and made her way downwards, licking his neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time her tongue touched his skin, it tickled, and a feeling of danger assaulted him, like he would go crazy if this kept going-</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is clearly not okay, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt like his chastity was at risk here.</p>
<p class="null-p">How can I get out of this situation?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just yesterday, his man-chest was fondled by Yuika, and he got out of it by accidentally fondling Yuika's breasts in return. But since Sayuki was completely pressing her chest against him, he couldn't reach them. And, knowing her, she probably wouldn't stop with that. She even said that she was a rather horny girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Sayuki today was uncontrollable like a large dog…… Large dog?</p>
<p class="null-p">That reminds me, that old man on the countryside had a large dog…</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was still a little kid, they often visited the house of his grandfather. And over there, they had a large, old golden retriever called Hanako. Since the dog was rather friendly, he often pushed Keiki and Mizuha to the ground playfully. At that time, Keiki's grandfather told him the way to calm Hanako down. And once he used that method, Hanako calmed down immediately. He tried remembering his grandfather's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh Keiki, you're still acting as Hanako's pillow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Help me instead of watching. She's heavy, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you give up so easily? You're a man after all, so fight!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible. Hanako is so much bigger than me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha ha. Then, this old man will teach you a secret technique so that you won't lose to Hanako anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A secret technique…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her butt! Pat her on the butt and she'll calm down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Her butt? Really~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, just try it. Touch her butt, my grandson!" -That's right. The butt!</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving out this weird image of his grandfather, he squeezed out the information that he needed: The fact that tails are the weak point for a lot of dogs. Knowing that, you could even calm down the largest of dogs. It might seem a bit ridiculous, but Keiki had no other option as of now.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll patting Senpai on the butt!</p>
<p class="null-p">Keeping his grandfather's words in his heart, he reached out with both of his hands towards Sayuki's behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki let out a cute "Hyan?!" when he grabbed her butt over her shorts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-kun?! Hey, where are you touching-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Screaming won't make me stop!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyauu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, Keiki started his counterattack. Every time he moved his hands, Sayuki raised her voice in a cute manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Woah… Sayuki-senpai's butt… it's so… incredible…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Not even her breasts, but also her butt was dynamite. If she wanted to, she could use this weapon to make every man her plaything.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to taste this butt even more- Keiki started thinking that in his head, as he intensified his grip on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?! Ha…… Nnn……!" With a bright red face, she tried her best to keep her voice down. "Hauuu… N-No more… if you keep going…!" No matter how hard she tried to keep her lips shut, she was unable to do so. "P-Please, s-stop already…!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">And, with no strength left in her legs, she staggered and sat down on the ground. Having been freed from her boob-press, Keiki sighed in relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm saved…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He barely managed to get through it. Grabbing her on the butt really was the right choice. Sayuki for her part still wasn't moving. Although you couldn't read her expression, her shoulders were slightly trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Even though I told you to stop…… even though I begged you to stop… you still……" Her trembling lips once more opened. "Being treated like this… I… I -- I got so excited……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, her previous attitude disappeared completely - instead, she had a beaming smile on her face with expectant eyes as she looked at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu… for me to be stimulated this much by having my butt grabbed - Keiki-kun really is the best. I can't think of anyone other than you who I want to be my master now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why does it end up like this?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what you would expect from a hardcore masochistic female molester. Grabbing her butt did indeed calm her down, but as a side product, Sayuki's wish to make Keiki her master only grew stronger. For her, Keiki's sexual harassment was more of a reward than a punishment. Once more Keiki realized that Sayuki was a pervert through and through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… I'll go home for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's self-explanatory. Having my butt grabbed like this, I can't look Keiki-kun in the eyes anymore because I'm so embarrassed," Saying that in a cute voice, Sayuki turned around with a bright red face, leaving these words behind as she ran away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hey, Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without receiving a response, Keiki only watched the girl's back as it disappeared from the riverbank.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'…Dogs get jealous when their owners are friendly with other dogs,' huh?" He repeated the words Sayuki had said to him. "So because I'm on close terms with Fujimoto-san, she's jealous?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After they had left the school grounds earlier, Sayuki was glaring at Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe that gaze meant something like "Don't get any closer to my master." And maybe she joined this volunteer work to monitor both of them, to make sure that Keiki wouldn't get 'stolen' by another dog.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, Sayuki-senpai isn't a dog after all, and I'm not her owner."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it didn't exactly feel bad to Keiki. Although it wasn't exactly love she was feeling for him, he was still quite happy about it. Boys really are simple beings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Kiryuu-kun? Where's Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… There was a bit of an accident and she ended up going home for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Then, let's do her work with just the two of us."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, the two of them cleaned up the place that Sayuki was supposed to.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without muttering a single complaint, Ayano just continued to pick up trash. Keiki looked at her with a sidelong glance. She really was working herself too hard in place of the people they were lacking. But so was Keiki, making him build up quite the sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun. It's gotten pretty late, so let's call it a day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. The sun's about to set."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as he had stated, the sky was illuminated with a bright red. Making that decision, they started to get ready to return to school. As Keiki looked over the riverbank, he spotted another object that shouldn't belong there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, there's trash even over here…… eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the boundary between river and riverbank, there was a magazine with a naked woman on the cover - a porn magazine. Although he didn't like the idea of it, he couldn't just leave it there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, it's better for Fujimoto-san if you don't come along."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……" Spotting the magazine, Ayano showed a soft smile. "Sorry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu-kun is a boy after all. Akino-san completely understands."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm, aren't you misunderstanding something here? You're wrong, okay?</p>
<p class="null-p">That isn't mine, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, Yup. I understand. I'll go on ahead, so please take your time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so considerate?! I told you! Wait, you're really wrong about this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without answering, she turned on her heel and started walking away. Maybe it was because she was hurrying, or maybe because of the weight of the plastic bag she was holding -- the girl lost her balance for a second.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H--Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she let out this dumbfounded voice, she splendidly fell into the river.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, are you okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah… somehow."</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, the river wasn't all that deep, so all that happened to her was that she got completely soaked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, you fall down quite frequently, don't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu… how shameful."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki stretched out his hand with an astonished expression, he pulled her up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because she was drenched from falling in the river, you could see right through her shirt all the way to her underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noticing Keiki's gaze, she hurriedly hid her breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow…… sorry. Here, we wouldn't want you to catch a cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't just leave her in her wet clothing like this, which is why Keiki draped his jersey over the girl's shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She pulled the jersey over her shoulders towards her neck and hid her lower face with it. Maybe to hide her flushed cheeks? Keiki really couldn't read anything from her mouth, but he thought that her eyes looked really happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, he thought that she looked really cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">…So Fujimoto-san is Cinderella after all?</p>
<p class="null-p">That expression of hers, which looked like a young maiden in love, wouldn't leave Keiki's mind for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, he sent the drenched girl home, brought the filled garbage bags back to school, and told the student council that they couldn't finish everything because two of their members had gone home. It was a lot of trouble - but Keiki thought that it was worth it after seeing that smile on that girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day. After the 4th period gym class had ended, it was time for a well-deserved lunch break. Keiki and Shouma left the gym hall together and went to buy some canned juice from the vending machine. Both of their t-shirts under their jerseys were drenched with sweat, and they very much felt their need for hydration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today's badminton really was tough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, we were working up quite the sweat. Nanjou is bound to use that as some more material if she was watching."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Material?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's better if you don't know. There are some things that are better left unknown in this world."</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't even want to think about what kind of devilish scenarios his BL drawing classmate would produce.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Keiki, at the moment you're investigating Fujimoto-san, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. There's no real reason that it couldn't have been someone from outside the club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be right. So, how's it looking with her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…To be frank, she seems fishy."</p>
<p class="null-p">The day Keiki found the love letter, Ayano was walking around the clubroom building.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she was staring at that locker inside the clubroom……</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was fairly sure that the girl who put the love letter on the table was present when Keiki found it. So there's a possibility that the girl was hiding in the locker during that time. And since they only put some of Sayuki's materials in the locker, they didn't open it very often. However, there was barely enough room to fit in there. Maybe Ayano's gaze went over there naturally because she hid in there?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san seems to be quite fond of Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You think so too, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that he didn't have any definite proof, but her actions had shown more than enough that she seemed to be at least interested in him. Hugging him, clinging to him as he was talking with Sayuki, and hiding her flushed cheeks in his jersey-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Keiki's gotten red. Did something happen with Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… a bit…" Remembering the expression he saw at the riverbank made his heart thump.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was dwelling in his memories, he heard the voice of said girl and lifted up his head. She was carrying music workbooks in her hands, and it looked like her class was moving classrooms. Normally, she'd walk over to him as soon as she saw him, but that wasn't the case now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, she was staying at a safe distance without no intention of coming closer. And, the eye that wasn't hidden with her bangs was just staring at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">She gulped once, as if she was nervous because of something. Seeing that, Keiki tilted his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?! S-Sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki raised his voice, her shoulders twitched and she walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…She's gone. What happened to her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it because you're reeking of sweat?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, now that you say it."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was, after all, still sweaty from gym class. Even his hair was still wet. Fujimoto-san was a girl after all. There's no way she'd approach a boy that was in this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go wipe off the sweat and change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki drank the rest of his drink. After he threw the empty can away, the both of them entered the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, after classes. Keiki was on his way to the student council office after having been called there by Ayano. Full of tension, he knocked on the door, and after receiving an answer, he opened the door. Inside the room, only Ayano was present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sit here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the student council office, there was a small reception area with a sofa on which he sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the jersey, you really saved me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">The jersey he received had a nice detergent smell to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a moment. I'll prepare some tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit later, Ayano returned carrying a tray. On top of that tray was a delicious-smelling apple pie and the tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is the pie for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As thanks for lending me your jersey."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me; you baked that too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. I'm rather confident in it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously… it looks like a product from a cake shop."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Want to try?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it would be a waste not to…" He grabbed the fork and took a bite.</p>
<p class="null-p">The flaky dough and the sweet apples were in perfect harmony, making Keiki forget about all his troubles for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa, what is this…? It's so delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that you like it," While Keiki was enjoying the delicious cake, Ayano sat down next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, just as Keiki had expected, she clung to his arm. She rubbed her cheeks against him like she wanted to be spoiled. Although this wasn't the first time she had done that, Keiki couldn't help but get embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Fujimoto-san? It's a bit hard to eat like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not your dominant hand, so it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What if someone were to see us like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nobody will be coming. I asked the others to go home for the day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you misusing your status as the vice president?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't use my status. I told them that I would bring a boy here, and they all wished me good luck with a smile."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That'll definitely cause all sorts of misunderstandings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, they got a good conversation going. Even though Ayano looked like she wasn't the kind of person to talk much, she could actually be quite the open-mouthed girl. Keiki didn't mind talking with her like this, but he did want to bring an end to his farce. He had to know if she really was the Cinderella who dropped her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Ah, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You kept quiet for so long. Do… Do you dislike being like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't. On the contrary, I'm quite happy to have a girl next to me like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, it's a give-and-take… right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm also happy that I can be next to Kiryuu-kun like this," Combined with her smile, that phrase made Keiki's heart beat incredibly fast.</p>
<p class="null-p">It made him hope that his girl was actually his Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, say -- huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to question her, but his wish wasn't granted. Next to him, he could hear the soft breathing of Ayano, who seemed to have fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She really fell asleep…… shouldn't you be a bit more careful?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was still a boy. And boys could turn into wolves from time to time. Even though she was together with a potential wolf, she fell asleep safe and sound. She really shouldn't complain if she were to get eaten in this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I really don't get her sometimes, but she sure is a cute girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Deciding that he could pause the Cinderella investigation for a bit, he continued to look at her cute sleeping face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wha?! Aren't I acting like a complete normie?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">To outsiders, the two of them must've looked like lovers for sure. It was a situation that Keiki had always yearned for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like this really is the best…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wanting to become his pet, wanting to make him a slave, wanting him to stay as a model for the BL manga. All these abnormal requests - Keiki couldn't say yes to them. All Keiki wanted was to spend time with his loved one, just like now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuwaa… it seems like I'm also getting sleepy…" After that exhausting gym class, his body started to get heavy. "It should be fine for just a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this calming atmosphere, inside the quiet student council office, Keiki closed his eyes. And like this, he also fell asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">……………………………</p>
<p class="null-p">……………………………</p>
<p class="null-p">……………………………</p>
<p class="null-p">And quite some time passed. As he heard a metallic sound, his consciousness returned from the depths of his sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's that sound…? And why do I feel a breeze around my legs?</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened his eyes, the sun was already about to go down, illuminating the student council office. And at first he couldn't believe the scene before his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was still sitting on the couch, Keiki's pants had been lowered down. Ayano's face was right in front of the place that a boy like him had to protect at all costs, and she was looking straight at it and reaching for his underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought that he was still dreaming. But the coldness that he felt from his legs and the uneasiness in his heart proved him wrong, and he understood that this was really happening in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwwwwwwwwaaaaaa?! W-W-W-What are you doing?!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Ah, what a shame. You woke up," The girl muttered with her usual calm attitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the moment that Fujimoto Ayano had shown her real self.</p>
<p class="null-p">With his pants pulled down, Keiki protected his chastity as the girl tried to pull down his underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san! Why are you doing this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I, Fujimoto Ayano, get aroused by smells, especially from a guy's body odour. Recently, I couldn't stop smelling Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, what kind of joke is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm completely serious. It's called olfactophilia. So please give me your underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm starting to lose count how many times this has happened!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto Akino was a pervert all along. And she was a completely different kind of pervert than the members of the calligraphy club. "If you want to, we can trade our underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No! Just how much do you want my briefs, really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew that a lot of men would be happy to receive the panties of a girl, but he didn't expect that there would be a girl who would literally pull down a guy's pants to get to his underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you saved me, I understood that this was my destined smell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That kind of destiny can rot in hell!"</p>
<p class="null-p">So she had been snuggling up against him to get a better whiff of his smell.</p>
<p class="null-p">And every time after he had saved her, she came closer to smell him again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really is a shame. Even though I put narcotics into the cake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Narcotics!? So that's why I felt so sleepy?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably also put them in the tea she presented him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? But Fujimoto-san fell asleep before me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That wasn't supposed to happen. Kiryuu-kun's smell calmed me down so much that I happened to fall asleep myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">And before she could pull off her plan, Keiki happened to wake up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I was actually in quite the crisis…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he really could, he'd like to avoid having his most precious jewels seen by such a perverted girl like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu… I was aiming for your after-sport briefs. I wanted to get a good sniff of a boy's sweat-drenched briefs……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaa…" Her words sent a shiver up his spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had thought that he would finally get a cute girlfriend. But Keiki did not at all expect this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, if you really have olfactophilia, why did you run away during lunch break?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… the smell was just about to overwhelm me. If I'd gotten any closer, I wouldn't have been able to hold myself back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that explains a lot." It seemed like she was also trying to hide her fetish. "So was that why you rubbed my jersey against your face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. Even after I went home, I couldn't stop smelling on your jersey. Since you were working up quite the sweat while you were working, it really was the best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">So her cheeks were red only because she was aroused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why did you stare at the locker inside the calligraphy club room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lockers always hold a treasurous smell. When a boy has finished changing after gym class, he wipes the sweat off with a small towel. That gives a boy's locker a very special charm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was the worst reason imaginable!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's also the reason why I like inspecting the other clubs. Especially the sports clubs. When I enter their rooms, the boys' smell is all over the place. It makes me so excited. It's the best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like a clubroom is a sauna!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki completely gave up on everything. It must've been a complete coincidence that Ayano was in the club room building that day when he found the love letter. It seemed like his wish for a normal romance was unattainably far away, and it only moved further away the closer he tried to get.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, please give me your briefs, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is this school really going to be fine with a vice president like her?</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing Keiki knew for sure was that Ayano wasn't Cinderella. </p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: Love, Stalkers And Other Delusions</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the fast food restaurant near the school, there were three people sitting near a window.</p>
<p class="null-p">A completely boring boy, Kiryuu Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">An ikemen with a soft smile, Akiyama Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">And a small girl with her hair in a pigtail, Ootori Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was after school. After Shouma's club activities ended, they met up and entered the restaurant. Shouma, hungry from club activities, ordered a burger set, the girl with the small stomach ordered her usual fries, and Keiki chose a platter of chicken nuggets. Shouma was seated at the window side with Koharu next to him while Keiki was seated across the table. In order to hide her ribbon from Shouma, Koharu had her hoodie zipped all the way up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And about the third playoff for the olympics-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was a heated battle, yes. I was so moved to see that they took a medal for Japan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their conversations ranged from topics about tennis, to the stuff that happened at school, to other topics without major importance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is there even any reason for me to be here…? - thought Keiki as he chewed on a chicken nugget.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two people across the table were happily talking without paying him any attention. But Koharu had asked Keiki to come here with her. Being alone with the boy she loved all of a sudden was a hurdle that she didn't seem to be able to jump yet. Keiki completely understood her feelings, and had accepted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akiyama-senpai, you have some sauce on your cheek."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stay still for a second." Koharu wiped away the sauce with a napkin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Any male would interpret that action as a forceful approach. And to Keiki's surprise, Shouma actually got a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki, who had been burned yet again by a Cinderella candidate who turned out a pervert, could only see this scene the same way as any other girlfriend-less virgin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fucking normies should just explode!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or rather… They're completely forgetting about me, aren't they?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was still happy that they had managed to get this close in this short amount of time, though. Once Koharu deems that her love is finally fulfilled,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki will be released from his role as her cupid and gain freedom once more. However, that hadn't turned out to be such a simple venture as Keiki had wished it to be. After all, Akiyama Shouma is a lolicon, and Ootori Koharu isn't actually his Kouhai, but rather his Senpai.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why they had to take drastic measures: Hiding the ribbon that indicated her year.</p>
<p class="null-p">And even now, Koharu's beloved one was not aware of the fact that she was older than him.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes ended, there were two figures inside the year 2B classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">A completely normal boy: Kiryuu Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">And a rather flashy-clothed brownish-red-haired classmate of his, who wore her hair in a sidetail: Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">What were they doing? While our prince was sitting on a chair, Mao was making sketches of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once homeroom class had ended, he was requested to become her model.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki for his part was forced to agree.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, here is an excerpt from that conversation:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kiryuu. Do you have some time after this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really have anything to do today, no."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted some new material for my new release, so would you model for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I absolutely refuse."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't help me, our precious Keeki might have some strong men assault him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since that Keeki-kun doesn't have any relation to me, I couldn't care less."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I were to share that work with all our female classmates?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you a demon?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that, Keiki had no other option but to agree.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, he was alone with a girl inside this quiet classroom. Normally, situations like these would have the potential to turn into a sweet page in the story of his still ongoing adolescence. Instead, he was stuck watching the evil witch in front of him as she furiously illustrated her BL manga. That being said, from the outside Mao was still quite the beauty to behold. Her long eyelashes, her plump-looking lips, her pure white neck… every time she entered his gaze, he saw her as the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki obediently stayed still as a model, the girl's hands suddenly came to a stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you done?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the front, yeah. Though I'd really like some variations."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… what should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you start stripping?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no meaning to this if you don't strip."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like, the upper half of my body?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about? - Completely naked of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are YOU saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch, still no good, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Stripping right here in this classroom would make me a pervert after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess there's no helping it. Then can you turn to the side? I want to draw your profile."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Quite some more time passed in silence after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, Nanjou?" Keiki asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, wouldn't a picture be enough for this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would work, yeah, but it looks better when I draw it in person. And drawing live subjects is also good practice. It really helps me draw a lot better overall."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that your drawing skills are really good already, though," Keiki said. "There's no limit when it comes to skill. And it can never hurt to keep the basics fresh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like I'm using this as an excuse to be alone together with you or anything, so please don't misunderstand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who would even begin to have such a misunderstanding?" Keiki muttered, which earned him a glare from Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">What…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Being a normal high school boy with no romantic experience, Keiki didn't understand girls at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, don't you need Shouma's sketches too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhmmm, nope. It's pretty easy to draw an ikemen like him. Drawing people with a normal face like Kiryuu is much harder."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A normal face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about being thankful that it's not an ugly face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've ever heard a follow-up like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Should you really say all that to the person who's being kind enough to model for you…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, regarding BL manga, I'm actually really grateful for it. Pairing up two ikemen isn't interesting at all, and since Keeki is part of the story, it makes the ikemen Shouto stand out even more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Keeki-kun's only reason for existence is to make Shouto look even better, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you want to be born as an ikemen, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I certainly wouldn't have complained."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure that you don't understand the feeling." "Why's that?" Nanjou asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're quite the beauty already, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything stopped. Both time and Mao's pencil.</p>
<p class="null-p">With slightly flushed cheeks, she narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu really is an idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why? Is being insulted my reward for complimenting you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a deep breath, Mao returned to her work. And a certain person didn't notice that her lips had started shaking slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I guess I can draw you a bit more cool-looking in my next work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. I can't bring myself to be happy about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you know, BL isn't just about pairing up boys."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What brought up that sudden change of topic?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't have the slightest bit of interest in the intricacies of BL. But seeing how Mao had started talking again with a happy look on her face, Keiki honestly thought that she looked cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face when she talks about something she likes is really great… though the content of her story clearly isn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">If only this conversation wasn't about BL, she would look even more charming. He really didn't want to know more about how a deep, passionate kiss between two boys was the best thing ever for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's beautiful, she's a tsundere, she can be really sweet sometimes, and her smiling face is so cute it's actually unfair. But her whole world revolves around BL manga. It really is a shame. Even a slight imperfection like that can completely ruin a person's image, and she was the perfect example of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a girl that Akiyama is quite close with, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll take that silence as a yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever are you talking about? I don't know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to lie. I saw it after all. While you were gleefully eating together in that restaurant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you saw that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's the perfect girlfriend for a lolicon. Are they going out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had told Keiki that she would try to obstruct any relationship between him and another girl. If Keiki went out with a girl, he would spend less time with Shouma, which would reduce her material for her BL manga. Though that should be the same if Shouma started going out with a girl, too. Once it got out that Shouma and Koharu were in item, she might become a hindrance. And if that were to happen, Keiki would have failed his job as Koharu's cupid, and she surely would release that dangerous photo she had of him and Sayuki. The photo of them being a little too close with each other. If that made its way online, it would completely destroy his social life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, Keiki came to a conclusion: He had to deceive Mao right here or it would all be over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, I don't think that they're going out. They're both just happy to have someone else they can talk to about tennis."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? ……And what about you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Besides the club president and Yuika, you've been awfully close with the vice president of the student council lately, haven't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So are you going out with Fujimoto Ayano?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm not. I really am not."</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto Ayano wasn't Cinderella. Instead, she was just a person who gets aroused by smells. Keiki considered his being forced to drink sleeping pills just because she wanted his underwear to be completely unacceptable. She was only interested in him because she had gotten aroused by his scent. There were no romantic feelings involved at all. But Mao must've interpreted Ayano's closeness to Keiki as them being lovey-dovey.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Well, just as I told you before, being close with guys is good, but girls aren't allowed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, I know…Though I don't know why you have to go that far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really~? If you say that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao stood up from her seat, walked over to Keiki's side, and sat down once more. Not on a chair but on his lap. Facing towards him, like she was mounting him. And if that weren't enough already, she put her hands around his neck. Suddenly finding himself in a position like he was glued to Mao, Keiki in his confusion thought that they must look like a couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, finding himself close enough to kiss Mao, Keiki gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Uhm… Nanjou-san? What is the meaning of this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is all for my data. I want to see Keeki's embarrassed expression for when Shouto pushes him into a corner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. So don't avert your eyes, okay?" With these words, Mao leaned in even closer, her face nearly touching Keiki's.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it was her perfume, but a sweet smell assaulted Keiki's brain cells. Even though he knew that she was just acting, his heartbeat wouldn't slow down. It really looked like she was going in for a kiss-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki gave in and closed his eyes.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, I told you not to look away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it was because she was a bit angry with him, but Mao pinched his nose. When he opened his eyes, Mao looked amused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu. Did you really think… that I would kiss you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, that's not…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm glad that you reacted this way. Yup. That feels just like Keeki. I feel like I can draw a good manuscript after this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm glad that I could be of help."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Keiki say these words, Mao let out a cheerful giggle. In the next moment, she packed up her materials, stuffed her notebook into her bag, and turned around with an "Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for today, Kiryuu. This is your reward."</p>
<p class="null-p">Blowing him a kiss, she left the classroom happily. She would probably go straight home and work on her manuscript.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That really surprised me. I really thought that she was going to kiss me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Mao's watery eyes and flushed cheeks had completely robbed Keiki of his ability to think. Her face had an expression like she really was in love with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Acting like that with a boy she doesn't even have any feelings for… Mao sure must love her BL manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how much did she want to get some new BL material, really…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Sadly, the boy did not know that the girl herself was right outside the door, furiously blushing from reaching her limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, Keiki and Koharu were standing in front of the school gate after classes. Today's agenda was an after school date. Today was a day when a certain boy had no tennis club activities. Their goal for today was deepening the relationship between Koharu and said boy: Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being alone with her beloved one would still be too much of a hurdle for Koharu as of now, which is why they had decided on a double date. Even so…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai, are you nervous?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Would you believe me if I said I wasn't?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all, no. Even your voice is shaking slightly. Relax, relax."</p>
<p class="null-p">While they were waiting, the third person arrived: A black-haired female student. The ribbon on her uniform indicated her year. Blue, to be precise, which meant that she was third-year. Every step the girl took, her long black hair and big breasts shook. The big-breasted girl's name was Tokihara Sayuki. She was the club president of the calligraphy club, and many people saw her as a beautiful Onee-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I made you wait?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason that Keiki had invited Sayuki was simple: Her big breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Keiki had invited Yuika, the lolicon (Shouma) might've stared at her tiny breasts. Big breasts are the natural enemy of a lolicon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really happy that you invited me. I haven't been on a date with Keikikun since we went to that cafe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We aren't alone this time, though," Keiki said, indicating the hoodiewearing girl behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, seeing that person, Sayuki raised her voice in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, if it isn't Ootori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know her, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We were in the same class our first year. Why does Keiki-kun know her…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah?! D-Don't tell me, Keiki-kun is a lolicon-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that there would be four people participating, but is Ootori-san possibly aiming for Keiki-kun too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Kiryuu-kun isn't my target. Not to mention that he isn't even my type."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes sense. He really doesn't have a lot of impact."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. I would prefer someone who had a more promising future as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… Both of you… Are you having fun teasing your Kouhai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, we're just joking. Keiki-kun has some good points too, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's right. I think that Kiryuu-kun is a good person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you put it that way, it sounds less like I'm a good person and more like I'm a person who doesn't matter, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He recalled reading an article online titled 'Girls really are scary'.</p>
<p class="null-p">While the two of them were still teasing him, Shouma ran up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, sorry for being late. Cleaning duty took a bit longer than expected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We didn't wait at all, Akiyama-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that phrase, Sayuki tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akiyama-senpai…? Eh, but, Ootori-san is a third- Mguh?!" Keiki quickly covered her mouth before she could speak the forbidden words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he was a bit taken aback by the softness of her lips, he couldn't allow her to speak any further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Keiki?" Shouma asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing! Sayuki-senpai was about to say some stupid joke so I stopped her beforehand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? You two really are close."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki easily deceived him. The only thing Shouma was lacking in life was a straightforward friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, since that's all of us, let's get going."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, let's."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma and Koharu started walking through the school gate, and Keiki and Sayuki followed suit, but a bit slower. Keiki still had his hand over Sayuki's mouth, and her cheeks were slightly flushed. When he was certain that they were far enough away that Shouma couldn't hear him, he let go of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To suddenly silence a girl like this… how rude. But that's what makes Keiki so wonderful. Would you become my master?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I refuse."</p>
<p class="null-p">She still was the same masochistic pervert as always. It seems like she actually enjoyed that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But still, why does Ootori-san call Akiyama-kun 'Senpai?'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are some extenuating circumstances. She became a first-year for this occasion."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't get it, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He explained the situation to her in a quiet voice, including Shouma's lolicon tendencies and their plan to hook him up with Koharu anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, Akiyama-kun thinks that Ootori-san is his Kouhai. She's trying to hide the fact that she's older than him because Akiyama-kun is a lolicon. That makes sense, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's how it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. I'll keep quiet in front of Akiyama-kun. Though I would like some Thai yakiniku as my payment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for your patronage."</p>
<p class="null-p">Grilled meat barbecue was a small price to pay in order to protect a maiden in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And now I understand why you invited me and not Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for using you, Sayuki-senpai…… You're not angry, are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the type of girl who gets happy when you're using me like this. It's more of a reward for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But what about Nanjou-san? Couldn't you have invited her instead?" "Well, Nanjou might've been even more dangerous than Yuika in a sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, she would try her best to drive a nail between Shouma and Koharu. But that probably would happen soon enough anyway, Keiki imagined. It was only a matter of time. And that wasn't the only problem. Koharu probably wouldn't be able to keep her age a secret from Shouma for much longer. "That's why I'm trying to bring them together as close as possible before that secret comes out."</p>
<p class="null-p">If he managed to do that, Shouma might reconsider his stance on legal lolis and accept Koharu. The hope is that he would be close enough not to reject her like he had rejected every other girl who had confessed to him. And today's date was the most important part of Keiki's plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place the four of them were walking towards to was a bowling alley near the train station.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't get a chance to tell you this before, but this is my first time bowling."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a shocking confession. Have you really never bowled before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mean to brag, but I'm really not athletic at all. To be honest, I really hate sports. Whenever any girls in my class invite me to play, I always make up some excuse."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whoah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Bad at cleaning, bad at sports… even Sayuki has some weak points it seems. Though that all gets blown away when she's seriously working on her calligraphy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? But why did you accept my invite today of all times?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… uhm, Keiki-kun invited me after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Does that mean-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Sayuki look up at him with expectant eyes, Keiki couldn't help but anticipate some kind of lovey-dovey response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If the master says so, a dog would even start a fight with a bear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're comparing bowling to fighting bears now? And I'm not your master, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">That sweet expectant feeling disappeared immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">How many times does that make?</p>
<p class="null-p">After everyone arrived at the bowling alley, they each borrowed a pair of shoes, selected a bowling ball, and prepared for the round to start. Keiki and Sayuki paired up on one side of the bowling lane, with Shouma and Koharu paired up and sat across from them. As the game started, Sayuki proposed a competition.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Playing normally wouldn't be too much fun, so how we punish the person who gets last place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that sounds like fun, but is it alright with you? Sayuki-senpai, this is your first time playing, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. As long as I win, everything is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person… she's just raising flags on her own…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep, it seems like the end result is already written in stone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Sayuki's groundless self-confidence, the boys nodded to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I wonder about that. It's true that I'm a complete nut when it comes to sports, but this time there's also Ootori-san to consider!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-san can't possibly be good at bowling. Can you even hold a bowling ball with that body of yours?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to worry. There are some light ones too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she looked like a child, she was acting like an adult, and wasn't responding to Sayuki's obvious provocation. Noticing that, Keiki wondered if they really were the same age.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, what will be the punishment, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about the person in first place has the right to write anything on the face of the person in last place? An embarrassing nickname or something. And removing it on the way home is not allowed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds like a pain…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And in addition, the person in first place has the right to give the person in third place an order."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that worse than being in last place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's body shivered for a second, imagining the outcome if Sayuki happened to get first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine with it, but what about Koharu-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sounds interesting, so I'm in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like it's decided then."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, everyone agreed to the punishment game and the bowling game started, but with an unpredictable development.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Another strike! You're amazing, Koharu-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, you're awesome, Ootori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This can't be happening…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To everyone's surprise, Koharu was in first place right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My father likes to bowl, so I've often gone bowling with my family."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes sense, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How could this happen…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being confronted with this unexpected obstacle, Sayuki's face completely tensed up. Even though Keiki had taught her the basics, her non-existent athletic skills shone through and it was becoming increasingly impossible for her to avert the upcoming punishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But just as you'd expect from Shouma. He doesn't show any interest at all in Sayuki-senpai's breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">Everytime she threw the bowling ball, her breasts swayed furiously. It was like they had their own gravitational pull, and no normal adolescent boy would be able to avert his eyes. However, Shouma only kept his eyes on Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Koharu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said that you were weak to sunlight, right? Aren't you getting hot in your hoodie in here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Shouma said so with no ill-intent at all, Koharu started panicking, while Keiki couldn't think of anything to say. Though from Shouma's perspective, it was a reasonable enough question. In this dire situation, Koharu came up with an excuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, well, i-it's embarrassing since my breasts are so tiny……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guha?!" Hearing Koharu's reply, Shouma let out a scream as if he was shot in the chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, Shouma looked like a buddhist who had reached enlightenment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you hear that, Keiki? Koharu's cutesy phrase."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did, I did. Everyone has their own problems, so let's leave it alone for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not only did she dispel the dire situation, she also increased her affection points with Shouma. Ootori Koharu-what a dangerous woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Akiyama-kun really is a pervert through and through."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He still wouldn't lose to Sayuki-senpai though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even a lolicon would lose against a hardcore masochistic woman who wishes to be owned by a master.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I didn't expect Shouma to be worse than me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I was always pretty bad at bowling, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you want me to teach you a thing or two?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then I'll gladly accept."</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that, Koharu started teaching Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ooh, that's a nice atmosphere they've got there.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like they were getting even closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though in that moment, Keiki thought he saw a small glimmer coming from Koharu's bag. As he looked closer, he saw a small camera with the lens taken off, but Keiki pretended like he didn't notice. "That's gotta be a video she's taking…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was once more reminded of Koharu's real nature. Even now, he couldn't forget the creeped-out feeling he had when he first saw the interior of the astronomy club room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it really okay for this love to bear fruit…?" The cupid muttered as he watched the two of them laughing together.</p>
<p class="null-p">And he felt the weight of his sin. He had sold out his friend to a stalker girl just because of one photo that could completely demolish his social life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it's not like Ootori-senpai is a bad girl or anything, she just comes on too strong…</p>
<p class="null-p">And like that, the game ended. Unlike what everyone had expected, Koharu was at the top of the leaderboard, and Sayuki was at rock bottom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And third place is Shouma, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Well, it makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Koharu had taught him a trick or two, it was still impossible to improve enough in one day to beat Keiki. The person in last place gets something written on her head, while the person in third place has to obey an order from the person in first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, winner Koharu, your order for Shouma, if you will."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't make it hurt too much, Koharu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no need to hold back. A harsh demand from a loser is the best." "Now now, Sayuki-senpai. People in last place should keep quiet."</p>
<p class="null-p">The tiny, hoodie-wearing girl made fists with her hands, mustering up her courage to give out the order.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, from now on, can I call Akiyama-senpai… Shouma-kun…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guhaaaa?!" The ikemen once more got shot in the chest by that cute order.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems like that phrase coming out from a loli had too much impact on the lolicon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Keiki," Shouma said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I can die peacefully now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then die for all I care."</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that, it was decided that Koharu would start calling Shouma 'Shouma-kun'. Since they had gotten quite a bit closer, Keiki decided to call this double date a success.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Koharu wrote 'My breasts are too big' on Sayuki's cheek as punishment. This was probably even more embarrassing than a nickname, especially because a lot of people would see her on the way back. Though Keiki thought that she deserved it, he received a email from Sayuki on the way home.</p>
<p class="null-p">'On the way home, everyone looked at me with erotic eyes. It was the best.' "This isn't even punishment anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, this was just another reward for this masochistic female molester.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes, Keiki was called to the 'horror house.' It was the place where both the walls and even the ceiling were covered in photos of Akiyama Shouma. Namely, it was the astronomy clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't there even more photos than before…?" Keiki muttered as he entered the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's your imagination," answered Koharu with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm pretty sure that they've gone up in number…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Koharu's 'Akiyama collection' was going to grow even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't the other club members against all of this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"All the other members are ghost members. And the advisor is too laid back to even bother coming here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, so nobody is here to stop it, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu could do as she pleased with that room. Deciding to set that aside for now, Keiki sat down at the table, facing Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai, what are you doing with that video camera?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm looking at the video I took at the bowling center."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, so you really were filming that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've been able to take a video so up-close with Shoumakun. I watched it on loop all night long."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that you're living your life to the fullest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Getting closer to Shouma-kun… Being able to record his voice from up close like this… It feels like I always have him by my side, even when I'm at home. It's even become a routine for me to listen to his voice every time I go to bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better make sure that Shouma never hears anything of this."</p>
<p class="null-p">That would probably destroy everything they had built up until now. Even if she looks like a maiden in love, she still is a stalker deep inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, did something good happen, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe, is it that obvious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, you look really happy right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually… Shouma-kun invited me to go out with him on the next day we have no school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, now that's good news."</p>
<p class="null-p">Definite forward progress. Keiki the cupid was very happy to hear this news.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lately, we've been exchanging emails in the evening, and talking with each other on the phone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm happy to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">They sounded even more like a couple right now. Shouma had also started calling Koharu 'Koharu-chan'. It seemed like Koharu was really giving it her best even without having Keiki around. At this rate, she might not even need his support anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he started to feel lonely for some reason, Keiki once more looked around the astronomy club room. The curtains were open, and the early-summer sunlight entered the room. The light danced across the surface of the room's large telescope and binoculars. Several different types of cameras lay on a table next to the wall outside the sunlight's reach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a crazy number of cameras. Do they all belong to the astronomy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, most of them belong to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They belong to you… aren't they pretty expensive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to worry. It may not look like it, but I'm the daughter of a company president."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? The daughter of a company president?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you familiar with Ootori Construction?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I have seen some commercials, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her way of eating fast food looked very noble, and her movements looked very refined, but Keiki didn't expect her to be from such an important family.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you're so tiny, Ootori-senpai really has a lot going for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't feel like that's a compliment…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she looked aggravated for a moment, her lips loosened into a lovable smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Shouma-kun's a lolicon, I never would've been able to get closer to him if I didn't hide my ribbon," She softly touched the ribbon on her chest. "It's all thanks to Kiryuu-kun. Being this close to my loved one has made me more happy than I could have ever dreamed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling slightly embarrassed, Keiki scratched his cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't really do anything… I did only help you so that you would delete that photo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that photo. I deleted that the day you promised to help me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? W-Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that Kiryuu-kun seemed like the kind of person who would keep his promises. After all, you're Shouma-kun's dear friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">So Koharu had trusted Keiki from the very beginning. Hearing that, he felt a warm, fuzzy feeling inside his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I won't rely on Kiryuu-kun anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have prepared myself. Today, I'm wearing pink underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pink underwear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a popular good luck charm with women. When they wear pink underwear on the day they want to confess to the boy they love, it will bring them success."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I never knew such a charm existed."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the first time Keiki had ever heard of that, but he knew that girls had a lot of these superstitions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh? But if you're wearing that today, then-" Hearing Keiki's words, Koharu nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I've finally raised enough courage. I'm done with the cute little Koharu act."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will confess my feelings to Shouma-kun, as the real me."</p>
<p class="null-p">And to Keiki, it looked like her eyes were shining with courage. "-Koharu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No more threatening me with pictures, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't! …But, huh? Did you just call me Koharu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ootori Koharu had made up her mind. Now there was only one thing that Keiki could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give it your best, please. I'm cheering for you, Koharu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Yes, I'll do my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">He could only see her off, hoping that her feelings would reach Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">After waiting until Shouma's tennis practice was over, Koharu started the operation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Koharu-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun. Can we walk home together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having no explicit reason to decline, the both of them started walking home next to each other. Koharu, who had made up her mind to confess to the boy, had slightly flushed cheeks and continuously glanced at Shouma. Having no idea what would happen, the boy just continued to talk with Koharu about whatever came to mind. And there was one person who followed them, watching this adolescent scene with his own eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow, I feel like a stalker now…" muttered Kiryuu Keiki in astonishment. "Koharu-senpai said that she would be fine, but I'm still kind of worried…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without being aware of the cupid following them, the two of them continued to walk. The street they walked on was just like any other, and it was illuminated by the slowly setting sun. They passed traffic lights as they walked, with seemingly a bubble around them deflecting the people passing them by. The scenery started to change the more they kept walking. And after about 10 minutes had passed since they left school… In an alley with trees on both sides, Koharu stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan? What's wrong?" Shouma asked as he turned around. He received no answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the green trees with sunlight slightly shining through, the girl simply gazed at the boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you remember? One year ago, Shouma-kun and I met at exactly this place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That day, Shouma-kun got me back my hat that blew away in the wind," Saying that, she slowly pulled down the zipper of her hoodie.</p>
<p class="null-p">And along with her white blouse, the ribbon became visible. The moment her blonde ribbon came in sight, the magic that was cast on the girl vanished. Standing there was the girl who was one year older than her loved one. The third-year highschool student Ootori Koharu.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan, that ribbon…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for lying to you. But I wanted to get closer to you no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the place where they had met for the very first time, Koharu turned her feelings into words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we've met, I've always… always - been in love with Shouma-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were the feelings she had kept deep inside her heart, for this whole year. Barely being able to hold them back, she could finally let it all out. She finally built up her courage to confess. Her confession gave off so much force that even Keiki felt the impact.</p>
<p class="null-p">But- the moment he saw Shouma's face, he knew what was going to follow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, Koharu-chan. I'm a lolicon after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were the words he had said every time he turned down a confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't go out with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Shouma, who had been left alone, didn't go home, but instead walked to a nearby park. After sitting down on a deserted bench, he didn't move at all. The setting sun was slowly swallowed up in darkness, and the sky gradually grew darker and darker in hue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the sound of approaching footsteps, he lifted up his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, ladykiller. How's it feel after turning down a cute girl like her?" "Keiki… so you were watching."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Actually, I was Koharu-senpai's cupid all this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see, now I understand," Shouma let out a small laugh, but didn't get angry.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the emotion that Keiki was feeling right now: Anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai was crying…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being rejected, Koharu started crying. As she turned around and ran away, even Keiki was able to tell from a distance. Just how much she was hurt, just how much pain she felt in that moment. Remembering that sight, the depths of Keiki's chest were burning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you know how serious Koharu-senpai was with that confession? Every time she met you, she was crazy nervous. She could never even bring up the nerve to talk with you over this whole year. And now… now that she finally mustered up her courage, you turn her down because 'You're a lolicon'?! Did you really think I could just go home after watching that farce?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew just how happy Koharu was about their first two-person photo together. Just how serious she was about Shouma. As her cupid, he was the closest person to her feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Falling in love with someone… going out with someone… I believe that Shouma is free to decide all of that. But shooting a girl down just because she's a year older than you is just-"</p>
<p class="null-p">So unbelievably cruel towards that tiny Senpai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki really is kind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I remember meeting her, in that alley."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. I thought that she was really cute, which is why I went there countless times after that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That probably made you look really suspicious…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But in the end, I never met her again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, it made sense. After falling for Shouma, she was unable to hold back her feelings and turned into a stalker, always acting in such a way that he would never see her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never realized that that girl was actually Koharu-chan. Her hair was much shorter than now, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Only with a small change in hair length, girls can look completely different. How ironic that he had missed her this whole year because of something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma, why is it that a girl being older than you is no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, I never told you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki sat down next to Shouma, while still glaring straight at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know that I have two older sisters, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Asahi-san and Yuuhi-san. They're at university, if I remember correctly."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki had gone over to play at Shouma's house, he often met them. Though they both had different personalities, it was plain as day that the two of them were both beautiful sisters.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those two are the reason that I turned into a lolicon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They both are serious brocons. And not just in the normal meaning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The normal meaning…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was this particular incident, see? When I was in my first year of middle school, I went to take a bath, and when I entered the bathroom, the two of them were there waiting for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That day was the 14th of February, so Valentine's day. They both decorated their bodies with chocolate and said 'Go ahead and eat me.' This resulted in me collapsing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa… that's harsh."</p>
<p class="null-p">That must've been tough on Shouma's psyche.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But wait, Mizuha wouldn't be so bad, I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki imagined a scene with a chocolate-decorated Mizuha, saying "Eat me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that a reward?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's set your siscon tendencies aside for now. Anyways, they often teased me with stuff like that. Before I realized it, I noticed myself trying to keep my distance from older women. So much so that I turned into a lolicon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, I understand why you turned into a lolicon." His sisters had traumatized him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have no problem when it's with friends, like that time with Tokiharasenpai. But, when it comes to actual relationships, it gets difficult. See that girl who just walked by? She's almost done with her teen growth spurt, and when she's in high school, I probably wouldn't even look at her anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's gotta be the worst coming-out ever…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ikemen was still, regrettably, a lolicon. He still is insisting that girls in their growth spurt, or with nothing at all, are the best. Maybe being a lolicon is an incurable disease. He'll turn any girl down if she is younger than him but is well-developed. He'll turn any girl down if she looks like a loli but is older than him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why are you making such a face, Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What kind of face am I making?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To put it in Mizuha's words, you look like a lost child."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lost child… That might be true. I mean, when I saw Koharu-chan crying, my chest hurt. This is the first time I've ever felt like that when turning a girl down."</p>
<p class="null-p">He probably felt that Koharu was different from any other girl who had confessed to him as of yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You had fun, right? When Koharu-senpai was with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that's because it's Koharu-chan. Not because she looks like a loli." "………I know." His voice was filled with regret.</p>
<p class="null-p">But his next words were even more shocking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know… that I can't keep going like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked down at the ground, and it seemed like he had made up his mind. He was properly thinking of himself and the person in front of him, his expression filled with determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day after school. The astronomy room was once more wrapped in an artificial night, just like the first time Keiki had entered the room. The only thing that illuminated the room was the phone screen that Koharu was looking at, and it showed her first photo together with Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai, you really were here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please answer your phone calls. I was really worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry," Tightly grasping the smartphone to her chest, she once more said "I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though Kiryuu-kun was cheering me on, I was still rejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I saw from the shadows. Koharu-senpai really gave it her all. I think that</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma is the one at fault here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's not…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you think that his reasoning is just ridiculous? He can't go out with you since you're older? What's up with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… might be true," As she recalled the scene, she nodded as she looked like she was about to cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Keiki softly patted his Senpai's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That guy might be a bit good-looking, but his personality is the worst. He always says stuff like 'I don't have any interest in them if they're not small.'" "Well, I really wish he had some delicacy when it came to that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? How can he just go and say 'I'm a lolicon after all' to every girl who musters up all the courage she has? Isn't that too cruel?" "I-I think so! That really hurt me!" The little girl screamed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, the two of them continued to badmouth Akiyama.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't get him, that Shouma! Even older women have a certain charm!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right! I think that an older woman makes an even better wife!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right! And normal boys would do anything to get spoiled by an older woman!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't see why it has to be a girl younger than him!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The girl's gotta have big breasts, after all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, even small breasts have their own charm!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what exactly does he mean by 'lolicon'? Liking young, small girls is totally an out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! Being an actual lolicon is a crime I think!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them continued their heated discussion. And just at that moment…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uhm, can you stop already? Anything further and it will definitely leave permanent damage. It feels like my heart's about to break from that crime talk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shouma-kun?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a hand on his chest, the person in question entered the room. Realizing that, Koharu hurriedly stood up and started panicking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Uhm, I-I was just lost in the moment… I didn't mean to badmouth</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma-kun at all, I just had to vent some stress from yesterday…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai, your facade is breaking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, am I done for?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Koharu was panicking, the ikemen stepped forward. He softly took her hand, which left her in complete speechless confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During the time I spent with Koharu-chan, I had so much fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really thought that I might be fine if it's Koharu-chan… but I might need some rehabilitation for that. That's why I would like to ask Koharu-chan for help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, basically…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, uhm… can we start as friends?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that Koharu had entered Shouma's heart, but he wasn't able to immediately overcome his lolicon nature, which is why he decided to slowly grow accustomed to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the first time the young boy had ever reacted like this after a confession. It was something like a confession of his own.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the girl in front of him only looked at him with cold eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a phrase that a lot of rom-com protagonists use, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, without going out with me, but without clearly rejecting me, you're just keeping me warm for when you need me? That really is the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun is the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The worst… I'm the worst…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the scene unfold, Keiki couldn't hold back a snicker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't laugh at me… Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, it just happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">And Koharu also started smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I was only joking. Since you said crazy things like 'I'm a lolicon after all,' you'll have to endure it if I tease you a little bit." "Uu… you're right. I'm really sorry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hurting, apologizing, forgiving, and starting from zero-</p>
<p class="null-p">To answer the boys confession, the girl looked straight at her loved one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy to just be next to Shouma-kun. Let's start as friends."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah. I'm looking forward to it, Koharu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it turned out a bit different from what the cupid had hoped for, this clearly wasn't the worst result.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good for you, Koharu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…!" She let out a bright smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Girls really are the cutest when they smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why is it so dark in here? Let's open up the curtains."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah…… Hmm? Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">All brain cells were screaming danger inside Keiki's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second, Shouma!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki was just a bit too late to reach Shouma. The sunlight entered the room, and the ikemen squinted against it.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in the next moment, the boy's expression froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What he now saw were countless photos of him, pinned on the walls and the ceiling. The Akiyama collection that Koharu had produced over the course of the last year.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please think about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of reaction would the boy have?</p>
<p class="null-p">Would he be happy and scream out "So this girl likes me this much! I'll love her too!" ?</p>
<p class="null-p">No, the normal reaction would be "Scary?! What the hell is this?!" And of course, Akiyama Shouma was no exception.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at this mass of photos of him, he was at a loss for words. The cupid for his part felt the same. In addition, the cupid was assaulted with a feeling of despair. The calm atmosphere that the room had just moments before took a 180, and suddenly the room felt weighed down by gravity like a funeral.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Did Koharu-chan take all these pictures?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes, I took every single one of them!" She sounded like she wanted to be praised.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, her target's eyes looked even more dead inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe going out with a girl older than me really is impossible…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you might be right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki understood that this was completely unacceptable. No matter how cute she might be, her being such a pervert was too much to handle for Shouma. The stalker girl's feelings were so heavy that even the ace of the tennis club couldn't return them.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: A Little Sister's All You Need</p>
<p class="null-p">A Sunday in late June. It was a morning with a bright blue sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was holding the pair of pure white panties with his arms stretched towards the ceiling. No matter how you looked at it, this clearly made him look like a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, whose panties are these…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just recently, Keiki had found out that his new Cinderella candidate, Fujimoto Ayano, was actually a hardcore olfactophile. Basically, she's the kind of person who's turned on by a boy's body odor. She had become addicted to Keiki's smell when he caught her on the stairs, and she practically glued herself to him for days afterwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though Fujimoto-san has a cute face, she really is a pervert through and through…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, Keiki decided to give up on the thought that Ayano was Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, is Cinderella really one of the girls from the club…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who is a genius when it comes to calligraphy, and who likes to play pranks on her junior: Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">The straightforward and honestly cute angel-like Kohai: Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">The kind tsundere classmate: Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">But all of them were perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like wanting to become Keiki's pet, or wanting him to become her slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki seriously doubted that these wishes were born out of romantic feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm… I don't get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he had wished that these pure white panties belonged to a normal girl, and she had really just happened to drop them by accident, Keiki had started to believe that this wish wouldn't be granted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… it's true that they're all cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he knew their true personalities, his heart couldn't help but skip a beat whenever they showed him a bewitchingly cute smile. If you ignored the fact that they were all perverts, they were all charming women with no room for complaints.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would I be able to fall in love with one of them because of her cuteness, even if they're all perverts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, 'Would I be able to accept a perverted girl?'</p>
<p class="null-p">If one of those girls really turned out to be Cinderella, Keiki still didn't know how he would respond to their feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I'll go wash my face to freshen up."</p>
<p class="null-p">He hid Cinderella's panties in a safe location and left his room. Having just woken up, he was wearing a normal t-shirt and shorts. He went downstairs to the first floor bathroom. When he casually opened the door…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That baffled voice came from the person currently occupying the bathroom. Her almost-shoulder-length hair was still wet, maybe because she had just finished taking a shower. She seemed to have finished putting on her panties, because she was currently holding her bra in her hands, with her breasts still enjoying some fresh air. Her slender shoulders, her cute belly button, her white legs - everything was visible, and there wasn't anything that you could complain about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Nii-san?" Mizuha didn't panic at all, but only hid her breasts with her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though her cheeks were slightly flushed, she still returned the gaze of her big brother, who still couldn't look away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if we're siblings, it's still embarrassing, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! I'm very sorry!" The boy bowed down with all of his might and hurriedly closed the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh… that really surprised me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her and Keiki had lived in the same house for years. Accidentally watching the other change clothes, accidentally opening the door to the bathroom when the other was using the toilet - things like this happened fairly often. They tried their best to make sure these kinds of accidents didn't happen, and they had only happened very rarely since they had entered high school. Since his mind was somewhere else, though, Keiki had completely forgotten that Mizuha liked to take showers in the morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When she's wearing clothes, she looks rather slender."</p>
<p class="null-p">But in reality, her breasts were quite formidable in size. And her pastel green panties also really suited her. Remembering that sight made Keiki's cheeks burn up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Come on, why is my heart beating so fast from seeing my little sister naked…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew very well that he was a siscon to a certain agree, but even he was aware that these feelings just now were completely unacceptable. A big brother shouldn't lust after his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he wanted to wash his face to calm down, the bathroom was currently in use, so he had no other choice but to wait. And this was only the beginning of day.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Mizuha finished putting on her clothes and came to Keiki's room. They sat on top of the bed, backs against each other, reading. Things like this would usually only be done by a young couple in love, but to Keiki and Mizuha this level of skinship was normal. Though Mizuha hadn't said anything about the incident, Keiki noticed that she was turning the pages of her book more slowly than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think of pastel green panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really think that they suit you, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">At first glance, it was a really weird back-and-forth. But in order to hide their embarrassment, it was a necessary conversation to distract them from what had happened. Like a joke to lighten the mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Entering the bathroom when I was in the middle of putting on clothes might've been nothing but an accident on Nii-san's part, but that doesn't mean that I didn't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really sorry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I know that you didn't do it on purpose."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no tone of anger to be found in her voice. It seemed like she really did forgive him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's weird. This hasn't happened since we were in middle school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I normally am really careful about it, but it totally slipped my mind today because I was thinking about something else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you troubled by something again? Do you need someone to talk to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit difficult to explain…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to hold back. Nii-san and I are family."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh no, I just mistook my little sister for an angel."</p>
<p class="null-p">He really was proud of his little sister. She was like an oasis that would heal his heart every time it got hurt because of perverted girls - girls both inside and outside the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what would you do if I told you that I wanted to make a girl my pet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Report you to the police, probably?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what if I wanted to become a girl's slave?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Report you to the police."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I wanted to smell a girl's panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Report you to the police."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures~ I'm really glad. It seems that I'm not the weird one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Asking your little sister these kinds of questions is a bit weird, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what would you do if I said that I wanted to fall in love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Report you to the police."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm joking. Since Nii-san is always so serious, I would support you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay. Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're welcome. That was my thanks for you praising my panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of reason is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With their backs to each other, they couldn't read each other's expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">But their conversation still continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, it seems like there's a pretty famous lucky charm for high school girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lucky charm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you want to confess to a boy, you wear pink underwear. It's supposed to bring good luck," Keiki explained.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. That one's pretty popular with the girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. It seems like it's spread pretty far…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why does Nii-san know of that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A certain Senpai told me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, the conversation stopped and they once more focused on reading their respective books. As the sunlight pleasantly shone into the room, only the sound of turning pages could be heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sometimes, it's nice to just relax, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being with someone who lets you relax is the best. For Keiki, this was the most blissful way to spend time. His heart had been through a lot of stress lately, and he felt like he really needed something like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">After around two hours of reading, Mizuha closed the book in her hands and stood up from the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's have lunch soon. Is there anything you want, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As long as it's made by Mizuha, I'm fine with absolutely anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That kind of phrase is a wife's worst nightmare."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Simple is best. How about some noodles?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, how about some spaghetti? Maybe with some minced meat," With a cheerful tone, Mizuha left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Mizuha would be a great wife."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a cleaning fanatic, so she always kept the house spotless, and her cooking was top notch. Keiki was sure that there weren't many women with household skills like Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, what should I do after lunch-?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could watch a movie, and just lazing around until evening didn't sound too bad. Keiki really thought that this relaxing time would continue. But, about one hour after that, it all completely changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">An hour later, the Kiryuu siblings had finished eating lunch and were watching TV when the doorbell rang, indicating that they had a visitor. Keiki responded to it, and when he opened the door, he was greeted by a blackhaired beauty. It was Tokihara Sayuki, wearing a white blouse and long skirt, giving off a very adult-like aura.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good day to you, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, what brings you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had some free time so I decided to come over. Here, I brought a cake that I really recommend. Feel free to eat it with Imouto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, how polite of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, so Cake-kun is a cannibalist."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you would say that. It's really not funny… But, since you're here, why don't you come in for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to intrude~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Dropping the cake box off in the living room, he guided Sayuki towards his own room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you really keep it clean in here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha is a cleaning freak, so she would definitely scold me if I didn't clean up here from time to time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How nice. In the near future, this will be my pen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something about me that you aren't satisfied with? I'm a beautiful, big-breasted Onee-san, right? Am I not desirable for boys of your age?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. You were undesirable the moment you asked me to make you my pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">He motioned for Sayuki to sit down on a cushion reserved for guests and sat down next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, why did you come here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is something that I wanted Keiki-kun to see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something you wanted me to see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl opened her bag and took out a headband with dog ears, and placed it on her head. After that, she also donned an artificial dog tail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you ask me that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With the headband disappearing into her natural black hair, the ears completely looked like they were real. Keiki could only watch, wondering what she would do next, completely unable to understand why she would do something like this at her Kouhai's house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to be so wary. I won't do anything weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you're doing something pretty weird already…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it not cute?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit cute, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I like men who are honest."</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually, Sayuki looked really lovable right now. It had such an impact on him that Keiki completely forgot about the whole pet thing, and found himself wanting to take a picture of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for before," Sayuki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About what, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I was supposed to help out with the trash collection. See, uhm, a lot happened, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. That might be true, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">The memories of what had happened under the bridge slowly started to rise to the forefront of Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that I really went too far there, and I'm reflecting on it. Biting the hand that feeds you like that would make me a failure of a dog."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not the hand that feeds you, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, even though I've reflected on it myself, I still feel like there was something lacking from Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that I was a bit childish. But that's just because Keiki-kun's love for me wasn't nearly enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, dogs get nervous when they can't feel enough love and attention from their owners. That's why I came here today: To be cherished by Keikikun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do understand the reasoning behind it, but what exactly should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to treat me like a dog."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not happening."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, so you won't. Well, I really didn't want to have to use this, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki slowly took an item out of her bag. It was the BL manga drawn by Nanjou Mao. A doujinshi where Keiki and Shouma - no, Keeki and Shouto were exceptionally close to each other, to put it mildly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you won't, I will be forced to show this to Imouto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please refrain from doing that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you should know what you have to do, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Fine. I will treat Sayuki-senpai like a dog."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki accepted her conditions, Sayuki let out a beaming smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But what exactly should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you never played with a dog before, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have. We had a big dog at my grandfather's place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you just have to do to me what you did with that dog."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see. Then… Tokihara-senpai, hand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woof!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki stretched out his hand with these words, Sayuki followed suit and put her own hand on top of his, with a very blissful expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Keiki became a bit flustered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What should I do next?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me see… I want you to pet me on the head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Then, come over here," Keiki beckoned her to come closer, and Sayuki did as she was told, sitting next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he started petting her on the head, she happily closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu… This makes me really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy to hear that."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Although Keiki was a bit worried when she asked him to 'Treat her like a dog', skinship of this level was of no problem for him. On the contrary, he even started to enjoy it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, he continued to pet her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he had realized it, Sayuki was looking straight at him with slightly flushed cheeks and expectant eyes. This look on her face made Keiki even more nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you pet a dog on the belly, they get really happy too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, the preparations were done and Sayuki was lying down on top of the bed, face up. She had the three lowest buttons of her blouse opened, leaving her white belly perfectly visible. Normally, dogs won't show their bellies to just anyone, but only to the people they really trust.</p>
<p class="null-p">Does this mean that Sayuki trusts me this much? As the young boy thought that, he could feel his cheeks getting hotter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hurry up and pet me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While sitting next to Sayuki, he nervously started petting her on the belly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mhm… Fufu, it tickles."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I would think so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels really weird, and it's even more embarrassing than I thought it would be."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then should I stop?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. I've finally gotten Keiki-kun to treat me like a dog, so I won't let it end here. It tickles, and I'm embarrassed, but it still feels very comforting. Do it more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl once more closed her eyes, seemingly enjoying the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she once more started breathing heavily, which sounded very erotic. It was a bit too stimulating for the young boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I feel like I'm starting to understand what a dog feels like," Sayuki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being pet like this makes me feel all happy inside, and it feels like I don't need anything else in my life. Dogs must want this all the time because they can directly feel the kindness of their beloved owners."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Sayuki-senpai is happy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it feels like I just ate a lot of sweets."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really get it, but I can tell that you're enjoying it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To show Keiki-kun what this feeling is like - I can only do something like this, I think?" Saying that, Sayuki stretched out both of her arms and pulled Keiki into her breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Mguh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Keiki's face felt really happy. They were so incredibly soft; the best kind of cushion there could ever be. The softness combined with her sweet smell caused Keiki to immediately start to relax.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's your impression of your favorite breasts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To put it simply… it's the best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good boy. Ahh, you're so cute. Just how cute can you be, Keiki-kun…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she found the words of her male Kouhai even more stimulating. Her legs started flailing up and down like a little kid's, and she strengthened her grip on Keiki's head. Because of that, Keiki's head started to sink even deeper into her breasts, until-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fugah?! Hmmmghghg?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as one would expect, Keiki's air supply was cut off from being buried inside the girl's big breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like heaven and hell at the same time. And just when Keiki started to black out-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, I brought some tea for the two of-"</p>
<p class="null-p">With terrible timing, the door to Keiki's room opened. If you thought about it objectively, it was pretty obvious that Keiki's mindful little sister would prepare some tea for her guest. And when she entered the room with some tea and sweets, her reaction was to be expected. After all, her big brother was currently face-deep inside a girl's breasts inside his own room, so Mizuha decided to act like she didn't see anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take your time~" She backed out the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait?! I don't need your consideration here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving Sayuki behind, Keiki dashed after his little sister. And with that, an emergency family meeting started inside the living room. The reason for that was of course the illicit relations going on inside the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Forcing a girl to wear dog ears and pushing yourself onto her chest like that… Nii-san is quite the pervert after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong! It's not like that! I was just petting Sayuki-senpai on the belly is all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Petting a girl on the belly? I really can't advocate a hobby like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh?! The more I try to explain the situation, the worse it gets…!" After that, Keiki got scolded by Mizuha for quite some time.</p>
<p class="null-p">This must be what it feels like to be scolded by your wife…</p>
<p class="null-p">Around 3pm, the silhouettes of Sayuki and Keiki could be seen standing in the entrance of Keiki's house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really had fun today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It felt like my lifespan shortened when Mizuha walked in on us…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? It actually felt really good to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unlike Senpai, I don't feel any pleasure from being embarrassed like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki was freed from Mizuha's long lecture, he had returned to his room, where Sayuki was patiently waiting for him, only for her to tell him "I guess I'll excuse myself for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had only stayed over for about two hours. It seemed like she hadn't planned on staying for too long anyway. As Keiki escorted her to the entrance, he asked her a certain question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, can't you find anyone else other than me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Back when Sayuki had asked Keiki to 'Make me your pet', Keiki answered with a very direct 'NO!' So why? Why wouldn't she search for someone else</p>
<p class="null-p">-?</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what he thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There should be other, more suitable people for Senpai that'd be willing to make you their pet, so why-"</p>
<p class="null-p">What stopped him mid-sentence was Sayuki's finger on his lips. Keiki's heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even hardcore masochists like me have their pride. I won't give my heart to just anybody, and I don't want to be dominated by anyone else. I can only think of Keiki-kun as my master," With these words, Sayuki came closer and licked Keiki's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm marking you. Since my owner seems to be quite popular, I have to show them that you belong to me, and I to you." Winking at Keiki, she turned around and walked away. "Thanks for today. Thanks to your love, I'm really satisfied."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not say things that could be easily misinterpreted?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving words behind that could stir up rumours in the neighbourhood, the girl went home.</p>
<p class="null-p">Approximately five minutes after Sayuki went home, the doorbell to the Kiryuu household rang again. What greeted Keiki as he opened the door was a beaming smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan? What brings you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika was bored, so she decided to come over and play."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like she was switching places with Sayuki. Now it was Keiki's blondehaired Kouhai, Koga Yuika. Today, she was wearing a skirt, which was a bit on the short side, and a cream-coloured cardigan, which made her give off the impression of an energetic girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, please take these sweets Yuika made. Enjoy them with Mizuhasenpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, how polite. I will."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the paper bag she brought, there were several neatly-wrapped madeleines.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you're here already, come on in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to bother~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Handing over the sweets to Mizuha, who was sitting in the living room, he guided Yuika to his room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, this is the first time Yuika has been in Keiki-senpai's room," The blonde-haired beauty looked around the room. "Yuika can't find any perverted books at first glance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would be really bad if you found them that easily."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means that you have some?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm……… For now, have a seat."</p>
<p class="null-p">He motioned for her sit down on the same cushion, and sat down across the table. Mizuha brought some tea into the room, and Yuika voiced her thanks.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yuika started elegantly sipping the hot tea, Keiki closely inspected her. He had felt this way with Sayuki before, but having a girl inside his own room really did make him quite nervous. After all, she wouldn't just come visit if she didn't have any romantic feelings for him. As an adolescent boy, this kind of thing made him really happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that would only be true if it were a normal girl. And Koga Yuika wasn't normal. Stuffing your freshly-worn panties into the mouth of a boy isn't normal behaviour at all. Though he had a similar uncomfortable feeling with Sayuki, Yuika would become a bit more dangerous if things went south.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what brings you here today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will just say it outright. She came here to train Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Training, huh……… Wait, training?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, Keiki-senpai hasn't had any respect for Yuika. For example, you took a picture when Yuika was wearing a bunny girl suit, and you grabbed her breasts without her consent. With that in mind, Yuika thought that she needed to teach him what it means to be a slave. She needs to give him a bit of discipline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no, I'm not your slave, you know? I'm really not a big fan of you saying things like 'training' and 'discipline'…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. Yuika did say 'training,' but it will only be very gentle. She just thought she'd embarrass Keiki-senpai a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something embarrassing…? What do you have in mind, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Precisely this right here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In one fluid motion, she took out all the parts to a bunny girl costume: The rabbit ears, the black-netted tights, and the black suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">But for some reason, Keiki had a really bad feeling as he inspected the costume in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The size seems to be a bit bigger than the one she wore at the calligraphy clubroom…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… So Yuika-chan is going to change into a bunny girl suit here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying? Keiki-senpai is going to be the one to wear this costume."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will thoroughly enjoy the sight of an embarrassed Senpai while he wears these clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You're joking, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course Yuika isn't joking? She is super serious."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika responded to Keiki's shaking voice with a beaming smile, which made him shiver.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl is serious. She really wants me to wear this bunny girl costume.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you seriously forcing a boy to wear a bunny girl costume?! Nobody's going to gain anything from that, you know?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you won't listen, Yuika will be forced to punish you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Punish me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will show this book to Mizuha-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't the first time he had seen that book cover today. It was the BL manga that Mao-sensei had made. It seemed like every female member of the calligraphy club owned a copy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Keiki's reaction, the devilish little Kouhai showed a bewitching smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Keiki-senpai. What will you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please choose. Become a bunny girl, or let Mizuha see Senpai's embarrassing BL manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both of them aren't favorable in any way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A: Become a pervert by wearing a full-body bunny girl suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">B: Let your little sister see the BL manga where you are the model for one of the characters.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever he chose, it would end painfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, he didn't want to wear those clothes. He didn't want to feel that embarrassment. But he hated the idea of Mizuha reading the BL manga even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just imagining her reaction… "Nii-san is so filthy." Keiki might as well die from a heart attack if that happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">And Kiryuu Keiki's answer was…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Approximately ten minutes later, Yuika was sitting on the floor, trying to contain her laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu… Ahahaha, Keiki-senpai, it suits you too well… Fufufufufu, Yuika's stomach is starting to hurt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, you're laughing way too much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The owner of the room said this as he looked down at her. He wasn't wearing his usual clothes. Rabbit ears were protruding upwards from his head. His legs were wrapped in netted tights. On his butt, he had a small, round tail, which only intensified how unbalanced his appearance was. Inside his own room, this high school student was wearing a bunny girl costume. When girls wear such an outfit, it makes every boy's heart flutter, but a boy wearing it looked like a scene straight out of hell. Seeing himself in the mirror made the poor boy want to jump out of a window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu, Yuika just laughed enough for a whole year." After rolling around on the floor, hugging her belly, she finally got up. "Let's take a commemorative picture, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so shocked by that? Keiki-senpai took a photo of Yuika when she wore that bunny girl costume."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just do as you want…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, Yuika would like a sexy pose."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes… something like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that leopard-pose is great! Please look over here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika looked happy the whole time while she took photos of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. To look so happy while wearing clothes that would make any girl embarrassed; Keiki-senpai really is a rascal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rascal?! Did you just call me a rascal?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Keiki was the one who was forced to wear these clothes. While he was miffed at being so unreasonably insulted, the Kouhai continued her photo session. After some time, Keiki finally received permission to sit down again. Now a blonde-haired girl and a bunny boy were facing each other at the table. It really was a weird scene to behold. Yuika had an even more comforting smile on her face than before. "Keiki-senpai really is a weird person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're talking about these clothes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. She's talking about you. A normal person wouldn't just sit there and let this be done to him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you threatened me, so I didn't really have any choice at all." "…Then, did you start to hate Yuika because she forced you to do this?" "Eh?" Not expecting a question like that, Keiki looked up at her in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he did so, he saw that Yuika was grinning at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. It's because of that expression that I want Keiki-senpai to become my slave."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been played. Although she had done some pretty cruel things to him, he never had hated her for it. Realizing that, Keiki got a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Yuika is in a good mood today, she will give Keiki-senpai a reward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reward?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She stood up on the spot and put her hands under her skirt, only to pull down her cute, blue panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait?! Why are you taking off your panties?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thought that she needed to give Senpai something good to mix it up a bit. It's Yuika's duty as a master to reward her servant from time to time, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why does it have to be your underwear?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, any boy would love being given a pair of girl's panties, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Well, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would they hate it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, they'd be happy about it. But… how do I say it… it doesn't exactly have to be freshly-worn panties, and what makes them so great is that we can't get them easily."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't really understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you not have any qualms about just handing out your panties to a boy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course Yuika wouldn't do this to just any boy. Keiki-senpai is special to Yuika, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Special…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was something that Yuika had said before. That the only person she wanted to make her slave was Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you're special to Yuika, she would always give you her panties if it made you happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">This reminded Keiki of when Yuika had confessed to him that she wanted him to become her slave. Thinking that it would make him happy, she took off her panties at the time. Though her means were a bit strange, she did just want to make him happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened? You're just staring at Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Keiki had found out about Tokihara Sayuki's and Koga Yuika's real personalities, he had thrown away the possibility that one of them might actually be Cinderella. But even Ootori Koharu, a perverted stalker girl, had fallen in love with Shouma. She became a stalker exactly because she felt that way towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">What if Sayuki and Yuika were the same? What if their 'love' turned them into total perverts?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Senpai? It's pretty embarrassing if you keep staring at Yuika like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Oh yeah, sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His Kouhai's cheeks were slightly flushed. Just like that, she suddenly returned to being a normal girl in Keiki's eyes. Her cute, embarrassed expression completely threw Keiki off balance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also… Fufu, if you make such a serious face while wearing those clothes,</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika might start laughing again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were the one who told me to wear them… Well, I guess I can change back now. Yuika-chan, would you be so kind as to leave the room for a second?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, Yuika will do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">She went to stand up, but had completely forgotten that her blue panties were still pulled down around her thighs. Because of that, she lost her balance, and</p>
<p class="null-p">-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…E-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, her small body started falling over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Careful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tried to catch her, reaching overtop of the table with his hand, only for him to fall over as well with a loud crash. Fortunately, it didn't seem like Yuika was hurt. Her sweet aroma and the feeling of her soft shoulders were making his head spin, but he soon got a hold of himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes. Yuika is fine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hugging, and being hugged, the distance between the two of them was practically nonexistent. And in that position, their gazes met. The young girl's blue eyes were watery, and her shoulders were tensing up, showing that she was indeed a bit nervous. That sight of her was so cute, that Keiki completely forgot to let go of her-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san? I heard a really loud noise just now, but-"</p>
<p class="null-p">And with the worst possible timing as usual, the door opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-, am I interrupting something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even with that weird scene in front of her, Mizuha reacted rather calmly. Keiki was still wearing a bunny suit, while Yuika wasn't wearing any panties. And the two of them were practically hugging each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai‐?! This was definitely not supposed to happen?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. Though that's supposed to be my line," Mizuha grinned as she closed the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hurriedly chased after her, but he completely forgot that he was still wearing the bunny girl suit. This of course resulted in an icy cold glare from Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think that Nii-san had a hobby like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the biggest misunderstanding of the century!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you force your Kohai to take off her panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan just took them off on her own accord!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way that there'd be a girl like that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, apparently there is! There are countless girls you'd never imagine would exist!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are we still talking about the same world? Is this an Isekai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuuuoooooo?! My little sister doesn't trust her Onii-chan's words!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The misunderstanding only continued to grow. And it took him about 30 minutes until his little sister finally started to trust her big brother again.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuika had gone home for the evening, the Kiryuu household finally calmed down again. The two of them finished eating Mizuha's delicious dinner, and he let her use the bath first while he returned to his room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, he was laying on his bed, checking his smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh, I've got some messages."</p>
<p class="null-p">During the time he had been eating dinner, he had left his phone in his room. When he checked the contents of the messages-</p>
<p class="null-p">'I went on a date with Koharu-chan' 'I went on a date with Shouma-kun' 'I finished the new manuscript' 'I want Kiryuu-kun's underwear. I wanna sniff it' and so on, so Keiki just wrote short responses to all of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for the date report, he sent a blessing, but still mentally cursed them with 'Normies should just explode'. To the BL manga creator, he wrote 'Good work~'. And finally, to the sexual harassment email, he wrote 'Why don't you just sniff your own panties, then?'. And, just when he had finished responding to all of them, a new message came in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he had responded to her email, she had written him a short message.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Can we talk right now?'</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he didn't have any reason to decline, he answered with a short 'Yeah, sure,' and shortly after that Nanjou called him on the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">「-Evenin', Kiryuu.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty rare for Nanjou to call me. Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">「Right now, I'm drawing a scene where Shouto is playing with Keeki's nipples.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it okay if I hang up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">「Wait wait! I'm having trouble drawing it, so I was hoping that maybe you could help me out.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"I imagine I'm gonna regret asking, but what do you have in mind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Can you moan for me? I wanna know what it sounds like when someone plays with your nipples.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly decline!"</p>
<p class="null-p">「Then, something else. Did President and Yuika come over to your house today by any chance?」</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm surprised you know that."</p>
<p class="null-p">「The two of them were proudly talking about their plans in the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">And I was listening to them while I was working on my manuscript.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So they were planning it ahead of time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had thought that Yuika's timing was a bit too perfect, but it seems like they were taking turns. It really made Keiki wonder if they were actually on good terms with each other or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">「I actually meant to obstruct them, but the deadline for my manuscript made it impossible for me.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there even a time when you don't have a deadline for anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">「So… nothing happened, I presume?」</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lot happened, but I don't really want to talk about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially not about the part when he was forced to wear a bunny girl suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">「I see… Hm, it seems good so far.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing. I was just a bit relieved.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"???" Keiki tilted his head after hearing that from the other side of the call.</p>
<p class="null-p">And since this was a phone call, he couldn't guess anything from her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">「Hey, Kiryuu… Have you ever gone out with a girl before?」</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me? What's with that so suddenly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">「I know that you don't have a girlfriend right now, but what about middle school? I was just a bit curious.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't have one. Sadly."</p>
<p class="null-p">「I see. Just as I imagined.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm gonna pretend that I didn't hear that comment…"</p>
<p class="null-p">「…Then, for example… what about… me?」</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">「I'm just joking.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say that! That's bad for my heart! It made my heart race, so please don't make any jokes like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">「Ah, I made your heart race, huh? …Fufu.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you seem so happy about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I-It's nothing. -Well, I'm hanging up now. Night!」</p>
<p class="null-p">She suddenly started talking faster and hung up immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that about…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had no idea what Mao had planned with that. Maybe she really just wanted to hear his moaning voice, but it still felt like there was more to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Keiki had no one except himself to blame for his inability to see this flower of youthful love that was blooming before his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was immediately after his phone call with Mao. Mizuha came to his room wearing pyjamas, having finished taking her bath. For some reason, she was holding her favourite hairdryer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, will you dry my hair?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ahh, yeah. Sure! Can do."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Keiki agree to her request, she walked up next to him and sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">But for some reason, she sat down on Keiki's lap as he was sitting on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you a spoiled child now, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the privilege of a little sister to be spoiled by her big brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't say anything if you use your influence here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm. You may start~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of queen are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he let out a small giggle, he started drying his little sister's hear. After he started, Mizuha closed her eyes, seeming to enjoy it.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_15.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The both of them had done this on a regular basis when they were younger. But, no matter how close they might have been, there were still a boy and a girl. They couldn't take a bath together anymore, and they had started sleeping in separate futons. Although it felt like there was a certain barrier between the two of them after today's events, he decided to forget about it for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-And, done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she gave Keiki her thanks, she didn't move from her spot. Rather, she leaned her back against him like a relaxed cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really surprised today. To think that those two girls were actually perverts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was the same for me when I first found out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Keiki had to explain the situation to her earlier, he had no other choice but lay bare the true identity of Sayuki and Yuika. If he didn't, he would be the one treated as a pervert instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This turned out to be rather interesting, right, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's really not interesting at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Might it be that you're a bit happy to be so popular like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They might actually be a good fit for Nii-san. You're a siscon, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being a siscon doesn't make me a pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She really has a sharp tongue today…</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she very rarely got mad, this was quite the unusual occurrence for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha, are you mad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not really mad. It's just…" She turned around to look at Keiki, and with a sulking expression, she continued, "Nii-san-is my Nii-san alone, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She sounded like she was blaming her cheating boyfriend, like she wanted to claim sole ownership of her big brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">Conclusion: Keiki became a siscon because his little sister Mizuha was just too cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">A little sister's all you need, huh…</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking a bath, Keiki returned to his own room. He guessed that his little sister had already gone to sleep because the lights were out in her room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll go to sleep as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was already past ten at night. Though it was a bit earlier than when he normally went to bed, a lot had happened today, which made him feel a bit more tired than usual. "But, before that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He turned over the mattress of his bed. Underneath said mattress were wood panels. Once he pushed on one of the panels, the cover opened, revealing a small box. A secret space that nobody except for him knew about.</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with the love letter, he also hid the panties of the girl in there. And his porn magazines, of course.</p>
<p class="null-p">People always feel the urge to keep an eye on their secret treasures. Recently, it had become Keiki's habit to check on the love letter and panties every night before he went to sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I just checked this morning, so they should still be there… And just as he had guessed, the pink envelope was present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh? Eh? W-Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But even though he had just checked this morning, a crucial item was missing from the hidden box.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cinderella's panties… are gone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Keiki, it was like Cinderella's glass shoe. That one and only physical hint had completely disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cinderella's panties had disappeared from Keiki's room. For now, Keiki deduced that his little sister Mizuha hadn't taken them. After all, if that were the case, the next morning would have started with a greeting from Mizuha, saying "Nii-san, whose panties are these?", followed by an emergency family meeting. That only left two possible candidates.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki and Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them had a chance to steal the panties while Keiki was busy explaining the circumstances with Mizuha. "Maybe one of them really is Cinderella…" The following day, after class.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the astronomy club room, an emergency Cinderella meeting took place. The topic of the meeting was, of course, 'The stolen panties', and the number of participating members were three. With her trademark hoodie, Koharu was sitting on a chair, with Shouma next to her. Across the table was the victim.</p>
<p class="null-p">As an aside, as per Shouma's request, the photos on the ceiling inside the astronomy club room were all disposed of. Though the photos on the walls were still present, the aura in the air was less intimidating than before. After Keiki's successful (?) work as a cupid, Koharu had agreed to further help him concerning the Cinderella case, which is why she had offered him the astronomy club room as the 'Head office of the Cinderella search corps'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I'm more surprised that the Cinderella candidates are actually perverts. Tokihara-senpai is a hardcore masochist, Koga-san is a hardcore sadist, and Mao-chan is a fujoshi… I still can't believe it."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the explanations were over, Shouma was also up-to-date just like Koharu. He seemed very surprised that all of the members of the calligraphy club were perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki, you seem to have it pretty rough, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you forgetting that you're not just a bystander in Nanjou's case?</p>
<p class="null-p">She's drawing a BL manga with the both of us in it, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't really mind if it's Keiki and me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Geh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shouma-kun?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short pause, the person who created such a frozen atmosphere started giggling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha, I'm just joking. Boys aren't in my strike zone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are good and bad jokes, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I thought my heart was about to stop…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, they returned to the topic at hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I initially thought that neither Sayuki-senpai nor Yuika-chan were Cinderella. To me it seemed like they just wanted me to become either their master or slave. I didn't think that either of them held any special affection towards me, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yesterday, both Sayuki-senpai and Yuika-chan were wearing pink underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Underwear? What's that about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a lucky charm. When confessing to the boy you like, wearing pink underwear will increase your odds of him saying yes. Or so the superstition goes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, so that's why."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When Sayuki-senpai confessed, she also wore pink underwear. And the panties that Yuika stuffed in my mouth were also pink."</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no way that Keiki could forget those two scenes. He remembered the color of their underwear as clear as day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the envelope to the love letter is also pink."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see. It sounds like too much of a coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot of girls know of that lucky charm. Keiki really couldn't believe that this all had happened by pure chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I guess that there's a chance that either one of them, or possibly both of them, are in love with Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu, it makes me feel a bit embarrassed if you put it like that, but it seems plausible."</p>
<p class="null-p">He recalled what had happened the day prior. Sayuki's soft-feeling body, and Yuika's embarrassed expression. Thinking that they might have some sort of affection for him, he felt the blood rush to his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's true that the two of them have a high chance of being Cinderella." "Yes, considering that Cinderella's panties disappeared from Keiki's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">And exactly on the day when the two of them paid you a visit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Cinderella wanted to take back her panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would make sense, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that means something very important."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it really was Cinderella, why did she take the panties with her, but not the love letter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So, she really did drop her panties by accident…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe she panicked when she heard Keiki returning to the room at the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, that still leaves the mystery of why she even had a new pair of panties with her in the first place."</p>
<p class="null-p">Possibly because she had meant to change into them later on. But there was no way to actually find out, except for asking the person herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe it's actually an important clue that Cinderella took the panties back with her. That means that the person who currently is in possession of them should be the girl who wrote the love letter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. That would be definite proof."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Cinderella is hiding her real identity from Keiki. That would explain why she didn't put her name on the love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Keiki needed now was certain proof that the candidate was indeed Cinderella. And the panties themselves had very conveniently turned into that proof.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now you have another clue concerning Cinderella at least."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He once more needed to investigate both Sayuki and Yuika. One of them must be the 'thief'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But how can I actually find out if Cinderella really has the panties with her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about flipping their skirts?" Shouma suggested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I investigate? I'm really good at that sort of thing," Koharu offered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that investigating that would be a good idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Koharu could probably put up a camera inside the girl's changing room, the risk would be too great. What would happen if someone found that camera?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, what else could you do, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Kiryuu-kun, who do you think Cinderella is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me think…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Between Sayuki and Yuika, who had the highest possibility of being Cinderella? Judging from the information at hand, the scales drastically tipped towards a certain girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">The door to the room wasn't locked, and one girl was currently sitting in said room. As she stood by the window, the soft summer breeze gently made her hair flutter, and when she noticed Keiki's presence, she slowly turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you're awfully late. I didn't think that you would come by today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just Sayuki-senpai here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The other two didn't think that you would come by, so they went home already. I happened to run into Keiki-kun because I stayed behind, fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you sound so happy about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was saying that, he had a completely different thought in his mind. And that was nothing more than the girl who was currently right in front of him. Keiki's Senpai, the club president of the calligraphy club, and a hardcore masochist. Additionally, a Cinderella candidate with a very high potential of being the true Cinderella; Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the day of the cleaning operation, she was the last girl to leave the club room according to Mizuha. Basically, she was the person who stayed behind the longest. She really had the highest possibility of being the Cinderella who left behind that love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, what's wrong?" She looked at Keiki with a perplexed expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first glance, she was just like always. Her gestures, her way of talking, her atmosphere. It was the normal Tokihara Sayuki. If she really was Cinderella, she was playing it cool really well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have something important to talk about with Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What might that be? I won't tell you my three sizes, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… do you finally want to make me your pet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl said this clearly in jest. But Keiki answered seriously, and contrary to her expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. I might actually just do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?" The girl's eyes opened wide in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">While the girl was still standing at the window, Keiki softly put his hand on her snow white cheeks. This might actually be the turning point of their relationship. It might result in destroying their Kouhai-Senpai relationship, and forming a new bond. Keiki said the words that Sayuki had been waiting for for so long.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-I will become Sayuki-senpai's owner."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: I am a master</p>
<p class="null-p">This is a story from when Keiki had barely joined the calligraphy club. In his first year of high school, he went to visit the club as often as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you came today as well? It would've been fine if you were just a member in name, but this feels like you really are a real member. This might sound weird coming from me, but shouldn't you be enjoying your youth a bit more?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I can relax when I'm in here, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Kiryuu-kun really is weird sometimes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, am I distracting you from your work, by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, don't worry. It's a bit too quiet for me when I'm in here alone, so I'm actually really happy when you're here," She said and showed Keiki an honest smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the girl smiling like that, Keiki also was happy. Now that he thought about it, that smile was probably the main reason why he still came to this club. Simply because he didn't want to see a sad expression on her face. She was a girl who liked playing pranks on others, and often scribbled on his face. But when she was writing calligraphy, she looked like an adult. In that one year, he spent a little bit of time every day after classes in that room. The two of them exchanged words and slowly grew closer to each other. And before he had realized it, Keiki had started looking up to his Senpai.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The day after Keiki had stated that he would become Sayuki's master. It was after class, and Keiki was currently in the library. Not as a librarian, but merely as a patron. He was sitting at a table near a window, and reading a certain kind of manual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah, to think that I would find Kiryuu-kun in a place like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">With one eye hidden by her bangs, the female student Fujimoto Ayano walked over to him. And all of a sudden, she hugged him from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huggg~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Fujimoto-san? You're making it rather hard for me to breathe…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mhm, it's been a while since I got a good sniff of Kiryuu-kun. Ahhh, this is the best…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san is the same as always, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It completely ruined her beautiful appearance. She leaned forward and took a look at the book Keiki was reading.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you reading? …Dogs? Kiryuu-kun, are you going to adopt a dog?" "Not exactly. I'm just reading it for research."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you here because of your student council work, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Tests are soon, so I came here to study."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, thanks for the reminder. Finals are pretty soon, aren't they?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what you would expect from the vice president of the student council. Fujimoto Ayano really was a diligent student, going to the library to study like this. But sadly, she was also a pervert who gets aroused by the odor of a man's body. She really look a liking to Keiki's body odor for some reason, and even now she often clings to his neck like this. Keiki could only shudder at the thought that other people might mistake them for a lovey-dovey couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, Keiki also thought that Ayano might hold some sort of affection towards him. Having enjoyed his smell, Ayano stopped clinging to his back and sat down next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, let's make a competition out of our test scores. The loser gives their underwear to the winner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't wanna. And you still haven't given up on my underwear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just how much value they hold for me. I want to sniff them all night long…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At least you're really honest with your desires."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It just shows how good your smell is, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you're complimenting me on how I smell?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, haven't you ever gotten excited by a girl's smell before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you say it… Well, I have from time to time, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, when he was surrounded by the girls in the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do girls always smell so good, I wonder…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And it's the same for girls. They also get excited by smelling a boy's odor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I don't think that very many would get excited by my freshly-worn underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want to compare Ayano to a normal girl. While said girl took out a school workbook, she spoke in a nostalgic tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, did you see it? It's about to end, it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you haven't heard?" She asked in a surprised tone of voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Ayano told him after that was completely new information to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">That evening, Keiki was reading a manga inside his room. However, it wasn't his usual shounen manga, but rather a sparkly shoujo manga. Mizuha came into his room while he was enthusiastically reading said manga on his bed. She looked like she had just taken a bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Nii-san is reading a shoujo manga. How rare."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai lent it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai was that tiny third-year, right? I often see her together with Shouma, if I recall correctly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that Koharu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a lot of manga she gave you. How did she get all that here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She brought it in her car. It really was a lot of work to carry them all the way up here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can imagine. That's gotta be at least a hundred books."</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to the bed was a box that was filled to the brim with manga. Apparently Koharu was quite the shoujo manga fan. Out of her personal collection, she had decided to lend Keiki a careful selection. Just what you would expect from a company president's daughter. She was brought here by a driver with a black suit in a Peugeot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, this is perfect timing. I want Mizuha to lend me some of her</p>
<p class="null-p">shoujo manga as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really mind, but why are you reading them all of a sudden?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To become a perfect man. To achieve that, I will do anything, even if it makes me want to die from embarrassment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh. I don't really get it, but I can tell that Nii-san's all fired up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Today your Nii-san is more motivated than ever before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, the bath is free, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go in after I read a bit more. Tamami and Kyousuke are at a good spot right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. But don't take too long or the water will get cold, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki continued to read Shoujo manga every single evening. It was a particular kind of research that would greatly assist in his search for Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After school, he read books about dogs, and in the evening, he read shoujo manga. Like this, a week passed since Cinderella's panties had disappeared from Keiki's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki arrived at the plaza in front of the train station, Sayuki was already waiting for him. She was wearing a tidy blouse and a high-waisted skirt, which gave her a very adult-like impression. In addition, she had a small shoulder bag on her shoulders. Her expression looked happy, as if she were a dog waiting for her owner. "Good morning, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're very early. I came here ten minutes early, and you still beat me here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a faithful dog after all. I cannot make my master wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like that attitude at least."</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, he would always respond with "I'm not your master, though," but today was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, like I said before-" As he stood in front of his black-haired Senpai, he declared. "For this whole day, I will be Sayuki-senpai's master!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the theme of today's date was 'Being a master for one day'. Just as the name implied, Keiki would become Sayuki's master for this one day, and try his best to make her heart flutter with hardcore sadism. With that, he would be able to understand Sayuki even better, and he had the chance of finding out if she really was his Cinderella. That was why he had read all of those shoujo manga: To get a better understanding of what it means to be a sadistic character.</p>
<p class="null-p">I will not fail after so many nights of reading shoujo manga!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it's only for one day, it feels like a dream to have Keiki-kun as my master!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki for her part was excited for a completely different reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, let's go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, stop!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stopped Sayuki, who happily started walking in front of him. As he grabbed her by the collar, she let out a voice like a strangled frog.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing? You're going to stretch out my clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The dog cannot walk in front. He should walk next to his owner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… that's right. I'm sorry, Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki? Today, it's supposed to be 'Master', right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes! Master!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them were already attracting cold gazes from the people around them, but they didn't pay them any heed. After all, today the two of them were owner and pet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, Senpai, let's go," With these words, Keiki grabbed his pet's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Master? Why are we holding hands?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we don't have a collar or a leash, we at least have to hold hands. Is that no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not impossible, but it still feels a bit embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been confused about this before, but why do you get embarrassed about that, and not about me treating you like a dog…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She doesn't think twice about letting Keiki touch her breasts, and she often talks about deflowering other boys, but as soon as he touches her hand, her cheeks get red. Keiki really didn't understand girls at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Girls have a lot going for them. Like preparation, courage, and so on. But you're right… today I'm just a pet," She muttered to herself, and tightened her grip on Keiki's hand. "…Don't let go, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, they finally started walking, their connected hands a leash. Keiki glanced at Sayuki walking next to him, and she had a very relaxed expression, which he thought was really cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they took the train and then the bus, they finally arrived at the amusement park. In the shoujo manga that he had borrowed, the rich boy (hardcore sadist) took his exclusive childhood friend maid heroine (tsundere) to an amusement park.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's quite a lot of people here," Sayuki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a school holiday, after all. Senpai, is there anything you want to ride?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… I'll let my master Keiki-kun decide."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Then the first thing we'll try will be-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki focused his gaze on a certain attraction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When it comes to amusement parks, the roller coaster is a must-ride."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he said the words 'roller coaster,' Sayuki raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai? Are you not good with that sort of thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, uhm, today… I'm wearing a skirt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that that will be a problem. Other people wearing skirts are riding it too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, but there's that one in a million chance, right?" She fiddled with her hands as she looked down at her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something is off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't tell me?!</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain possibility entered Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Might Sayuki-senpai actually be wearing the Cinderella panties?</p>
<p class="null-p">The pair of pure white panties that were left behind with the love letter. If</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki really was Cinderella, she would want to hide these panties from Keiki at all costs. But that was only if she were a normal girl, which sadly wasn't the case. After all, she was a hardcore pervert. She might actually be wearing those panties today to get a thrill out of it. For Keiki it might be impossible to understand, but for her, it might be a logical idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was all just theoretical. There was no concrete evidence, but it was worth investigating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand that Sayuki-senpai is trying to avoid the roller coaster."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But we're still riding it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?!" Sayuki looked like a dog who had just been denied his food. "D-Do we really have to…?" A fearful voice. And her watery eyes basically screamed out "I don't want to ride it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that made him want to be kind to her, but right now he sadly was a hardcore sadistic master. Even if the gods were to give in, he wouldn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today, I am Sayuki-senpai's master, right? Are you really going against my command here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… okay. As your pet, I would go through hell for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I wanted to hear~."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, they headed towards the roller coaster. Since it was a rather popular attraction, a lot of people stood in line for it, but luckily it wasn't that long of a wait until it was their turn. And, after listening to the staff's instructions, Keiki and Sayuki both sat down. The safety bar was dropped down to guarantee the safety of the passengers, and the ride slowly started to move. Slowly but steadily, it moved upwards on the rails.</p>
<p class="null-p">This calm before the storm was something that Keiki really enjoyed. When he looked at Sayuki next to him, she was pale, and was constantly checking her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…H-Hey, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you think that people's glasses would fly off if they rode this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? I don't think they do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he answered that random question, the roller coaster accelerated. With great speed, it raced down the rails-</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the conversations of the passengers stopped immediately. Keiki wondered if the ear-piercing scream he was hearing was coming from the girl next to him, or from somebody else. The only thing he knew for sure was that, even on this roller coaster, the girl's skirt wasn't lifted up at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That was scary…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, Sayuki had tears in her eyes as she stepped off of the roller coaster. It seemed like she was actually just afraid of it, and it had nothing to do with her skirt. But he had learned something new about her, which was good enough in Keiki's eyes. While they were contemplating what to do next, they saw a small girl walking towards them with a witch's wand in her hand. And, as she walked past them, the wand got stuck on Sayuki's skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after that, the girl hurriedly pulled the wand away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ugh…! So close! I could almost see her panties!</p>
<p class="null-p">There was actually a high school boy here who was frustrated about not being able to see a girl's panties. The girl with the wand immediately ran away as if nothing had happened. As the victim pushed down her skirt, she looked up at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Did you see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sadly, I did not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…" She let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the master standing next to her mentally confirmed once more that something really was off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Sayuki-senpai? Hurry up and eat it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But, in a place like this… how embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Senpai was the one who wanted it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but… Keiki-kun is such a tease. I'm getting even more embarrassed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you're not going to obey to your Master's orders?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This isn't fair…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Senpai, you actually enjoy this, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So mean… I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">After pulling it out, it slowly came closer to Sayuki's beautiful face. His long, thick meat stick. The girl looked at it in awe, gulped once, and slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's great. Get a good taste with that lonely mouth of yours."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yesh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, that's only the tip."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N… Nnn… Cheeky…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha. That face of yours is pure gold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want more, you have to beg for it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes. I-I want to eat more of Master's meat…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine. Eat as much as you want. Sayuki-senpai, is my meat that delicious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… T-This is… so delicious… I love it… Master's, long, thick… I love it…."</p>
<p class="null-p">With an expression like she was in trance - Sayuki was biting on a hot dog.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_16.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Even though it was something completely normal, it felt incredibly erotic. This kind of scene was something that you shouldn't show to younger children.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Sayuki were spending their dangerous lunch time at a food corner in the amusement park, at a table under the blue sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">They also had ordered some takoyaki and yakisoba. Though Keiki was the one who ordered the hot dog, Sayuki had said "Let me have a taste? Like you would feed a dog," which is why he had decided to share. And, as Keiki obliged, Sayuki was in an extremely good mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Being fed by Master like this in front of all these people really gets me excited."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy that you're enjoying yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why were you teasing me at the start?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I read that in a 'How to keep a pet' book. You can't spoil them too much. When you feed them, it's important to make the dog wait a bit so that they learn not to go on a rampage every time - it said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keeping a dog seems very complicated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the prices here really are crazy. I paid 400yen for one hot dog. Just what you would expect from an amusement park."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. The park maintenance must cost a lot, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the more the adults pay, the more the people here can put a smile on a kid's face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. When you put it that way, I might actually forgive them for the high prices."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though, the more kids come here, the more management will laugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He happened to imagine an old man sitting in a bathtub full of money with champagne in his hand. That scene almost made him lose his appetite.</p>
<p class="null-p">While eating takoyaki, he reminisced about the date so far. He had made Sayuki cry by forcing her to ride on the roller coaster, he made her eat a thick hot dog, and he was acting like a hardcore sadist with no concern for others. Everything that he had done so far wasn't scorned by the girl, though, but rather welcomed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that really was unexpected. I didn't think that Sayuki-senpai would be bad with roller coasters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It feels like my heart is jumping out of my chest, and I really don't like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so, you rode with me when I ordered you to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really makes me excited when I'm forced to do something. I hate it, but it feels really good. When Master is mean to me, I feel shivers of excitement."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She hated it so much that she cried, but still liked it because she was forced to do it. Sayuki really was a pervert through and through.</p>
<p class="null-p">…But Senpai looked really cute that time…</p>
<p class="null-p">He really thought that the sight of Sayuki shaking from fear wasn't too bad either. Though it was only acting for now, he thought that developing sadistic tendencies might not be so bad after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, developing those would be really bad, right?! -No! This is just for my investigation!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, it's nothing," He had happened to speak his prior sentence out loud. "Now then, since we've finished eating lunch, how about we keep going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Are we going to ride the rollercoaster again…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think Sayuki-senpai should be the one to decide now. If I keep up like this, my pet might start sulking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My pet, huh… Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Here was a girl who was actually happy to be called a pet. She's a pervert, but he was still finding it troublesome because she was so cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Master? I want to try this thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">What she pointed to was an attraction close to the roller coaster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're really high up, Master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well it is a Ferris wheel, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since you could enjoy the open scenery from these windowed gondolas, this ride was popular for a reason different from the roller coaster. Of course, a lot of couples would ride this attraction. Inside this small gondola, no one would be able to bother them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In here, I can be as much of a pet as I want," Sayuki stood up and sat next to Keiki. And, as if she wanted to be spoiled by her owner, she rested her head on his shoulders. "Fufu, I have Keiki-kun all to myself now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The sweet aroma of shampoo. The feeling of a girl's soft body, and her marshmallow-like soft voice assaulted Keiki. To Keiki, being like this with a cute girl like her was a dream come true. But this wasn't the main reason why he had come here with her. To find out the identity of Cinderella, he had to steel his heart and become a complete sadist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I actually planned to come here later, but now is fine I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, did you bring the collar with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes. Keiki-kun said that I should bring it with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please put it on, right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Punish you, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, the gondola they were riding in was wrapped in a bizarre atmosphere. Around the black-haired girl's neck was a bright red collar. The leash connected to that was in the hands of Keiki, and Sayuki was kneeling on the floor in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though I didn't you any permission, you clung to me. Sayuki-senpai really is a bad girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm sorry! Sayuki is a bad girl…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was attacked by the smiling boy's harsh words. Even so, when she looked up at him, there wasn't the slightest trace of sadness. On the contrary, she looked like she wanted to be insulted even more. Her eyes were glittering with excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Senpai. If you're really reflecting on your actions, then lick my finger to show me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">She put her mouth on his finger and kissed the fingertip countless times. Then, she opened her mouth to completely take in his finger. Every time she did so, her breasts shook.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you embarrassed to have such huge lumps of meat on your chest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yesh… I'm sorry for having these lumps of meat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai really is a perverted sow if she's getting so happy just from licking my finger."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yesh! Sayuki is a hopeless sow!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While she continued to lick Keiki's finger, she was bathed in insults. A perfect example of an SM play. According to Keiki's research, being forced to lick a boy's finger was quite the humiliation for a prideful woman. Of course, it was a perfect reward for a hardcore masochist. Sayuki looked extremely happy, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">…This is actually pretty bad…</p>
<p class="null-p">This was even more erotic than the hot dog scene. The soft, wet feeling on Keiki's finger made his head all wobbly, and the immoral feeling made his heart beat faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">This isn't good. Did I become a hardcore sadist…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he was supposed to only be doing this for his investigation, he actually felt himself enjoying it to a certain extent. While Keiki was feeling like he had awakened to something evil, Sayuki once more kissed his finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so happy… I'm so happy. Licking Keiki-kun's finger while being</p>
<p class="null-p">insulted like this, it feels like I'm dreaming." She wholeheartedly smiled at Keiki. "Thank you, Mast-"</p>
<p class="null-p">She unconsciously lifted up her body as she thanked Keiki. In this tiny gondola, they drew close to one another for a moment. And, in the next second, she accidentally - liked Keiki's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did her tongue just touch my lips-?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-?! E-Ehhhhhhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's brain couldn't keep up after this almost kiss, and he jumped up. Because of that sudden movement, the gondola shook, and he hit his head on the glass behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with a dull sound, a sharp pain assaulted Keiki's head. He found himself sinking back down in response, his vision turning blurry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Master?! Masterrrrrr?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the distance, he heard the girl's faint screams. But Keiki's body wouldn't respond, and he merely shut down.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a day in April after classes, shortly after he had entered high school. While he was walking down the hallway to make his way back home, he spotted something from the window. A female student was sitting on a bench in the courtyard. Her skirt was blue, indicating that she was a second-year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That person… her breasts are huge. Is she really a high school student?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he was quite a ways away from her, he could clearly see her two melons, barely contained within her uniform. Before he even came to know her as 'Sayuki-senpai', he decided to name her 'Big breasted-san' inside his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition to her big breasts, she had beautiful, long, black hair, and her skin was as white as snow. And most important of all, her eyes looked like she was about to cry. Before he had realized it, he was already standing in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he raised his voice, the girl looked at him with a bewildered expression. After that, she told him the story of all the senpais leaving the calligraphy club. With her as the only member, they would soon shut down the club. That's why she decided to hand out handmade flyers. Even to an amateur like him, the flyers looked really well-made, but nobody was showing much interest in joining. Not to mention that most new students had already found a club to join.</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering the circumstances, it was a small wonder that she wasn't getting any new members.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about I join?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …R-Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that would make Senpai stop crying, I'll gladly do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I wasn't crying at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the first time that Kiryuu Keiki and Tokihara Sayuki met. He had just happened to see her when she was crying, and happened to join the calligraphy club as a result of that.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">When he woke up, he was greeted by two big mountains.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you're finally awake?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… how do I say it, the view is impressive as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">The true identity of the two big mountains were the big breasts of Sayuki. They were as big as always. Apparently, Keiki was being given a lap pillow by the big-breasted beauty. He didn't know how much time had passed, but when he looked outside, the sky had already turned bright orange. And it seemed like most of the people visiting the park had already gone home. Keiki guessed that he had been out for quite some time. Maybe because he was sleep-deprived from spending the whole night reading shoujo manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's fine. You can stay like this for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was about to get up, but Sayuki pushed him down again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like I was sleeping like a god…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. You wouldn't wake up no matter what I did. After you didn't wake up even when the Ferris wheel stopped, a staff member carried you over here." "I'm sorry. Even though this was supposed to be a date, I completely ruined</p>
<p class="null-p">it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. As your pet, I'm happy that I can give Master a lap pillow like this. While you were sleeping, you were saying stuff like 'I'll forever be Sayuki's master!'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't say that, did I?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were asleep, right? How would you know that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I did, it doesn't count because I was talking in my sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a shame. But one day, I'll make you say these words on your own," Her smile was full of conviction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I saw a dream when I was out cold. It was about the first time I met Sayukisenpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, why were you so adamant about protecting the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'll be honest with you. I didn't like calligraphy that much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That confession was something that Keiki would've never expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our family was always rather fond of calligraphy, which is why they always forced me to write with a brush. Since my father was a professional, though, he was rather strict. Though I have a certain degree of freedom right now, I never really had the time to go out and play with my friends. I mostly spent my days writing, writing, and writing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds like a really strict childhood…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because of that, they didn't allow me to join any clubs, except of course the calligraphy club. That's why I just sort of joined. And the Senpais were all really nice. They were always praising me, saying that even though I was just a first-year, I was already better than them. They even patted me on the head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but don't worry. All the Senpai's were girls, so Keiki-kun was the first boy to ever pat me on the head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nobody was worrying about that, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a lie. He actually thought it for a small moment. He had just so happened to imagine a scene where another boy was patting her on the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh…? Why am I feeling so irritated because of that…?</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt a weird pain in his chest. Not knowing what exactly that was made him feel restless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since my father was always so strict, I wasn't accustomed to being praised like that. All of a sudden, the calligraphy club turned into a very important place for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The club he had joined just on a whim. In her first year, Sayuki was already surrounded by kind Senpais and fell in love with the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But since the club didn't have any second-years, I would've been the only one left once the Senpais graduated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you were crying in the courtyard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I wasn't crying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. You said the exact same thing back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu… Keiki-kun really is teasing me a lot today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you like it when your Master teases you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah. Ehehe. I love it when Keiki-kun teases me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she was without a doubt a pervert, Keiki was still happy that he found out something new about the girl's past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun? There is something that I want to know as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you suddenly decide to become my master for today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I thought that I wanted to know more about Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because Senpai is always so serious. When you're fighting with Yuikachan, when you're jealous of Fujimoto-san… That was all because you honestly wanted me to become your owner, right? That's why I decided to be serious as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought about Koharu, and how hard she was trying to get Shouma's affection, even though she was a pervert like Sayuki. That's why he had decided to get serious about the girls as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So that's why you were studying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? W-What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no use hiding it. You've been studying about dogs and how to keep them, right? Koga-san told me that you were reading books in the library. And the sadistic character you were acting out before was because you've been studying for my sake, right? Since it's Keiki-kun we're talking about, I imagined that you'd be studying through the whole night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So you knew already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should you really be forcing yourself to this degree even though you always tell me not to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's my privilege as your master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What an arrogant master you are… But I'm happy. You gave your best for me after all. Thank you for always being so kind to me," As she spoke these words with a soothing voice, she started stroking Keiki's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since this was the first time a girl other than his sister had done that for him, he felt really embarrassed, and his heartbeat accelerated. "Thanks to Keiki-kun, the club got more members too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The two of them really only do what they want though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. My Senpais weren't very hardworking, either. It's fine as long as we have fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That really does sound like Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she's working, it's like nothing can enter her ears, and when she's playing around, it's like she's just a kid. Maybe that's why he always had fun whenever he was with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it seems like the amusement park is about to close. Should we ride something to finish it off?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right… Hmm? Finish it off…? Ahhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He suddenly shot upright, and his head bumped into Sayuki's breasts. But he didn't have the time to enjoy that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, you really are so bold sometimes… Doing this in front of other people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, but that's not important right now. Sayuki-senpai, please come with me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what? Why are you panicking all of a sudden?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He hurriedly took Sayuki's hand, and pulled her off the bench.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's one more special place I would like to go to with Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki brought Sayuki to a big concrete building outside the amusement park.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We don't have much time, so let's hurry."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was almost the end of normal business hours, so they hurried to their destination. After receiving a pamphlet from the reception desk, he continued inside the building. Nobody was inside that room on the second floor. And in the most prominent place, a single work of art was showcased. The plaque next to it read 'Special prize: Tokihara Sayuki'. And on that long calligraphy paper was written: 'Evil spirits of rivers and mountains.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really can't read this. What does it say, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Evil spirits of rivers and mountains, it says."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically apparitions? Why would you go with that choice…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I was in a good mood, I couldn't think of anything. I happened to fall asleep a bit later, and small apparitions appeared in my dream, saying that I should hurry up and write. All of a sudden, they jumped into my paper. When I woke up, it was already written."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no, what kind of apparitions are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the problem with geniuses. They can never explain anything normally. But Keiki set that thought aside for now. The words written on that paper were without a doubt created by the girl standing next to him. This work was the reason that they had to thoroughly clean the calligraphy clubroom back in May.</p>
<p class="null-p">The building they were in was a public culture assembly hall. On the way in, there was a sign that indicated that they were currently showcasing works from the 'Calligraphy contest.' This was why Keiki had decided to go here on their date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today is the last day they have this in their exhibit, right? I'm glad that we managed to get here in time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you know of that, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A certain vice president told me. She's the one responsible for everything club-related."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she had shamelessly tried to take Keiki's undergarments after knocking him out cold, she still was kind enough to tell him this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But to think that you actually get the special prize… Sayuki-senpai really is amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This time I actually won, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's so awesome. You should've told me earlier about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But I didn't want to seem like an arrogant girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't think of you that way. After all, whenever Mizuha got a good grade in a test, she would always come running and say 'Praise me praise me!'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels a bit weird being compared to your little sister, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are conscious about the weirdest things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… is not the case, maybe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There are actually a lot of people who feel weird being praised, and don't know how to react to it. But Sayuki herself said that she was happy whenever she was praised by her Senpais. That basically screamed out that she's the kind of person who wants to be praised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that Sayuki-senpai really worked hard," He slowly started patting her on the head. "You really worked hard…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah." The girl softly nodded and closed her eyes. Both embarrassment and happiness mixed into one smile. "Fufu. Being disciplined is good and all, but being praised isn't all that bad either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I do like the teasing Master, I also love the kind one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… thanks for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">When the word 'love' popped up in their calm conversation, Keiki was shaken. Though he did know that what she felt wasn't a feeling of love, but merely her feelings for her master, he still couldn't help but recall the words from the love letter. He knew that he shouldn't be getting excited about it still, but he couldn't stop himself from harbouring expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew that she was a pervert, but he couldn't stop the blood rushing to his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There's something I want to ask you, Senpai. Why did you decide to make me your master?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why she chose Keiki, and not anyone else. After all, he was just a normal boy, with no outstanding capabilities.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why would she be so obsessed with Keiki-?</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she is still holding some sort of special affection towards him?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that I'm not normal. A woman who gets happy when boys do hideous things to her is more than just abnormal. So is someone who wants to actually become a pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I continued to hide it from everyone except my family. Of course, from Keiki-kun as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never suspected that Sayuki-senpai was a hardcore masochist."</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought that her most prominent points were her teasing attitude and her talent for calligraphy. She had the looks of an unobtainable flower, and at times the attitude of a child.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who would think that such a girl was actually a hardcore perverted masochist?</p>
<p class="null-p">"The trigger was probably when Keiki-kun joined the calligraphy club. Since you always showed your face in the club room, I started opening up to you I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could completely understand that feeling. It was the same feeling that Keiki held towards her this past year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that maybe if it's Keiki-kun, he might actually accept the real me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sadly, I'm normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like it, yes. But I do think that having a girl like me as your pet might have its benefits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't need those abnormal benefits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it does seem like I was a bit too hasty with my confession. It seems like I'd gotten the wrong impression."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………It seems like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the impression that Keiki would accept Sayuki's fetish, she had showed him her real identity. And even though she knows that it was nothing more than a misunderstanding, she still is keen to make Keiki her master.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't regret saying that I want to make Keiki-kun my master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if the trigger was a mere misunderstanding, my heart always wanted you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even after you found out about my fetish, you still stayed in the calligraphy club, right? I was worried that I would be all alone again, and I was really happy that you stayed with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">As she tried to put her feelings into words, she broadly smiled and said the following phrase:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even now, I still want Keiki-kun to be my owner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, seeing Sayuki's expression with these words was a bullet that shot Keiki right through the chest. Sayuki's smile was just so cute, so charming, and as sweet as honey.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her name was the first one to come up as a potential Cinderella candidate. And as the result of his investigation, he found out that she was a pervert. At the time, Keiki had thought that Sayuki only wanted to become his pet, and didn't hold any sort of actual affection towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">But was it really like that? Would she really be able to show such a smile if that were the only reason? Kissing Keiki on the cheek, and showing him her belly; maybe Tokihara Sayuki really was his Cinderella? Or was she really only acting as a pet? Whatever it was, there was no way for Keiki to find out just by thinking about it. After all, only the girl herself knew the answer to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai, uhm-"</p>
<p class="null-p">How does Tokihara Sayuki feel about Kiryuu Keiki?</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he went to ask for her answer to that question, an announcement inside the hall informed them that the building would soon close for the day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like it's time to go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The atmosphere for asking the question had completely vanished. But the flower-like smile that Sayuki had showed him was engraved inside his brain, and it continued to bloom even now.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_02_17.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The diary entry of Sayuki and her master's date:</p>
<p class="null-p">Today I went on a date with Keiki-kun to an amusement park. He said that he would become my master for a day. He really was wonderful. He forced me to ride a roller coaster against my will, forced me to erotically eat a hot dog in front of so many other people. When we rode the Ferris wheel, he told me to lick his finger as an apology for jumping on him earlier. Because he lost consciousness, I gave him a lap pillow. I was really happy when he treated me coldy. And, he praised me for my calligraphy work. He even patted me on the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">But to think that he would do something like that after our date… I once more learned that Keiki-kun really is a boy. On the way home, he pulled me to a deserted place, and gave me a very embarrassing order. Today's Keikikun was my master. As his pet, orders were absolute. Because of that, I did what he asked off me. I was so embarrassed that I thought my head would burn up. But, at the same time, uhm, I actually felt good too. Even though it was my first time, it still turned into an important experience for me. A lot of different feelings gathered, making a mix inside my heart, and it feels like I won't be able to sleep tonight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, what face should I make when I meet Keiki-kun tomorrow.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">After the date, Keiki and Sayuki started to make their way home. After exiting their train at the usual station, Sayuki looked up at the sky and stretched. This would normally be a problem because of her big breasts, but the people around her didn't seem to care, so Keiki decided to enjoy the view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you so much for today. I really had fun," Sayuki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that. Something like this really isn't bad from time to time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then will you walk me with a collar and leash next time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">But he did do her a huge favor today, and he had learned something about her past, so Keiki decided to call this day a success.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's gotten pretty late, so I'll walk you home," Keiki offered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my job to look after my pet until the very end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can we hold hands?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure. Here."</p>
<p class="null-p">They connected their hands just like they had that morning, and the girl once more smiled happily. Though she was a pervert most of the time, there were moments when Keiki thought that it might be okay if it was her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe giving in to her might not be so bad after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he certainly would not make her his pet. He wanted to experience love with a normal girl. That was Keiki's dream. But if Keiki managed to successfully reform Sayuki, he might be able to achieve his dream with her. To people passing by them, they must have looked like a normal couple. As for Keiki, it felt like he saw even more charming points to Sayuki than he knew existed. He thought that it shouldn't be too hard to turn her back into a normal girl. Though he would have to find out if Sayuki really was his Cinderella first.</p>
<p class="null-p">While the two of them were walking down the street, a huge car drove past them, followed by a gust of wind. In response, Sayuki held down her skirt agan.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's been really conscious about her skirt…</p>
<p class="null-p">During their time in the amusement park, she was constantly checking her skirt. Such as when she was riding the roller coaster, or when the girl with the wand passed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The normal Sayuki wouldn't care if someone were to catch a glimpse of her panties. So basically, there was a reason why she hated the idea of having her panties seen. And the possibility that this reason was connected to 'Cinderella's panties' was quite high.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Senpai, come with me for a sec."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki pulled Sayuki to a nearby park, with no people around. Underneath the dim glow of an electric light, he steeled his resolve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, what's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's something I would like to ask of Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I look under your skirt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fue?!" The girl's shoulders jumped when she heard these words.</p>
<p class="null-p">To affirm her Kouhai's orders, she looked up at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that a no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'd be embarrassed, you know…" She squirmed a bit as she voiced her resistance.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been asked to show her panties to a member of the opposite sex. That was a completely normal reaction. However, Keiki had a certain trump card in his hands today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today, Sayuki-senpai is my pet, right? You're not going to listen to your Master's orders?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!" Hearing the magic words, Sayuki's face stiffened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, Keiki was Sayuki's master. He had the ability to order anything of this big breasted, cute Onee-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Under…stood…" She hesitatingly put her hands on her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">With quivering lips, she slowly started lifting it up. Her face was as red as a ripe tomato.</p>
<p class="null-p">Uhm… somehow, this feels exciting since we're doing something immoral…</p>
<p class="null-p">And here was a boy who was calmly watching it happen. He had completely become a sadist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mhm…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When her panties were almost visible, she stopped her hands. She looked straight at Keiki. But her master just tilted his head and waited for her to continue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tears started welling up in Sayuki's eyes. As if she had given up, she pulled up her skirt all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, let's find out if Sayuki really is Cinderella!</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything below the girl's belly was completely visible, and she averted her gaze with trembling shoulders. Keiki looked at her lower body with serious eyes. There was no way that he would forget what Cinderella's panties looked like. If Sayuki was wearing these panties, it would mean that she was the one who wrote the love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Let's start with the conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't figure out if Sayuki was actually Cinderella or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Why?</p>
<p class="null-p">Because the underwear that should be visible was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't wear them…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki didn't wear Cinderella's panties. No, she didn't wear any panties at all. Tokihara Sayuki showed Keiki her most important place. Luckily, the dim electric light prevented Keiki from seeing much, and it also greatly helped that Keiki was staring into nothingness, completely lost as to what was happening.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, the no-panties Sayuki started giggling with flushed cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I didn't wear any the whole day. The entire time, I was so excited by the mere thought that someone might be able to see."</p>
<p class="null-p">That explained why she had been so conscious of her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time when she rode the roller coaster.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time when she gave Keiki a lap pillow on the bench.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when they had that good atmosphere when they talked in the calligraphy exhibition, she wasn't wearing any panties. While Keiki's brain was having trouble keeping up, the abnormal girl continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even know, I was really embarrassed, thinking that you would see everything, but I also got really excited."</p>
<p class="null-p">So Keiki's guess was only half right. Be it Cinderella's panties, or no panties at all, she had tried her best so that Keiki wouldn't be able to see. It seemed like Keiki underestimated the masochistic side of Sayuki. This black-haired Cinderella candidate was an even bigger pervert than the prince had imagined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki-kun?" She called out to him with an erotic voice. "What should we do - after this?" Her soft-looking lips slightly vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks were colored bright red, and her watery eyes looked at Keiki with an expectant gaze, in this deserted park at this hour.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should they do in this situation?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the virgin prince knew what would follow next, and he was unable to distance himself from her. With that, their date went into overtime.</p>
<p class="null-h2">To be continue...</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">Here we are again with the second volume of 'HenSuki'. This time around, I've added another perverted ingredient. Did you like it?</p>
<p class="null-p">A new character entered the stage, there's new information about Cinderella, the heroines were perverts through and through, and of course, that epilogue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Barely safe, you could call it? The story will continue in the 3rd installment.</p>
<p class="null-p">What will happen between Sayuki and Keiki?</p>
<p class="null-p">Who is the Cinderella who dropped her panties?</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot of questions remain, but will they be answered in the next volume?</p>
<p class="null-p">I sincerely hope that you are looking forward to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, I wanted to address some of the happy moments that occured</p>
<p class="null-p">after the release of volume 1 of 'HenSuki'. Immediately after the release, a reprint was confirmed. The ratings have gone up on diverse light novel sites.</p>
<p class="null-p">And I have received a lot of different positive feedback.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no bigger joy as a writer than seeing so many people actually enjoying the book that I wrote. It really feels great, knowing that so many people support me. So as to not betray their trust, I will work even harder from now on.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now, my thanks.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, Sune-sensei has drawn fantastic illustrations as well, and I thank you very much for that. The color illustration of Mizuha in all her glory was magnificent. For people like me, who especially focus on the waist, it was the best reward ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the people who helped me release this installment, and to the readers who actually picked it up, I cannot thank you enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, I hope that we can see each other again in the third volume.</p>
