<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a normal Sunday during the latter half of the month, and the time was just past 9pm in the evening. After finishing her shower, Airi changed into her warm set of clothes and headed back to her own room with her hair down, yawning all the way. Since she had completed all of her homework, she could now completely focus on writing her yuri novel. Right when she made it near the colorful box that she used as a shelf, she realized that the light on her smartphone, laying on the desk, was blinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, an email from Ayano-senpai and Mitani…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The people who had contacted her were members of the same student council as Airi, namely Fujimoto Ayano and Mitani Rin. With a Ladies First mentality, she decided to check Ayano's email first.</p>
<p class="null-p">'As of late, I can't recharge on Kiryuu-kun's scent at all… Sniff, sniff…'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as troublesome of an email as ever. What kind of reaction was Airi supposed to have towards her smell-fetishist friend?</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's a great Senpai, but sometimes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Most of the time she's diligent and reliable, but not when she acts like a pervert. That being said, Airi still greatly respected her senior. Trying not to sound rude, she answered with a 'You can do it! It's just for a short while, I'm sure!', and sent it. After that, she checked the email from her fellow first- year Mitani.</p>
<p class="null-p">'What should I do to win over a senior girl whose breasts are much larger than they look at first?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you asking me that? You're as disgusting as ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly speaking, that wasn't exactly an email you should send to a female classmate. Airi didn't know who he was talking about, nor did she particularly care about Mitani's relationship status. She would have preferred to ignore it completely, but knowing him, he would pressure her until she eventually replied. She decided on a short 'Perverts from the planet of Boobs should go back where they came from.' Praying that no reply would come, she put the smartphone away again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For crying out loud, that Mitani…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that awful email, her refreshed mood from right after the bath had been completely ruined. Men with no delicacy are the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. I wonder how Yuika is doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she didn't care about Mitani in the slightest, Yuika's current love progress was far more interesting to Airi. Koga Yuika was another one of Airi's classmates, as well as a good friend. She had one-sided feelings for a boy in her calligraphy club, Kiryuu Keiki, and Airi was supporting her endeavours.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A month has gone by without her receiving a response to her confession. Kiryuu-senpai cannot be forgiven…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't be blamed for feeling resentful. After Airi's friend put her heart into a confession during Christmas Eve, that man had kept it on hold for such a long time. To Airi, who deeply adored Yuika, this was something that made her blood boil in anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, no matter how dense that Senpai may be, if Yuika goes on the offensive, he'll fall easily enough, I'm sure." She commented. She took out a picture from her desk drawer.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a picture taken for the school's pamphlet, with the help of Ootori Koharu. It showed Yuika and Keiki standing next to each other in front of the school. Yuika was blushing ever so slightly as she glanced at her Senpai's</p>
<p class="null-p">profile, smiling happily…</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad. Yuika really is an angel…" She subconsciously said out loud.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was truly cute. This statement was true at any given point in time, but when she had the expression of a maiden in love, her cuteness reached lethal status, making Airi feel like her heart was about to burst open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since she's this cute, winning over some random boy should be easy, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even to Airi, a member of the same sex, this level of cuteness couldn't be understated. It should be deadly for any boy out there. What other choice would that Senpai have besides going out with her?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure that Kiryuu-senpai will fall in love with Yuika…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she had no way of knowing what answer he would give, but if you ignore Yuika's sadistic side, then she's practically perfect. No boy should be able to resist when she whispers love into his ear. Of course, Airi still was a bit hesitant about letting Yuika go out with a boy, but as long as she was happy, that's all that mattered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They should just go out…" She said, pressing her finger against the boy's face in the picture.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as he gave the OK, these two could become happy. It didn't seem too unfortunate to snatch such a beauty like Yuika from the boy's point of view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Giving the boy in the picture another flick to the head, Airi heard her phone vibrate. When she picked it up, she saw that an email had come from her beloved angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From Yuika. Was there some development?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It would make sense. The members of the calligraphy club went on a trip to the snowy mountains yesterday, so there was a high chance that something</p>
<p class="null-p">could have happened to the two. Grinning to herself, she opened up the email.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when she read the content of the email, her expression froze. 'Yuika was rejected by Keiki-senpai today.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You're kidding me."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, the email was about Yuika's current love situation, but the words written inside spelled the ending of love, not the beginning.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: Yuika's Revenge</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, Keiki finished his dinner and sat on the sofa in his living room, just gazing into the void. Naturally, he was thinking about the time when he gave his response to Yuika's confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the library office's storage room, he told her that he had feelings for someone else, and the girl answered with a brief 'Is that so…?' and left the room. Back then, Keiki couldn't decipher the expression she showed. Was she angry or sad? She might have even been crying, for all he knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was what I did really right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe he could have rejected her a bit more kindly? …No, getting her hopes up when the answer was decided would only have been crueler. Being considerate when you can't accept a girl's feelings is just irresponsible. And yet, Keiki couldn't help but feel regretful. After all, the other person was his cute junior.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had mentally prepared herself for the fact that she might be crying when he rejected her. But he kept thinking that he wanted to keep their current relationship, and that he didn't want her to hate him. Of course, he hated himself for wishing this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All you handsome bastards in this world, how can you deal with this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Had Shouma, who had been confessed to dozens of times, gone through the same feelings each time? No, probably not. The reason rejecting Yuika's confession hurt so much-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's because she was that serious about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Out of all the people who had confessed to Shouma, most of them weren't</p>
<p class="null-p">even in love with him, and just tried their luck, so to speak. However, Yuika was different. She was ready to even throw away her own interests in order to be liked by Keiki. She was prepared to practically sacrifice herself in order to win over the boy she loved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I also…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Christmas date was the first time he had noticed, but with many back and forths, Keiki realized that he had someone he loved from the bottom of his heart as well. And these feelings definitely weren't any less strong than Yuika's feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Nii-san?" "Mizuha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki raised his head, his little sister was standing in front of him. She was wearing a thick sweater with a skirt. She took a peek at her brother's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you making that complicated face for?" "I was just thinking about something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking about what?" Mizuha thought about it for a second. "Hmmm…" She then clapped her hands together. "I see! You were thinking of lifting up your sister's skirt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not in the slightest."</p>
<p class="null-p">How could she even say that with a serious expression? It was so different from how she usually acted, and it still surprised Keiki every time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you saying that you have no interest in your little sister's panties?" "It'd be really bad if I did, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't that common sense? However, Mizuha didn't seem to feel that way. She let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I put on some erotic black panties today, but I guess you're not interested…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wearing that!?" "I went all out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your older brother can't exactly appreciate that, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then…" She grabbed the hem of her skirt, lifting it up to where she was just barely not showing her panties, and flashed a provocative smile. "Would you like to check what kind of panties they are?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You damn pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, that's to be expected from the exhibitionist who had 'No-panties days'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally I'd just ignore her, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, the circumstances were different.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did say I was ready to accept even Yuika-chan's perverted side, so…</p>
<p class="null-p">This had happened a few hours prior. When talking to his junior in the storage room, Keiki said that the girls' fetishes were something similar to how he liked big breasts, so they shouldn't force themselves to change. He had announced it so proudly, so going back on his word would make him feel even more awful. Denying Mizuha's fetish would mean that he had betrayed Yuika's feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then let me have a look." "Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so shocked? Didn't you bring this up yourself?" "T-That's true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Stop fidgeting and show me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you get so aggressive all of a sudden!? …I'm happy, but if you want to see them so badly, you can just ask whenever. Nii-san is so lewd~" She smiled happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki however really wanted to complain about who the lewd one was.</p>
<p class="null-p">I put the 'De-Perversion' plan on ice, but is it really okay to let a pervert like her roam free?</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe he made up his mind too quickly after all. But for now, he decided to focus on the underwear check. He wouldn't be able to rest easy either way. As it turned out, she was wearing slightly lewd black panties, just as she had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How… are they?" She asked bashfully with her skirt lifted up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're safe to wear at home, but I can't allow you to go to school with them. If another boy were to see them…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll only show my panties to you, though!" "So you've said before, but…"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_6.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">As they had this nonchalant exchange, he couldn't help but smile. Mizuha fixed her skirt and smiled as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like you're feeling better now, Nii-san." "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You had a super-conflicted expression earlier." "Hm…" He put his hand to his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was being considerate as usual. Maybe she had put on those panties to cheer Keiki up, even?</p>
<p class="null-p">"So since you're feeling better, how about we take a bath together?" "I humbly decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">Let me retract my previous statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">This pervert merely wanted to show off her lewd underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning, Kiryuu." "Ahh, hey Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning, Keiki was busy putting on his indoor shoes when Mao appeared and called out to him. Her reddish-brown hair was tied up in the usual side-tail, and she was wearing a coat and scarf above her uniform. This morning, it was cold enough to almost freeze your fingers. After stuffing her gloves away, Mao started changing her shoes as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, did you do your math homework?" She asked. "Ah, I forgot we had homework."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You too? I guess Akiyama will have to show me his later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, good idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And thus, Kiryuu paid with his own body for the homework."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not add weird narration to things first thing in the morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging from that, she had probably been up all night working on her BL manga. Right as the two started to walk to their classroom-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-senpai…" "Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki met eyes with Koga Yuika, who had just entered the building as well. Just like Mao, she was wearing a coat with a scarf, and she awkwardly averted her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Morning, Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" Yuika just silently turned and walked away quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a pretty obvious rejection. When he saw this reaction, Keiki felt a sharp pain assault his chest, worse than any punishment he had suffered previously.</p>
<p class="null-p">That sure hurt…</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving a cold reaction from his beloved junior was tougher than he could have imagined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, did you do something to Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouldn't that be 'Did something happen between the two of you'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, knowing you and your nonexistent sense of delicacy, I don't need to ask that. You probably called her 'flat-chested' or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm pretty sure you're the one being rude right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">If the person herself heard that, she'd be the target of Yuika's anger instead. "Also, Yuika-chan has more than it looks like." He said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, compared to the other members of the calligraphy club, she was clearly lacking, but when he got a good hold of them before, they offered more than he previously assumed. It was clear that she was working hard chasing after Mao and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmmm? So she actually has more than she seems, huh?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki turned his face sideways, Mao met him with an ice-cold glare. "So how exactly do you know that, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only then did he realize that he had dug his own grave. From the way he said that, it was clear as day that he had copped a feel of them before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, whatever. If you're having a fight, then make up already." "…Right."</p>
<p class="null-p">They weren't exactly fighting, but he couldn't just say that Yuika had confessed, either. Thus, he merely nodded along.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan really isn't coming, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">During lunch break that day, Keiki sat at the library counter for his job as a library committee member, all alone. Although it was her turn today as well, Yuika did not appear. As a result, the chair next to him was empty. Just thinking about all the times his junior had smiled at him as they talked, Keiki started to lose his motivation to work.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be fair, the traffic wasn't all too overwhelming right now, so he could do all the work just fine, but things could turn problematic if this situation</p>
<p class="null-p">continued for longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What if she doesn't show up to the club, either?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was entirely possible. Unlike her position as a committee member, clubs are things you can quit on a whim. All the more so if you keep in mind that she had only joined in order to make Keiki her slave. Now that she had been rejected, and lost her motivation to make him her slave, she had no reason to remain in the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess it's selfish of me to want her to stay in the club…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, when he remembered the conversations they had, and the fun they had shared together, he thought all of them were precious memories. He didn't want things to end up like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-kun-senpai, good work today!" "Ah, Rintarou… Wait, hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A boy, Mitani Rin, walked towards the counter, wearing his male uniform. Next to him was another boy familiar to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hello, Kiryuu-senpai…" "Um… aren't you Chouno?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes, that's me." He affirmed Keiki's assumption, bowing slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was a first-year like Rintarou, and a member of the manga research club. "Why are you two together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chouno-kun and I became friends. We talked during the election, and our hobbies lined up. After all, he's a fellow reader of 'ShameCom'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, 'ShameCom."</p>
<p class="null-p">ShameCom is a manga that's particularly popular with middle school</p>
<p class="null-p">students. Its full name is 'Is it shameless to hope for a romcom in a different world?', and it tells the story of a protagonist who gets into lewd accidents with the heroines. Keiki had read it before, and he enjoyed it quite a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, Kiryuu-senpai. I'm very sorry about what happened during the election…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san forgave you, and I'm not particularly angry either."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was one of the few people who had caused a bit of trouble during the elections in order to try to damage Ayano's popularity, but that had been taken care of already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, how is everyone from the club doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… Now that Megu-senpai became the student council vice president and started showing up to our club less, we're a bit out of motivation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes sense. Onizuka-san was basically your club's idol."</p>
<p class="null-p">'Megu-senpai' was Onizuka Megumi. She was Keiki's classmate, a member of the manga research club, and also the vice president of the student council. She had been scouted by Ayano, and was currently awfully busy with her work, which was why her manga research club activities were suffering as a result.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that can't be helped. Megu-senpai was the only one who really brought the club together, and we're not exactly coming up with any new ideas either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Onizuka-san came up with that, didn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since their main creative mind had left, they obviously hadn't come up with any new ideas for manga. It seems like that was having a pretty negative influence on the motivation of the manga research club's members.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But she looks like she's having fun, and she's got a boyfriend taking care of her, so I'm more than satisfied."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, they went on a Christmas date too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Onizuka-san was currently going out with the third-year Inui Naoya, and they were spending a lovey-dovey high school life together. Of course she wouldn't have time to check in on the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of dates, listen to this, Kei-kun-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was enjoying his conversation with Chouno, Rintarou suddenly cut in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I ran into Mizuha-senpai in the hallway just now, but when I invited her out to drink some tea together, she said she had some natto sale that she had to worry about and declined."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You still haven't given up, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I haven't. I won't stop until I bury my face between those honkers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not fantasize about someone else's little sister like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He might have had a peaceful face, but that bastard was actually rotten to the core.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't hand over Mizuha to someone who's only in it for the breasts." "Ahaha, you're as much of a siscon as always, Kei-kun-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll take that as a compliment."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been told as much many times as of late, so he had gotten used to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't get the wrong idea, though. It's not that I'm only in it for the breasts. It's rare that you find a girl as great as her. She's good at cooking, beautiful, and kind. It's like a Goddess has descended to earth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A goddess, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Clearly, Rintarou was under the wrong impression that Kiryuu Mizuha was an average girl. Of course, from an objective point of view, Mizuha definitely was cute. Her breasts definitely were her big charm point, clothed or not, her cooking and cleaning skills were second to none, and she had a very gentle personality. However, she also had a hidden status that should never be revealed to anyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder how he'd react if he saw Mizuha force her older brother to check her underwear like that…</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, she was a pervert who loved walking around with no panties on. She was the exact opposite of the term 'prim and proper.' Even though that was the case, Keiki couldn't tell Rintarou about this, as the knowledge of it would spread like a wildfire.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-You seem to be having quite a bit of fun, Kiryuu-senpai." "Ah, Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There's quite a lot of people visiting the library today, Keiki thought. After Rintarou and Chouno, now even the first-year Nagase Airi-san had showed up. As always, her beige hair was tied up in twin-tails, and she wasn't even trying to hide her bad mood. On reflex, the two boys in her way took their distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could I have a bit of your time?" "Right now? I'm on duty, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika wasn't here either, so he couldn't just skip out on work. However, Airi directed her gaze over towards Rintarou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about this, but could you take over for a moment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me!?" Rintarou, who had no experience working as a library committee</p>
<p class="null-p">member, protested loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi ignored his protests and dragged Keiki with her out of the library room.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After walking for a while, they came to the student council office. Since the door was open, they immediately went inside, and Airi spoke up after having been quiet the entire way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You probably know what I'm about to say, right?" "Well, about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard you rejected Yuika." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she brought up that topic, Keiki's expression tightened. She sounded like she had figured something like this could happen. When she talked to him at the end of the previous year, at that certain cafe, it sounded like he might just have another girl he was interested in-and not Yuika. Even so, it was Yuika. If she simply became serious, winning over such an ordinary boy would be an easy feat-or so Airi thought, but in the end, Yuika wasn't chosen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a liar. You said you wouldn't make her cry." "I'm sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Playboy. Enemy of all women. Dull protagonist." "Aren't you taking it a bit too far there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't you think about it one more time? There's still a chance that-" "I know, but I can't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I have someone I like." "!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had expected something along those lines, but hearing it from him was still quite a shock. However, she could not be shaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that person cuter than Yuika?" "In my eyes, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way a girl cuter than Yuika could exist, you know!?" "Then what am I supposed to say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't good. She was letting her emotions get the better of her. She didn't want to be like this in front of him, but her anger got the better of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought it was weird. Why did you go that far for Yuika-chan's sake, Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…" She hesitated for a bit, but eventually spoke again. "You know how much of a lone wolf she was back when she first started attending the school here, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she was alone in the library pretty often."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, I knew what she was going through, but I couldn't help her through it. Well, I tried talking to her a few times, but she never really bothered interacting with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, Yuika would reject whoever tried talking to her, no matter what they said. As a result, Airi failed to save Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the reason I wanted to support her love. It's not going to erase my guilt, but I at least wanted her to enjoy her school life with the person she loved."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The power of love is amazing, isn't it? Even a girl like her could become this cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika seemed like an angel when she was with Kiryuu Keiki. When she heard about it, Airi felt jealous of the upperclassmen who managed to make the girl smile, which was something she couldn't do. He had saved Yuika alone. That's why Airi was so desperate to get these two together.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she can be happy, then I'm ready to support her with everything I have.</p>
<p class="null-p">She always felt that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet-</p>
<p class="null-p">Any more than this was impossible. Her reason was screaming for her to not think any further. Her head felt dizzy, and right when she was about to be sucked down into the dark abyss, a warm hand was placed on her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu-senpai, what are you doing?" "Rubbing your head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can tell that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was unable to understand why he would do that right now. Not to mention that he was smiling, and he said the following.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are kind, Nagase-san." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd go that far for a friend of yours. I think you're pretty amazing." "…I'm not kind at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">He could only say that because he didn't know anything. If he knew what she felt, he would be devastated. And yet-</p>
<p class="null-p">Why do I feel so happy…?</p>
<p class="null-p">She found herself unable to brush away his hand, and she just gave in to this gentle feeling. She knew that this was equivalent to betraying Yuika. Even so, her face started to burn up, and right when she started thinking about what she always avoided, Keiki opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You resemble the person I have feelings for, Nagase-san." "Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, your personality is different, but I just can't leave her alone. Just like you, she works her hardest for other people, and treasures other people's feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The latter half of what Keiki said didn't even reach Airi's ears. Sadness, pain, and many more emotions that had no name tampered with her heart, leaving her head blank. Before she realized it, she had brushed away Keiki's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave…" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enough. Just leave…!" "Didn't you bring me here!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring her senior's confusion, Airi just pushed him out of the room, closing the door after him. She could hear his complaints from the outside, but these were eventually followed up by his footsteps growing more distant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Confirming this, Airi pressed her forehead against the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I resemble the person he likes, I'm out of the question, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the reason she had thrown Keiki out so aggressively. Because she felt betrayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not kind at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That boy seemed to have the wrong idea, but Nagase Airi was actually the worst kind of human being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all… for Kiryuu-senpai, I actually…" It happened when she was about to admit everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">A rummaging sound came from the inside of the room, which should normally be empty, together with a flustered 'Ah!?' voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who!?" Airi screamed, and turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">She spotted a mobile game console dropped to the floor next to the sofa, and a female student peeking from beneath it-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shiho-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yahallo~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">How long had she been there? Judging from the situation, she probably tried to pick up the console from the ground, when Airi and Keiki stormed into the room, which left her unable to come out-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you here, Shiho-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, well…" Shiho stood up with a troubled expression, taking the console with her. "Y-You know, I wanted to keep playing that new game I got into, and thought I would borrow the room here, but then you two suddenly came in, so I had to hide… I didn't mean to eavesdrop, so please don't be angry, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, she had been enjoying a game here in this room. Now that Airi thought about it, she would hide in here and play games pretty often when the student council was busy. Normally, Airi would give her an earful for it, but now she lacked the energy to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were… listening?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, I heard everything." Shiho nodded awkwardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It made perfect sense, since this room wasn't necessarily big or anything. Of course, that meant she must have heard Airi's muttering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you like Keiki-kun, Airi-chan?" "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She considered hiding it, but quickly realized that it would be futile. Now that her feelings had been heard, it was already too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's right, I've always been attracted to Kiryuu-senpai." She blurted out all of the feelings she tried to hide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's weird, isn't it? I kept going on and on about how much I hated men, and avoided them…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of a past trauma, she didn't want anything to do with men. She was quite harsh with Keiki in the beginning, as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's just too kind for his own good. He constantly meddles with other people's business, and worked with me all day and night to cure my hatred of men. I've never met someone as weird as him."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what Airi said to him, he never left her alone. At first, she had merely been curious about him, tracing him with her eyes, until she eventually started thinking about him at home. But by then it was already too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai has someone he likes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Him telling her that she resembled this person was too cruel for her to bear. She was painfully reminded that she was not special in his eyes. After making Airi think about him 24/7, after making her unable to be without him, he had just gone and fallen in love with someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why isn't it Yuika? Why can't it be me?</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew that she was being unfair. It wasn't his fault, nor was it anyone else's. She herself had chosen not to pursue that path.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was really hard for me… Even though I decided on it, I wanted to support Yuika… ignoring my own pain…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that she had started letting out her honest feelings, there was no stopping them anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really wanted to go on that date with Kiryuu-senpai during Christmas Eve… Walk through town with him, maybe even hold hands… The promise was supposed to be between the two of us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been happy to hear how he was looking forward to the date. When she received the present at the cafe, her chest burned up with joy. What would he think if he knew how much she gazed at that notebook every single day?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not as kind as Kiryuu-senpai thinks I am. Because when I heard that Yuika was rejected, before feeling sadness and grief for my friend… I felt relieved…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said she was doing it for Yuika's sake, but she still hadn't given up on the boy herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason I called him here was to convince him to accept Yuika's feelings so I could finally give up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that Yuika had been rejected, why had she even given up on him in the first place? And she felt guilt for being relieved. But even her final attempt ended in failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What can I do when he tells me that he has someone he likes? I know better than anyone that you can't just stop those feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't want him to go through the same feelings she had. She didn't want him to shoulder the pressure and pain of not being able to confess to the person you like.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sure I'd just be a bother even if I confessed now…</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why she chased him out of the room before she could make any mistakes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see. So that's what was going on." "Shiho-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi raised her head, only to be embraced by Shiho. "You did great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No more words were needed. Airi just buried her face inside Shiho's chest, crying like a child.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_7.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Classes came to an end that day, and while Keiki was walking down the hallway after cleaning the classroom, his smartphone vibrated inside his pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? It's from Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she wasn't done complaining at him yet? With these thoughts, he opened the message.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Yuika collapsed and was taken to the infirmary.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, he failed to grasp the words he just read. Only the part about Yuika having collapsed repeated over and over in his head, sending emergency signals up to his brain, his blood freezing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shit!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he didn't know the circumstances, staying still was not an option. Before he could think, Keiki started running, moving through the empty hallways, jumping inside the infirmary on the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan-"</p>
<p class="null-p">The school nurse Tachibana-sensei seemed to be out. However, of the two beds, one was hidden by the curtains.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fuu… Ah… Mmm… Nnn…" He heard a girl's suffering (?) voice from behind it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He pulled open the curtains and moved inside, only to find Yuika sitting on the bed, blinking in confusion-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki himself suffered from a similar reaction. The scene in front of him left him speechless. The girl had taken off her blazer and was groping her breasts with both her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-senpai!?" Her face turned as red as a tomato in a matter of seconds, and she started screaming. "W-Why are you here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right back at you… What are you doing?" "T-This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you doing something this indecent at school…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No!?" When Keiki gave her a doubtful gaze, Yuika frantically removed her hands. "This isn't what you think it is!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why were you fondling your breasts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… Ugh…" The girl resigned herself to it and screamed. "This is a method to make Yuika's chest grow! Tachibana-sensei told her about this! Do you have a problem with that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I'm at fault here, so put that pillow down, would you?" He quickly retreated from the landmine he was about to step on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, it felt like he already stepped on it, but at the very least, the pillow wasn't thrown after him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seriously, what is that nurse telling her students…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she was quite well-endowed as well, it was probably easier for Yuika to fall victim to her nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yuika already knows that it's too late." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A man wouldn't understand our feelings, hmph." She put her blazer back on, buttoned up the front, and sat on the side of the bed. "So why are you here, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san told me that you collapsed, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Collapsed? No, Yuika was just lacking sleep, so she took the afternoon classes off…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?" Keiki inspected the girl more closely.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't seem sick or the like, nor did she have any injuries. That could only mean-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san set me up again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was probably so the two of them would end up alone together. "But Yuika is happy that you were this worried about her." "Well, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you rejected her yesterday." "Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, the reason Yuika was lacking sleep is because she was crying all night after you rejected her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His chest hurt unbearably. Her gaze stabbed him all over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you think that was a waste? A beauty like Yuika confessed to you, and you still said no."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't argue against that. Even now, he thought that it was a waste.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, what a shame. If Keiki-senpai were to become Yuika's boyfriend, she'd let you do whatever you wanted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever… I want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That sounded quite interesting. Although that thought was immediately destroyed by what Yuika said next.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like going on a walk with Senpai as Yuika's dog?" "I really don't want anything to do with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The only person who'd be happy about something like that would be Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that makes sense. Now that Yuika has been rejected, she only can move on to another love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Did you think she would really say that?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, everything just then was a lie! Yuika isn't giving up at all!" "Ehhh!?" Keiki was taken by surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is a sadistic queen, right? That's why there's no need for her to listen to Keiki-senpai's opinion. She will attack you whenever she wants, wherever she can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Doesn't that mean she will stay in the club?</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better be prepared. Yuika will make you hers, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll have to be careful from now on." A smile appeared on Keiki's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared as if Keiki's 'De-Perversion' plan had failed. She had no intentions of quitting. Yet, oddly enough, it didn't feel too bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Yuika and Keiki made their way to the clubroom, with the other three members had already gathered. Sayuki, Mao, and Mizuha sat around the table, looking up as the two entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Took you long enough," Sayuki said. "Good work today. What are you all doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We were looking at the pictures from the trip." "Wait, they're here already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It didn't take more than a day thanks to Ootori-san." "That's Koharu-senpai for you, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no person more reliable than that senior. Apparently, they had spread out the pictures already, and they scooted around the table to make room for the other two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go, Nii-san, Yuika-chan." "Let me see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, there's the picture of the snowman Mizuha-senpai made." Yuika pointed at a picture showing a happy snowman family.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were other pictures, like Yuika attempting her first time at skiing, Keiki teaching her, Mao sleeping, and Sayuki in her pajamas.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When did you take a picture of me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that was me. It looked cute, so I couldn't resist."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?" Mao loudly protested. It was the same club as usual. "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki glanced over, Yuika was smiling to herself, so he figured he didn't have to worry about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then…</p>
<p class="null-p">His response to Yuika had finally been dealt with, but there's still one more person waiting.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have to find some time to be alone with Sayuki-senpai…</p>
<p class="null-p">She was, just like everyone else, looking at the pictures and smiling. Keiki still had put the answer to her confession on hold. Although his answer had already been decided, he'd rather not say it in front of everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess I'll invite her on the way home…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was busy thinking about it, when the girl in question, Sayuki, called out to Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Koga-san, you were with Keiki-kun today, weren't you?" "Ah, Yuika had something to talk with him about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly?" "Well, the thing is-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki realized too late how evil Yuika's grin was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai apparently is willing to accept our perversions." "Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's words dropped like a bombshell, and everyone started to panic. "D-Does that mean we're allowed to show our fetishes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened to his De-Perversion plan?" "Is that true?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki, Mao, and even Mizuha looked over at Yuika. "That is the truth. Right, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He did say that he would respect their individualities. But never did he state that he would totally accept every single aspect of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, he said something else that was very interesting… "</p>
<p class="null-p">While everyone's gazes were focused on Keiki, Yuika flashed a grin and dropped another bomb.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It appears as if Keiki-senpai has someone he likes." "Someone he likes!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The voices of all three girls overlapped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, Yuika doesn't know who that is… Right, Senpai?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was just unfair. Keiki was unable to withstand the intense gazes of the three girls. He had to look away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Huh… Kiryuu has someone he likes. I see." "Just who might it be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san has someone he likes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao and the others started pondering who it could be. The calm atmosphere from before had vanished elsewhere. What was left was a mix of panic, excitement, and absolute craziness.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is going on here…?</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't a mood where he could think about his response to the confession. How did things even end up like this? Of all the people to find out, it had to be the girls from the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…" "Ehehe~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki gave Yuika an exhausted glare. She simply grinned and stuck her</p>
<p class="null-p">tongue out at him in a cute fashion.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: The Love in my Heart</p>
<p class="null-p">Around the time Keiki was wrapped up in the battlefield that was the calligraphy club, inside a room in the Akiyama Household, Yuuhi was sitting in her favorite chair, facing the desk as she grinned at her smartphone screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What'cha looking at?" "Gyaaaaah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice suddenly called out to her, which made her jump in shock, her hair standing on end like a cat's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Asahi-chan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who had scared the living hell out of Yuuhi was none other than her twin older sister, Akiyama Asahi, with her trademark short hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to say that was a great reaction." "D-Don't surprise me like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I have checked your panties, then?" "That wouldn't make it any better…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi's heart was still racing. Of course, the reason her heart almost leaped out of her chest was easily because of the picture she was looking at on her phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">D-Did she see? She probably did, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi asked herself these questions as she tightly embraced the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Depending on the answer to her question, she might have to take countermeasures.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That picture is from the event at the aquarium, right? When did you even take that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, so you did see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, Yuuhi was looking at a picture that showed the boy she held one- sided feelings for. During Christmas Eve last year, he participated in a princess-carry contest, and this was a picture of him during that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see~ So you were grinning because you were looking at Kei-kun's picture."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What about it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, her sister teased her about it. "Say, you're still not over him at all, right?" "Y-You're wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're finding yourself unable to forget the boy you had one-sided feelings for. You're probably one the purest bitches I've ever seen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was never a bitch to begin with, okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, you received that title because you bragged about your experience, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, Asahi-chan is a bully and I hate it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, sorry. You're just so cute that I couldn't help myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For crying out loud…" Yuuhi found herself unable to do anything but forgive her older sister when she clapped her hands together with a cute gesture. "Anyway, you're totally wrong. Kei-chan just healed my heart… and I'm satisfied just looking at him… He's like my favorite character from an</p>
<p class="null-p">anime, I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-kun's some kind of idol now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that Kei-chan has a girl he likes." "That's it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You still haven't spilled the beans. Who's the girl he likes? The one he went on a date with on Christmas Eve?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…" Yuuhi thought about it for a second, putting her index finger to her lips. "I'll keep it a secret for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Don't leave me hanging like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sheesh. Alright then, I'll give you a hint." Yuuhi let out a sigh and continued. "That girl loves Kei-chan the most in the entire world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? That's it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think I'm wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't help me at all, though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is your punishment for teasing your cute little sister." "No way!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No more bonus hints came from Yuuhi. She made a wry smile and looked at the picture on her phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder what Kei-chan is doing right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Kei-chan, also known as Kiryuu Keiki, was currently in a predicament.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was unnecessary, okay? How can you tie me up like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuika let loose that bombshell of an announcement, Keiki was immediately tied to his chair. While he was unable to move, the four female club members stood around him, fixing him with intense glares. This treatment was practically criminal, but nobody was around to report it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, how unsightly. It looks great on you, Keiki-senpai~" "Why thank you." Keiki glared at the sadistic girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">If possible, he wanted to break free of this bondage and spank the girl in retaliation. However, it was impossible for him to break free.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, who's the girl you like, Kiryuu? Depending on your answer, I might not be able to forgive you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, if you don't spit it out soon, we'll be forced to tease you some." "Eeeeeeek!?" Mao and Yuika approached him, and Keiki let out a shriek.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of their eyes were bloodshot. They were breathing like wild beasts that had found prey. At this rate, Keiki would be tortured beyond his ability to endure. He would be stripped of his clothes, be forced to gulp down freshly- worn panties, and be suffocated by breasts. These freaks would be willing to do all kinds of things like that. When he remembered all the situations he had gone through thus far, Keiki's entire body started quivering in fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mizuha…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If they gag me, it's all over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing this, Keiki sought help from his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">She'll definitely help me, right!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like how Keiki was a siscon, Mizuha was quite a brocon herself. She surely wouldn't cast aside her beloved big brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I want to know, too." "Mizuhaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the bonds of siblings were not strong enough to win against curiosity. Keiki was forced to realize that there was no ally to be found in this room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, Keiki-senpai." "Resign yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'll be much easier if you just tell us, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, Mao, and now even Mizuha were steadily moving in on Keiki. At this rate, his chastity will be in grave danger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, why don't we stop this? Keiki-kun doesn't look like he likes this…" "Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the midst of this precarious situation, the person who put a stop to things was Sayuki, who had been watching this all unfold from a safe distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's quite rare for you to act like this, Witch-senpai. Normally you'd be leading the charge."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That might be true, but…" When Yuika pointed that out, Sayuki started fumbling over her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, even Keiki had expected her to join the fray.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it because I still haven't given her a response to her confession?</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever the response may be, maybe she didn't want Keiki to confess his beloved one right here. However, Yuika had no way of knowing these feelings, thus she remained wary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something is off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Not at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm?" She gave Sayuki a dubious gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, she just muttered "Well, that doesn't matter." to herself and once again looked over at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let Yuika change the question." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, is the girl you like one of the people present right now?" "Wha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That question was seriously bad. No matter his response, he wouldn't get out of here safely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki must have caught on to this. She shot an apologetic glance Keiki's way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Damn you, Yuika-chan…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha~" Yuika merely made a joyful smile as she watched her helpless senior.</p>
<p class="null-p">As always, tormenting someone else brought her nothing but joy. When he saw this reaction, Keiki was unsure if she should feel glad that she was back to high spirits or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seriously, what do I do about this?</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation seemed helpless. If he were to keep silent about that question, he'd be tortured until he eventually spit it out, but his pride as a man made him want to avoid doing so.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want them to find out. I want to confess when it's just the two of us. In</p>
<p class="null-p">a romantic situation!</p>
<p class="null-p">That meant that telling them his feelings here was no good. He needed some way to escape from this predicament.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what can I do?</p>
<p class="null-p">Running away while restrained like this was obviously impossible. Giving in would create a battlefield, and keeping quiet would mean torture.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's all over, huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">He was forced to accept his fate. "-Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when Keiki had resigned himself to being sullied by these perverts, the current student council president Fujimoto Ayano walked into the room. She looked at the girls, and then at the boy restrained in the chair in the center of them, tilting her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Some kind of torture roleplay?" "Pretty much." Keiki sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I could charge up as much as I want right now, but maybe I should save you instead?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do! …Wait, Fujimoto-san, what do you mean by 'charge up'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's great that you all get along, but tying him up like this is taking things too far, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, it is. However, the calligraphy club girls weren't so kind as to let common sense rule their lives. Of course, they didn't back down at all, and the main criminals Mao and Yuika moved in to block Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about this, but this is a problem between Kiryuu and us." "That's right! Outsiders should stay out of this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't let me through, I'll use my authority as the student council president to decrease the club's budget."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're very sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The battle was over in mere seconds. Since the club owed a great debt to the student council because of previous circumstances, they couldn't afford to rebel against Ayano. Thanks to this, and everyone's help, Keiki was freed shortly thereafter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks a lot, Fujimoto-san. You really saved my bacon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to thank me. I came here because I had some business." "What kind of business?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's about the club president. I didn't get any notification of change, so I came to check. The other clubs have already sent theirs in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I completely forgot." "Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it couldn't be helped if she forgot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If possible, I'd like you to decide on a new club president soon." "A new club president, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think Keiki-kun would be fine." Sayuki said. "Huh? Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Sayuki, the other club members joined in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika also thinks that Keiki-senpai would be the best choice." "I'm not cut out to be the club president, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel the same as Mao-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, if you all say so, then I guess I can do it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't like he had any reason to decline. He had been part of the club the second longest, after Sayuki, so it would make sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then could I ask you to come with me to the student council office for some paperwork?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait… F-Fujimoto-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had barely finished speaking when she suddenly clung to Keiki's arm. "!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the student council president did this, the other girls immediately started emitting killing intent. Or, in more simpler terms, they all started glaring at Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, let's go~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, wait a moment! This is a bit too embarrassing, don't you think?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Ayano didn't bother to listen. She just walked away, dragging Keiki outside the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other members of the student council seemed to be out, so it was just the two of them. Keiki waited on the sofa for a moment, and Ayano joined him with a paper and pen in hand. She sat next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please write your class and name on here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gotcha."</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't anything complicated. He followed Ayano's simple instructions, and the paperwork was quickly finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Great work. I'll take care of the rest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about Sayuki-senpai. I think it just slipped her mind." "No problem. If anything, that was just a convenient excuse." "Hmm? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not even answering the question, Ayano just pressed her body against Keiki's, talking about something completely unrelated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Kiryuu-kun. It's just the two of us right now." "Sure seems like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They won't be coming back for some time." "R-Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So nobody will bother us now." Ayano said, gently resting her hand on Keiki's arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki could even react to this sudden development, he was gently pushed over, and he fell down on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, Fujimoto-san!? What are you-?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, Kiryuu-kun…" She gently whispered into Keiki's ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting on top of him, she continued speaking, like she was pleading with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say anything. Just listen to me, okay?" "Listen to you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't hold back any longer… My desire for you keeps growing day by day, Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun…" Her eyes were damp, like they were filled with expectation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks were red, like heat filled them. The girl, who looked like she was in heat, grabbed Keiki's necktie, and he found himself embraced in an intense hug.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaa!?" He let out a shriek like a maiden.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this rate, the chastity he had held dear for so long would be stolen from him. Right when he finally gave up on this chastity, Ayano drew even closer to Keiki, burying her face in his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniff sniff sniff… Haaah… Kiryuu-kun's scent is the best!" "…Well, I figured this would happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki yet again didn't get to taste a sweet and romantic first experience. Instead, his body was sniffed by the smell fetishist. It appears as if she had been targeting Keiki's bodily scent from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaah… I'm so happy. Now I can focus on my work again." "I'm glad to hear it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like a fish stranded on a beach, but Ayano sighed in satisfaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you've finished recharging, I'd appreciate it if you could get away from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So bluntly!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decided that today I would get spoiled lots by Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sound like a cat that's doing whatever suits its whimsy, you know." "Can you rub my head?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No coherence whatsoever, I see. I don't think that would be a good idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you do it, then I'll let you stay here. Or would you rather go back to the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will rub your head with all of my heart!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't possess enough courage to return. After all, if he did, he'd probably just be tied up again, so he decided to stay here with Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Ayano, how do you enjoy my head rubbing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's great. Continue to praise Ayano-san for her hard work as the student council president."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had received her permission, Keiki rubbed Ayano's head some more.</p>
<p class="null-p">I know I'm the one doing this, but isn't this situation pretty bad?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was but a normal boy. There was no way his heart wouldn't race from being this close to a cute girl like Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto-san smells really nice as well. Her hair is so silky, and her happy snickering voice is way too cute. How do I put this…?</p>
<p class="null-p">An odd sensation started to fill Keiki's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I have you here, I need to store as much of your scent as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sniff sniff sniff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the first time I've heard the term 'store your scent."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, being sniffed like this was nothing out of the ordinary for Keiki, and he didn't even get his hopes up that something else would happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I really like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is my scent really that great?" "That's great too, but…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's hand stopped rubbing Ayano's head, and he directed his gaze downwards. His eyes met Ayano's, but she shook her head. "No, it's nothing. Kiryuu-kun, can I ask you something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just now, in the clubroom, they talked about you having someone you like…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, she had heard their voices from the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That surprised me. I thought you were going for a harem ending, Kiryuu- kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do people really think I'm that much of a bastard?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, we do have reasons for that. You get along with everyone really well after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did me being tied up look like that…?" She should probably get her eyes checked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I ask one more thing?" "W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is the girl you like from the calligraphy club?" "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, he hesitated, wondering if he shouldn tell her. She probably wouldn't go around telling others. He put his index finger on his lips, emphasizing secrecy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keep it a secret, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see." After a bit of a lag, Ayano gave a faint mutter. Then, her smile suddenly had a more saddened feel to it. "So, about this person you like, Kiryuu-kun-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Still clinging to Keiki like before, the moment she opened her mouth to say something…</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Keiki-kun!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">…The door to the student council room swung wide open, and Sayuki barged inside. Of course, the other club members were right behind her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was wondering why it was taking you so long! So this is what you were doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We found Nii-san cheating again…" "Kiryuu, you really are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, you're the worst…" "This isn't what you think it is, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki pleaded innocence, but the fact that Ayano was still hugging him didn't exactly work in his favor. It's like an evil politician saying 'I have no memories' to dodge an accusation. There's no credibility in that whatsoever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, Fujimoto-san…" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you please help me clear up this misunderstanding?" "Hmph, I don't care about Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you saved me just now!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what happened in these few minutes that would cause her to change her mind?</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, how long is she going to cling to me like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Keiki currently wasn't going out with anyone, and thus this was not cheating, these excuses didn't work at all, and he was pressured by a full portion of rage from the perverted girls around him.</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, Keiki sat in his room, on a phone call with Shouma. 'Ahaha, that sounds like a catastrophe.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can say that again. Thanks to Yuika-chan, I went through hell today."</p>
<p class="null-p">He leaned back in his chair, reporting the events of the day to Shouma. The reason Keiki had called him like this was simply because too many things had happened, and he needed someone to listen.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Well, that just shows how much Koga-san loves you, I guess. It makes her want to tease the boy she likes'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if that's really what it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">'I really liked Koharu-chan's troubled expression when I teased her.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I get that. I bet she must be really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">Setting Shouma's current relationship status aside, Yuika's bombshell of an announcement created a hellstorm of problems for Keiki. He somehow made it home alive from the battlefield, but there was no way the others would be satisfied after all that. As a side note, when Keiki sent her a message asking 'Why would you say something like that?, the message that came back was:</p>
<p class="null-p">'Since you rejected Yuika, she wanted to cause you a bit of trouble~'</p>
<p class="null-p">That sentence was both cute and yet terrifying at the same time. But it barely showed any ill intent on Yuika's part.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, there's nothing gained from complaining about what has already happened. I'll just forget about what Yuika said and think about the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ohh, how straightforward of you.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Either way, if I want to end everything, I'll need to tell them eventually." 'Hmm…'</p>
<p class="null-p">From across the call, Keiki could hear Shouma letting out a sigh like he had figured something out.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I see. So you've decided as well, Keiki.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I can't keep things as they are forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">'Even though you always complained about them being perverts just a while ago.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"That opinion hasn't changed. When I became aware of my feelings, weird hobbies or interests like that aren't that big of a problem after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's the same with Shouma and Koharu. Shouma had accepted the fact that Koharu could be a bit of a stalker, and Koharu had accepted the fact that Shouma was a lolicon. Yet they got along so well. Being in love means accepting both the good and bad parts of a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I hope everything works out.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, Keiki wanted to avoid getting together with a pervert, but now he had found someone he wanted to be with no matter what. Through better or worse, he wanted to hold onto this love. In order to get there, there was one thing he had left to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll confess eventually-And I'll be the one to do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki ended his call with Shouma, he headed over to the bathroom to prepare for a bath. He rested his exhausted body in the hot water for a while, and after changing into some clean clothes, he quickly brushed his teeth and stepped outside again. Now he only had to get some good rest, and then he would be ready. Forget the problems of today, and focus on tomorrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Filling himself with determination, he went up to the second floor, and when he opened his bedroom door, he spotted his little sister sitting on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…" A pillow was in her arms, and she was looking at Keiki with a serious expression on her face. "This might be a bit sudden, but your bed has been occupied."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That really is sudden…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have the right to use your bed, of course. However, as I am a generous person, I will offer you half."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to sleep next to Nii-san today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I figured as much, seeing as you're ready to go with pillow in hand." "…I can't?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We might be brother and sister, but sleeping in the same bed at our age is a bit odd."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haven't we slept together a lot of times so far?" "Well, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't exactly argue against that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, fine. But don't attack me in my sleep, or I'll throw you out." "Yay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having received permission, the infiltrator dived under the covers. "You'll stir up dust if you jump around like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaaaay… Nii-san, are you going to sleep for the day?" "I was thinking about doing that, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then come here, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to tell me. This is my bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki turned off the lights and laid down next to his little sister. "Fufu, Nii-san is so warm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. I just got out of the bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">His entire body felt like it was steaming. As the two lay next to each other, Mizuha moved her arm, clinging to Keiki beneath the blanket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm making sure that Nii-san doesn't go anywhere." "I'm not going to get stranded again, so don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since Keiki and Sayuki got lost during their trip in the mountains,</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha would try to stay with Keiki as much as possible. Even when he was just watching TV in the living room, she would silently lean against his shoulder, and she oftentimes would read manga on top of his bed as well. Of course, that happened before the ski trip, too, but it seemed to be drastically more common now.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were even times when he found her on standby next to the bathroom, making sure that Keiki safely came out of the bath. At first, these actions seemed to be a result of this incident as well, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About what Yuika-chan said today…" "Again with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He should have seen that one coming. Mizuha had never brought it up once after they got back, but there was no way she hadn't been bothered by it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you have someone you like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will leave that to your imagination."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll just assume you have one." She continued. "Are you going to even keep it a secret from me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll tell you eventually." "I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was willing to tell her, but there were some things he needed to do first. Things were progressing a bit faster because of what Yuika had done, but Keiki needed to take care of one thing, and also mentally prepare himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I won't ask you anymore. Instead… let me just say one thing." "What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the only one who's allowed to show her panties to Nii-san, okay?" "What kind of confession is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're only allowed to get excited because of my panties." "What kind of request is that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no deeper meaning to it. It's just a declaration of my resolve." "Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was even more lost. However, the girl herself seemed satisfied, and she flashed him a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's all I wanted to say. Goodnight, Nii-san." "Y-Yeah… Night…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh…" That sneak attack took Keiki by surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha let go of Keiki and turned her back towards him, but she showed no signs of leaving the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Goodnight, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">He told his jealous and cute little sister a goodnight one last time, and then closed his eyes as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, after classes had ended, Keiki stood in front of the clubroom, smartphone in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No response from Sayuki-senpai, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He sent her a message early in the morning, but nothing came back from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every call he made was unanswered. Did her phone run out of battery, or did she forget it altogether? Since she could be a bit clumsy at times, that was definitely possible, but it was rare to not be able to reach her like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though I had something important to talk about…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki came to school determined to respond to her confession. Yet now she was nowhere to be found. Just staying at the clubroom wouldn't do him any good, so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll go look for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like he had any particular time limit, but after what Yuika said the day prior, he wanted to take care of it that day. He put his bag down inside the clubroom and started walking around the school. Since this was a fairly large school, he first made his way from the clubroom building to classroom building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, I feel like this has happened before."</p>
<p class="null-p">Back when Keiki assumed that Sayuki was Cinderella, but she was under the impression that he had figured out her fetish, she started avoiding him for quite some time. In the end, Sayuki wasn't Cinderella, just a pervert with a peculiar fetish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he made his way around school, many things caught his attention. The shoe box where he always greeted Sayuki, the hallway he first did a wall- slam on her, the classroom where she made omurice for him during the culture festival, the hallway where she showed him her panties. All these nostalgic memories came rushing back to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This second year went by in a flash, for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">His first year at this school couldn't have been calmer. He started showing up at the calligraphy club, worked as a library committee member, studied for his exams, and spent a normal and average school life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the second year rolled around, he found himself busy with the whole Cinderella incident, then he started uncovering more and more perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika and Mao joined the calligraphy club, and even Mizuha. Thanks to that, the calligraphy club grew more noisy, and Sayuki started smiling more. To Keiki, that was something wonderful. In the midst of these changes, he only realized at the very end how his eyes were always following her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Not here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki couldn't be found at the third-year classrooms either. Since her outdoor shoes were still in the shoe locker, she should still be somewhere in school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Isn't that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was wondering if he should return to the clubroom, he spotted a girl holding a camera down the hallway. It was a small girl with braided hair and a hood over her head. Just like Sayuki, her blue skirt showed that she was a third-year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, Koharu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kiryuu-kun. Hey there."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki called out to her, Koharu returned an angelic smile. "Did you finish your photoshoot with Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I was on my way back to look at them in the astronomy clubroom. Would you like to join me, Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll pass. I'm actually looking for Sayuki-senpai." "She isn't in the clubroom?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, and I can't get in touch with her, either." "Sorry, I haven't seen her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but-" Koharu spoke up like she had remembered something. "I might have an idea as to where she could have gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Koharu's advice, Keiki headed to the library room, and he soon spotted the girl at a table beside the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was studying, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he approached the table, he spotted several math workbooks in front of her. She was completely focused on her work, not even noticing her junior.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, Tokihara Sayuki was quite a hard worker. She acted like she barely studied, but her grades were only as high as they were because she worked so hard. She didn't brag about it, she just felt embarrassed to show her efforts in front of the others. But at the same time she never hesitated to show her underwear. That's probably why she was studying here in the library, and not in the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She isn't even noticing that I'm here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that Keiki had some urgent business to talk to her about, but bothering her during her studies was something he wanted to avoid. He sat down in the seat next to her. Looking at the math formulae wasn't fun at all, so his gaze naturally drifted towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She sure is beautiful…</p>
<p class="null-p">Her gaze was as determined as it was when she worked on her calligraphy. "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The serious expression on her face was like how she looked in the clubroom. He would sit in the room, filled with the scent of tatami mats and ink, until she noticed his presence. He could watch her forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew…" Sayuki stopped writing. She probably had made it to a good stopping point.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, she stretched both of her arms, letting out a rather stimulating groan. Naturally, that caused her two mountains to shake violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took a mental picture, and the girl directed her gaze sideways, noticing her junior sitting next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work, Sayuki-senpai." "How long have you been there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got here around ten minutes ago." "You should have called out to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I didn't want to bother you during your studies." "I can always make time for you, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then could I have some right now?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's something very important." "Something very important, you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have guessed what he meant. She audibly gulped, then nodded. "I understand…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They both made their way to the courtyard. It was a small space surrounded by school buildings around. That being said, since it was still fairly early in February, nobody was around. Keiki had considered bringing a jacket with him, but since he wanted to get things over quickly, he decided it shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, this was the place the two had first met. When Keiki had just started attending this school, he spotted her here as he walked down the path to go home. Sometimes he thought about what would have happened if he didn't call out to her here. If he hadn't seen the crying upperclassman, if he hadn't called out to her, if he didn't join the calligraphy club… Surely, these joyful and exciting, though sometimes a bit exhausting, days with the other club members would never have happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that sense, Keiki's high school life began here. That's why he had to respond to Sayuki's confession in this very spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry it took me so long to come up with my answer." "I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two stood in front of the bench where they first met, facing each other. "Can I hear the reply to my confession?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took a deep breath and said what was at the forefront of his mind. "I think that you're a very charming person1, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've always admired you as a senior. You're beautiful and kind, and although you might be not that great at cleaning or sports, that part of you is cute as well-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki always thought that she was a kind person. She acted considerate even towards Yuika, who she always fought with. There was even the fact how she secretly worked hard, and more than anything, how she possessed beauty that wasn't rivalled by many.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really happy to hear you felt that way, Sayuki-senpai." "Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">During the first shrine visit that day, he heard the girl's feelings. A lot of things happened after that, and even after some time had passed after Sayuki voiced her wish for the two of them to go out, his heart continued to race.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been conscious of you ever since, and when we got stranded during that mountain trip, my heart beated painfully fast when I had you next to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back on it, that was quite the dangerous situation, in a lot of ways. "Your face was as red as a tomato back then, Keiki-kun. It was so cute." "The same goes for you, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">They jested a bit, and then returned to the topic at hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, I was really happy that I could help you. It made me realize that you saw me as a man as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he realized that, the girl looked even more lovable than before. The sight of her leaning against his shoulder was unbearably cute. Being relied on by a beautiful upperclassman would make any boy happy. It was pretty embarrassing to admit, but that was one of the most important things that led Keiki to realize his feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never once thought you were a girl, Keiki-kun." "Well, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do think you have some feminine sides to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just for reference, what might you be talking about?" "Do you really want to hear it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I think I'm good." It would probably hurt his pride as a man if he did.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From what I've heard, you were acting quite clingy with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not wrong. Though sometimes I just wanted to run away because you were too much of a pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was your moment where you were supposed to say 'A perverted Senpai is still wonderful and cute', okay?" Sayuki smiled while sulking.</p>
<p class="null-p">That gesture was so cute that it made Keiki want to tease her some more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being with her is really fun…</p>
<p class="null-p">He never once felt bored when he was with her. Going out with her would surely be fun every day. They could talk with each other, love each other, fight over the stupidest things, but make up right away. Keep loving each other all the time. Hold hands, walk towards a happy future. This was the first time he had such feelings towards a member of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've only realized it now, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It took him quite some time to realize, but… "I've always liked you, Sayuki-senpai."</p>

<p class="null-p">1 Original word here is Woman</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: How to save the Heroine from her Slump</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu and the club president have been acting strange recently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was sitting on her usual chair in the clubroom, facing her manuscript. She snuck glances at the two of them with these thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai!? What are you doing!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you acting so embarrassed? We're so close that a bit of skinship shouldn't be that big of a deal. But you're really cute when you're embarrassed, Keiki-kun. I'll do it some more as a reward~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mugh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To briefly explain the situation, Keiki was currently sitting on the tatami mat, being embraced by Sayuki. Not to mention that it was a lovey-dovey hug, filled with lots of emotion. Thanks to that, Sayuki's large breasts were pressed against Keiki, suffocating him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aren't you bragging a bit too much?</p>
<p class="null-p">If he loved big breasts that much, he might as well marry them. Mao clicked her tongue and yet again thought to herself that they'd been acting odd as of late. Of course, Sayuki always showed excessive skinship towards Keiki, but now they looked even closer than before. It had reached a level where Mao found herself thinking Did these two start dating or something?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I'm right here, they're really going all-out with their flirting…</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, watching the boy she liked be all lovey-dovey with another girl</p>
<p class="null-p">made it especially tough for her. But she also couldn't just say 'Don't act so close with another girl', as that would reveal the fact that she had kept two years' worth of one-sided feelings for him secret…</p>
<p class="null-p">If Yuika was here, she'd definitely get between them…</p>
<p class="null-p">Sadly, said little devil was nowhere to be found. Neither was Mizuha, which meant that Mao was the only person who could do something about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhhhhh, I really hate this…!!!</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Mao loved Kiryuu Keiki, she found herself almost going crazy when she saw him acting playful with that big-breasted upperclassman. Her inner thoughts were screaming Just explode already, which wasn't exactly something a maiden like her should be thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai! You're suffocating me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you lucky that you get to do breath exercises and you're not even underwater~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's head was yet again swallowed in the great valley between Sayuki's chest, which caused Mao's pen to screech along the desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just drown in there for all I care!</p>
<p class="null-p">He should just explode between those giant bombs. That would be a happy way to go for a bastard like Keiki. Mao pretended she was drawing on her manuscript, but in reality, her head was filled with curses.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki finally freed Keiki. "Fufu, next I'll give you a lap pillow and rub your head, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just do whatever you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why is Kiryuu acting so obedient?</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, he'd try to resist some more. She knew that face he was making. He made that exact face whenever he resigned himself to something. That was obviously the case, since he rested his head on Sayuki's lap. She reached for his head, only to grab a brush next to her. She drew something on her junior's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai!? Did you write something on my face!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I only wrote something that I can't say with my mouth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you do that!?" Keiki lashed out at Sayuki, while still resting on her lap.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki ignored his reaction and gently rubbed his head like she had promised.</p>
<p class="null-p">These two really are close…</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like they were in perfect sync, like there wasn't any room for anyone else to get between them. Although Keiki couldn't see it, Mao had already read what Sayuki had written.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Love you'…Seriously? You're that much of an idiotic couple…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Mao couldn't say that either. The atmosphere between these two had completely crossed the limits of a healthy Senior-Junior relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way a boy and a girl who weren't even going out with each other would act like this. Tokihara Sayuki wasn't even trying to hide her affection. At the same time, Kiryuu Keiki accepted it, and seemed fairly satisfied with it. An emotion somewhat akin to panic filled Mao's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this actually…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mind started begging the question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe these two are actually going out after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after Mao had arrived at her home, that thought wouldn't leave her mind. Those two were always close, but never had they been this lovey-</p>
<p class="null-p">dovey. Even from Mao's point of view, the two of them looked like lovers. They might even start going at it like rabbits when nobody is around-</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she started pursuing that avenue of thought, Mao's head went crazy, and she slammed it against her desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">'-Wah, Minami-sensei!? It sounded like you hit your face on a hard, probably wooden surface! Are you okay!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm fine. Don't worry about me."</p>
<p class="null-p">That wasn't good. All that thinking pulled her attention away from the phone call. Her phone was on speaker mode, and she had put it on the desk. She was currently in her own room, on the phone with her, Nanami Mao's, editor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today they were planning on talking about some details concerning a new job, but since Mao lived quite a ways away from the publisher's office, they always kept contact via phone or email. Mao had met her editor in person a few times, and from the looks of it, she seemed to be a lady in her late twenties.</p>
<p class="null-p">'M-Minami-sensei? You seem to be a bit absent-minded today. Did you perhaps have a fight with your boyfriend?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have a boyfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, Nanjou Mao did not have a boyfriend. However, she had a boy she was interested in. The reason Mao was in a bad mood was simply because that boy was getting along a bit too well with another girl, but that wasn't anything worth mentioning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, please continue." 'Ah, yes. Then…'</p>
<p class="null-p">She must be busy looking through documents right now. After a short silence, the woman spoke up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">'For now, I have read the manuscript. It seems okay, so I will send you minor corrections for wording and such via email.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">'So, about the deadline… We'd like to ask for it to be done on the 10th of February at the latest.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"The 10th, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked over at the calendar. Today was the 2nd of February, a Friday. In other words, she had roughly a week.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Although it is just a one-shot, we should have given you more time to prepare. I'm terribly sorry. We don't have any assistants left that could help you… Will you be able to do it?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It doesn't have as many pages as last time, and I can draw pretty fast. Not to mention that nobody can be blamed for the other mangaka suddenly ending up in the hospital."</p>
<p class="null-p">'That's great to hear. I was really worried what we would do now. We also ran out of other one-shots to use… But that isn't important right now. If this one-shot goes well, we might even serialize it! I know the schedule is tough, but please try your best!'</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was only given this job because a spot opened up in a magazine, and they offered Mao this opportunity. Since she had gotten the OK for the overall design, she could now work on the manuscript. She would keep the character designs similar to before and just focus on drawing the rest around it. If she took a pass on a few hours of sleep, it should definitely be doable.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Then I wish you the best of luck.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood." Mao hung up and let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she wasn't too good at dealing with others, a call like that was pretty exhausting, especially since it was a pretty important one. Even so, she was elated at the results. The one-shot 'Would you be able to love a pervert as long as he's hot?' she had published in the magazine last time had received good reviews overall, and now she had even gotten another chance to publish a one-shot. Normally, this was a very important call for Mao's overall future, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"What am I thinking, spacing out like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, her mind drifted towards the boy, even if she didn't want to admit it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried to act tough during the training camp, but I'm still super inexperienced…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that she'd focus on her own hobbies and future, rather than some boy she was interested in, but this was the result. She couldn't help but worry about what Keiki was doing right now, and she was unable to even focus on her work. Just how much did she like that boy, anyway?</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not my problem what he's doing and who he's getting along with. I'll just focus on my work…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If she were to get a serialization now, she'd only be more busy, and she wouldn't have any time to think about love. Mao's tsundere attribute reared its ugly head again, and she turned back to her beloved desk, pouring more attention into her work.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_9.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The following Monday, late into the day after classes had ended, a visitor arrived at Mao's private working room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry to call you over like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm happy that I can help you, Mao-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for being my model, Mizuha. I'll treat you to some crepes another time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">While exchanging a few words, Mao started drawing as she closely inspected Mizuha sitting on the bed. Mao held her drawing tablet on her lap, totally immersed in her work. Since they both came here right after school, they were wearing their uniforms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But all the characters you've drawn so far are boys, right? Will I really be a good model?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's totally fine~ This is a character modeled after you, anyway." "You turned me into a boy without telling me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your name is 'Mizuki,' by the way." "Isn't that basically my actual name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'm using all of the calligraphy club members as models. I mean, Kiryuu is the heroine this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. I'm looking forward to that." "Ah, that expression just now was great." "Huh!? So embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly speaking, Mizuha's smile was cute enough to make even Mao jealous. She always looked like a maiden in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're amazing, Mao-chan. Being a professional mangaka and all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that amazing. Not to mention that I can't be a pro as long as I'm underage… Without Kiryuu, I would have stopped mid-way."</p>
<p class="null-p">When her first one-shot received harsh critique, Mao found herself in a slump. Keiki was the one to cheer her up and teach her the importance of not giving up.</p>
<p class="null-p">If not for him, I probably wouldn't be where I am right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">If her heart had stayed broken, then she wouldn't have worked on a new work, and she definitely wouldn't have received this job she had now. Eternal gratitude was not far from what Mao felt like expressing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Say, Mizuha?" "Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you think Kiryuu has feelings for the club president?" "Where did that come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, aren't they getting along really well as of late?" "Well, Nii-san getting along with another girl is nothing new." "Aren't you bothered by that? You like Kiryuu too, right?" "'Too'? You mean there's others?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should be well aware of it, right? The club president, Yuika… even Ayano and Airi are highly suspicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she left herself out of the equation. Then again, since Mizuha was pretty sharp, she probably had figured that out already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it, Nii-san is pretty popular." "And yet he himself isn't aware of it at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he's like a picture-perfect harem protagonist with all the girls around him having feelings for him, he himself has no idea, which makes it all the more infuriating. Though that dense head of his is exactly what made him that much of a harem protagonist… Discussing that, however, was off- topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? Aren't you bothered by the fact that your beloved Oni-chan and Tokihara-senpai are getting along so well as of late?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I am bothered by it. I don't want the person I like to be flirting with someone else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well… That makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was overwhelmed by Mizuha's serious tone of voice. Honestly speaking, she seemed pretty annoyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that Tokihara-senpai is right up Nii-san's alley." "Yeah, he seems to be into older girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that she has big breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you're not losing much in that area, Mizuha." Mao's gaze wandered towards Mizuha's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was rocking quite the bod, herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Nii-san likes big breasts, but he wouldn't choose a girl just because of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that Nii-san has been acting oddly as of late. I feel like he's hiding some things, not just about Tokihara-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiding what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know, but something's off." "Hmmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao didn't know what that could be, but if Mizuha, his little sister, felt that way, then there must be something to it. Since this had only happened recently, Keiki's odd behaviour might be related to Sayuki's sudden assertiveness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you going to ask Kiryuu about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nii-san doesn't want to tell me, then I don't won't force him. I like him, and even if he has feelings for Senpai, that wouldn't change anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You sure are amazing, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">She could be honest about her feelings. It seemed simple enough, but it was really more difficult than anything, and it required a lot of courage.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't have that sort of courage…</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had thrown away all the chances she had to confess so far. Whenever the perfect opportunity came around, she didn't have the courage to take the final step.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then again, I don't plan to give up on Nii-san, so if there's a chance, I'm ready to cross the line."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're more aggressive than I thought, Mizuha…" "Really? I mean, I want to be together with the boy I like." "That… is true, I guess…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was an adolescent girl as well, so it'd be a lie to say she never had any fantasies like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Nii-san even sank his poisonous fangs into Mao-chan. What a sinful man he is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah, no!? I never said that the person is Kiryuu!" "Yeah yeah, tsundere maiden."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now even Mizuha was treating her like a tsundere. "Hey, Mao-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know who Nii-san has feelings for, but if either of us end up going out with Nii-san, then no bad feelings, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's impossible." Her mouth moved before her head could think. "If Kiryuu were to choose you, Mizuha, then I'd definitely curse both of you and be jealous about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Mizuha's eyes opened wide in shock, only for her to show a big smile afterwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're finally being honest." "Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">How embarrassing. Mizuha toyed with her and got her to reveal her honest feelings. Whenever she's with Mizuha, Mao's armor gets weaker and weaker. These siblings really knew how to hit where it hurts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, we're not done yet, so hold still, Mizuha." "Okaaay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao wasn't quite done yet using Mizuha as her model. She swallowed her embarrassment and continued drawing on her tablet.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Every day after that, Mao was busy with her work. She had to finish the manuscript in a week, so wasting time was not an option. She found herself constantly trying to balance life as a high school student and life as a newcomer mangaka. She'd work until early in the morning and get a few hours of sleep until school. After coming back from school, it was time to work on her manuscript again. This cycle continued over and over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mm, it's already this late?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she realized it, it was already midnight. She put her pen away, trying to get some short rest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I really like this heroine here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was currently working on the climax of the one-shot. The scene showed the sadistic hero 'Ritsuka' showing off his trunks to the protagonist 'Keiko', and embarrassing her. Even though the model for the heroine was a boring and average boy, the girl herself turned out great. She would blush furiously just from seeing a boy's underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe Kiryuu likes honest girls more, after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He probably preferred someone easy to get along with like Yuika or Mizuha. If so, then Mao was at a severe disadvantage. After all, Mao was a helpless tsundere. She was plagued by her feelings, and yet she couldn't even speak them out loud. She was the exact opposite of Yuika and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think, Sergeant?" She asked, holding up the plush toy sitting on top of her shelf.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Sergeant' here referred to Sergeant Penguin. It was a fat penguin with a bad glare in his eyes, holding a fish as his weapon. When Mao and Keiki went on a date to collect data, he won this guy for her at a claw game.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're not giving me an answer, then I sentence you to death by hugging!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she dove right into her bed. "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">If she closed her eyes now, she'd definitely fall asleep, so she decided to stare up at the ceiling. Her stomach started growling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Despite the fact that my personality sucks, my stomach sure is honest…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao vaguely remembered not eating dinner. It made sense that she'd be hungry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'll just make some cup ramen."</p>
<p class="null-p">The night is long for a mangaka. She needed some more nutrition to survive the night battle. Looking forward to a delicious cup of ramen, Mao stood up from her bed. She put the Sergeant back in his original position, then her smartphone vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who could it be at this hour-Wait, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sender of the email turned out to be the boy she was worrying about. "What'd he say… 'I'm in front of your house right now'… What?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The content of the email left Mao shocked beyond belief. "Why would he…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't know why, but if that was true, then making him wait was not an option. She put on a light cardigan and stepped outside. Taking the elevator, she went down from the fourth to the first floor, and when she left the flat, she found the boy wearing a coat. Keiki spotted Mao and raised his hand, which was covered by a warm glove.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo. Sorry to bother you when you're so busy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind, but… Why are you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha made you a late-night snack; Rice and some miso soup. She figured that you'd get hungry around now, so she wanted you to eat that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha did?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. She said you're probably just living on cup ramen again." "Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao couldn't argue against that, as she was just about to make some. "I couldn't let Mizuha walk outside this late, so that's why I'm here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… Thanks, that's great timing." She thanked him and accepted the warm plastic bag. "She's got good sense. I was gonna eat some cup ramen just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She'd scold you if she heard that." "Probably, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao never could find the motivation to cook this close to a deadline, which was why she mostly lived off convenience store food, absolutely ruining the balance of her diet. Mizuha probably knew this and made her a meal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, the tip of your nose is pretty red. Aren't you cold?" "Yeah, I've been outside for a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want you catching a cold, so how about you come in for a bit?" "Nah, it's pretty late, so I'll pass."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mama isn't home since she works at night, though." "Um… That would make it even worse, right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Ah, wait!" She realized her slip-up too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inviting a boy into her home at such a late time, with nobody else home, would be easily misunderstood, and she couldn't argue otherwise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I didn't mean it that way! I just wanted you to warm up with some tea, that's all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I know." "Good, then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he came all the way for her, the mood was ruined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I don't want to bother you any longer, so I'll be on my way now." "Ah, wait a second!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She called out to stop him, but found herself without anything else to talk about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, it's nothing." "'Zat so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Thanks for the emergency rations."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No prob. See you at school."</p>
<p class="null-p">Giving a final farewell, Keiki left for good. Mao watched him walk off into the distance and let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What am I doing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way she could tell him that she just wanted to talk some more.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Days passed, and there was one day left before the deadline. Specifically, it was a Friday during lunch break. Mao sought out something to drink after she had finished some yakisoba bread, and headed to the vending machine near the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now I only need to finish the scenery, so I should be able to make it in time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her progress was at about 80%. Although she couldn't exactly take her time, finishing the manuscript should be doable given her current pace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Isn't that…" When Mao made it to the shoe lockers, she stopped in her tracks. "Kiryuu and the club president?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Sayuki both stood in front of the vending machine she wanted to visit. Confirming this, Mao subconsciously hid herself in the shadows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are they doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She peeked her head around the corner and observed the two of them. She could only make out small snippets of conversation, but she could guess the basic situation. Apparently, Sayuki was eager to take a sip from the juice Keiki had bought from the vending machine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again. They're going around flirting again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There honestly had to be a limit to this. Mao was already exhausted from her endless days of working, so normies enjoying their youths was nothing less than poison for her eyes. More than anything, she felt incredibly jealous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, Keiki seemed to resign himself, and offered Sayuki a sip. Naturally, she didn't miss the opportunity, and she gleefully put the straw in her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, an indirect kiss…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, something like this didn't mean anything special. Sharing drinks between friends was normal, so making assumptions about their relationship</p>
<p class="null-p">from this would be going too far. She knew that in her head, but… "…Why am I even hiding…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao stood frozen in the shadows until the two of them walked away.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_10.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu, you… idioooooooooooooooooot!!!</p>
<p class="null-p">Sixth period came around, and Mao vented all her frustration into the volleyball she spiked down onto the other side of the court. The other team was unable to catch that ball filled with curses and resentment, which scored Mao's team another point. She felt a bit refreshed. Megumi came to talk to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice shot, Nanjou-chan! You're on top form today too, huh?" "I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The other team couldn't even react. Do you have any tips you could give me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just imagine that the ball is Kiryuu's face, and smash it as hard as you can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh…" Megumi received an answer she didn't expect, and took a step back. "Anyway, um… Next it's my serve, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go get 'em."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi headed to the serve line, and the game resumed with her serve. It drew a beautiful arc mid-air, was received by a girl on the opposing team, and the volley started.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu, you idiot. Super idiot. Ultra idiot.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked at the ball floating mid-air and kept cursing inside her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">These two have to be going out, right…?</p>
<p class="null-p">All of the girls in the calligraphy club were targeting Keiki's chastity. Since a bloodbath would begin if he suddenly started dating someone, it wouldn't be weird to assume he was keeping his relationship with Sayuki a secret. Even though these were but mere assumptions, they wouldn't leave Mao's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-chan! Heads up!" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was brought back to reality when she heard Megumi's voice, and she turned to face forwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been so lost in her thoughts that she wasn't following the ball anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yikes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Dodging the ball would be impossible. On reflex, she covered her face with her hands. Right after-a dull sound rang out, and an impact followed. The ball was redirected by Mao's hand, and dropped to the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-chan!? Are you okay!?" "…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao didn't have the energy to answer Megumi. The pain running through the finger of the hand that had blocked the ball didn't allow her to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time she realized that she had injured her dominant hand, all blood drained from her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao received emergency treatment at the infirmary, and a thick bandage was placed around the injured finger to keep it from moving. Upon her return to the classroom, Keiki came running.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu? Why are you still here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was cooling her injury with an ice bag, and all the classes for the day had</p>
<p class="null-p">already come to an end, so nobody should still be in the classroom. Yet Keiki acted like him being there was the most obvious thing in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was worried about you, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really know how to meddle with other people's business, Kiryuu." "More importantly, how's your injury?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A jammed finger. It's not that big of a deal. It should be healed in like two to three days."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Teacher Tachibana did say 'It's not broken, but you should probably get it checked out at a hospital', but Mao didn't want to worry Keiki any more than necessary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank goodness it's not anything serious." "…It is serious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I do…? The deadline for the one-shot is tomorrow…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She just so happened to injure the index finger of her dominant hand. As a mangaka, this was a fatal injury. Not to mention that she had been told to let the finger rest for two to three days. In other words, she wouldn't be able to finish the manuscript until tomorrow. When she came to that realization, her mind turned blank.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, I'll draw it. Whatever it takes, I'll make it in time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't do that. You'll only make your injury worse if you try." "Then I'll draw with my left hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way you can do that, right? Even you can't do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao herself knew that better than anyone. "…Even so, I need to finish this."</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, she really couldn't give up. This work wasn't just her problem alone. She collected data with Keiki, had him help with the outline, and was promised another chance for a one-shot, maybe even a serialization. Ruining it all in such a pathetic way was just awful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright, I understand." "Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll help you." "Eh, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like I don't have anything to do with that manga, right?" "Kiryuu…" Mao felt the tears welling up in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki always helped her, even to the level of staying in the same hotel, waiting for her to finish working on the manuscript.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how much work is left?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I finished drawing the characters, so now it's only the scenery and background. If not for this injury, one more all-nighter would have done the trick…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it still would've been an all-nighter, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, Mao was quite a fast worker. Since she estimated another all- nighter was necessary, the amount of work left must be larger than Keiki anticipated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't you ask your editor for an assistant?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not possible. I'm drawing this on my own because everybody else is busy." "I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that I don't have any time to search for some. The deadline</p>
<p class="null-p">will come before I get them together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then keep the background as simple as possible when it's not necessary…" "That won't do…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The drawings, story, and the characters! If one is missing, then the manga fails. No matter how good your story is, if the drawings don't live up to it, it'll all be for nothing. A reader can tell at first glance. Worst-case scenario, the overall evaluation of it will drop, and my own reputation will…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to disappoint the readers. That is the one thing I want to avoid as a content creator."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like Mao had been a genius at drawing from the very start. She had complete confidence in the first works she released, only to not sell a single one. She even remembered the readers' disappointed faces. She never wanted to go through something like that again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, Mao was a professional mangaka. It was her duty to maintain a certain level of quality, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Kiryuu… Even though you offered to help, I'm being selfish…" "No, I'm just not experienced enough. Let's think of something else." "Yeah… Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, the best idea would be to get you some assistants."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But how do I find one today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was barely any time left. Even if she asked everyone from the calligraphy club for help, they weren't skilled enough. Keiki aside, neither Sayuki nor Mizuha had any talent at all, to put it bluntly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought about that as well, but her drawing style isn't well-suited for a manga…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed like the only person that could be of use, but her speciality was picture books, so that wouldn't work either.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should I do about this? I need help, but I need people at a certain level of skill as well…</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded impossible. An unclearable game. At the very least, Mao had no way of solving this problem. Of course, Keiki probably didn't know of anyone else, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Yuika-chan isn't good enough, then I guess… Wait a second." "Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might know of some assistants…" "Eh? Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Leave it to me. I'll get them together." "I mean, that would be great, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded impossible to Mao, but apparently Keiki knew someone convenient like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around an hour passed after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I may introduce you, these are the club members of the manga research</p>
<p class="null-p">club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The manga research club…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had gone home to prepare everything and then headed to the Kiryuu Household, where she was greeted by Keiki and three boys.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Third-year Inooka." "Second-year Shikagawa." "First-year Chouno."</p>
<p class="null-p">First was the third-year Inooka, who had a lean stature along with long bangs that covered both of his eyes. After that was the slim, glasses-wearing second-year Shikagawa. Finally, first-year Chouno introduced himself, who had a smaller stature, and was presumably the quiet type.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hello… I'm a second-year, Nanjou." Mao was slightly tense as she introduced herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, since they didn't have any time to change, both Mao and Keiki were still wearing their school uniforms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao spoke to Keiki in a quiet voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know this might be a bit late to ask, but can we really trust them?" "It's fine. I can guarantee you they're talented."</p>
<p class="null-p">According to Keiki, these three had created a wonderful short story with Megumi's help. Of course, when it came to drawing characters, Mao still was worlds above them, but they could draw professional-level backgrounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't know Kiryuu had these kinds of connections…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The one who brought them together was Onizuka-san, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">After his conversation with Mao, Keiki had apparently called Megumi. When he explained the circumstances, she was willing to help out, and he gathered the members of the manga research club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But are you really okay with us using this room?" "I got permission from Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eternal gratitude…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That very Mizuha was out right now, buying food supplies for this group of people. Since Mao's place would have been too small, this was perfect for her. Innoka and the others had already set up their materials, so they were just waiting for Mao to start.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I never expected that we would have a professional mangaka at our school." Inooka's gaze was filled with respect as he looked at Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's an honor to help the upcoming Minami-sensei." Shikagawa voiced his excitement after Inooka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-senpai, please give me your autograph!" Chouno's eyes were sparkling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Huh…" Mao was slightly confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was already bad at dealing with others, and this much appreciation was unfamiliar to her. But Keiki prodded her forwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, Nanjou, they're waiting for their orders." "Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was Mao's work, and they were helping out for free. Before they started their work, she should at least thank them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, then… Thanks for today. I hope we get along."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sir, yes Sir!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did they act the same way towards Megumi? They seemed to be motivated, at least.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-senpai, could you scan the current manuscript and send it to us? We mostly work digitally."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah, got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-shi, what should I do?" asked Shikagawa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… Please take care of the protagonist's living room here. I'll send you the material from last month's magazine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then should I do the classroom here?" "Yes, please do, Inooka-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao became the commander of the operation, divvying up the parts that needed to be drawn. Since this was her first time working with assistants, she was a bit bewildered at first, but after she got the hang of it, work moved along smoothly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensei! I've finished the scenery here, so please check it!" "Eh, already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Around two hours later, the first one to speak up was Inooka. "How does this look?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is…!?" She took a peek at his progress, and her eyes shot wide open. "It's perfect…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as she had muttered in bewilderment, the classroom scene he had drawn was perfect. It didn't deviate too much from the character's artstyle, and it fit</p>
<p class="null-p">perfectly. There was nothing Mao could have complained about. "This is way too good…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll continue with the next scene just like this, okay?" "Yes, please do."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mao gave the OK, Inooka turned towards his tablet again and resumed his work. Mao let out a relieved sigh, and Keiki came up to talk to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So is it gonna be doable?" "Somehow, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">She and Keiki looked at each other, smiling. After her injury, she had been really worried about what might happen, but she had finally seen the light in the darkness, which was why she could finally smile again.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, work progressed somewhat smoothly. "Ah!? We ran out of energy drinks!" "Understood, I'll buy some more!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu! I'll give you the money later, so get me the best one!" "Leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Keiki's job to supply Mao and the others with necessary supplements, supporting them from the shadows. Energy drinks were especially vital today. He might not be able to help with the drawings, but he was happy to do anything else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey!? Who put a flower pattern on Yukio's underwear!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensei, that was me! I'm sorry, I didn't have any reference, so based it off my own!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's sexual harassment, Senpai! You know that, right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was some trouble midway though, but they somehow made it past that. "I made you all a late-night snack."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much, Mizuha-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once night came around, Mizuha offered some food to the hard-working boys. Homemade food from a beautiful girl was the best possible energizer for the exhausted soldiers. Thanks to that, they became fans of both Mao and Mizuha at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks a lot, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'm looking forward to your manga as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short break with refreshments, they restarted on their work. Inooka, Shikagawa, and Chouno finished their respective tasks, and Mao checked them over. If need be, she threw in some small adjustments that needed fixing, or gave them samples that could help with their scenery. Even if you couldn't draw, there were still many things that needed work. Everyone fulfilled their own role, not resting a moment, and just focused on their work at hand. All in order to please the readers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it, my eyes are getting blurry…" "Inooka-shi, fight!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! We can't give up just yet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The club members all supported each other, and time passed late into the night. Around the time the sun slowly started to rise-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…And, send." Mao sent the email with the manuscript. "W-We're doneeeeee!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the three assistants and the Kiryuu siblings, Nanjou Mao made it through her greatest battle yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, everyone. You really saved me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, we've all been bored as of late since Megu-senpai was out, so it felt refreshing to go all out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Feel free to call us again if you need help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will come running whenever Mao-tan needs my assistance."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao gave her heartfelt thanks after escorting the three of them to the entrance, and after showing smiles of their own, Chouno and the others left. All of them were staggering a bit, but since they had no school today, they could catch up on some sleep now. After watching them disappear into the distance, Mao turned towards Keiki next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe they'd help me out again in the future if I asked them." "I feel like they'd be down for it." Keiki grinned as he responded. "…What's that face for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just thought that it's pretty rare of you to say that." "Well, they did save my butt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank goodness. I was worried that they wouldn't be able to help either." "Well, calling me 'Mao-tan' was taking it a bit too far, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, Mao was riddled with anxiety, but these three were easier to get along with than expected. They worked really hard, as well. As a side note, the Goddess Mizuha, who provided them with snacks, was back in her room getting some sleep now that the manuscript was out. After all, unlike Mao, Mizuha had a healthy lifestyle. She must be exhausted by pulling an all- nighter that she wasn't used to.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was probably asleep at this point, so only Keiki and Mao were seeing Chouno and the other two off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, thank you. I would have been lost without you." "I didn't do anything, really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. If not for you, I would have been left alone with no assistants who could help me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it got significantly better after she joined the calligraphy club, she was still bad at dealing with other people, so searching for help would have been impossible on her own. This time, she had been forced to learn the fear of not having anybody she could rely on, and she had also realized that there were things she couldn't do on her own. If not for Keiki's connections, she surely wouldn't have finished the manuscript in time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You always end up saving me, Kiryuu." "It's not that big of a deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I knew you'd say as much."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's just the type of person he was. He hadn't changed at all, ever since then. He was still the same Keiki who saved Mao from becoming a library committee member after she lost in the lottery. When she was deep in a slump, he gave her the necessary push.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it wasn't that Mao was special to him. If there was someone in need of help in front of him, he would rush to their aid without hesitation. Because that's how Kiryuu Keiki operated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You're an idiot, Kiryuu." "Huh, where did that come from!?" "It's fine. I'm praising you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sure didn't sound like praise…" A big question mark appeared above Keiki's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Mao couldn't tell him what she was thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seriously, what am I even doing…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that the manuscript was completed, she had let down her guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">My head's full of Kiryuu, all the damn time…</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been saved yet again, which caused her feelings for him to skyrocket, and her heart was filled with so much warmth. Not to mention that it was just the two of them right now, her heart was racing unbearably, and yet he didn't realize it at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Would it really hurt you to be a bit more conscious of me…?</p>
<p class="null-p">While she felt annoyed, her face started to burn up. Trying to make it so that he wouldn't be able to see that, Mao averted her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, why're you looking away like that?" "…Not your problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she didn't feel that way at all, her tone suddenly turned sharp. On top of that, she started blushing furiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm totally done for…</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much she tried to deny her own feelings, it didn't work. She made up excuses saying that she already lost against Sayuki, and focused only her job as a means of escaping reality, but her feelings wouldn't leave her alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I really can't give up on Kiryuu…</p>
<p class="null-p">Women really are greedy creatures. Whether it be her hobbies, her work, or her loved one, Mao didn't want to lose anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">* "…Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Monday passed in the blink of an eye, and classes came to an end. Mao was on her way home when her feet came to a sudden halt. Her eyes were drawn towards the various assortments of chocolate in the various store windows she was walking past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, it's that season again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fourteenth of February would come soon. It had slipped her mind because of her work, but that day was actually an important day for every adolescent girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, Kiryuu helped me out before, so it'd make sense for me to give him some chocolate, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Who was she even making that excuse to? She started searching for one to give to the boy she liked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The question is… Do I get store-bought, or make some homemade…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her injured finger was steadily recovering, and the doctors planned on removing the bandage tomorrow. Since she had until the day after tomorrow, making homemade chocolate was definitely doable. The year before, she had prepared some store-bought chocolate, thinking that homemade would be going too far, but she couldn't muster up the courage to give it to him. Which should she choose now? Easy but emotionless store-bought chocolate, or homemade chocolate filled with her love…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-Well, I'll think about that another time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She decided to think about it later, and entered the store. "…Ah, club president?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, if it isn't Nanjou-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when Mao made up her mind and walked inside, she spotted someone familiar. She wasn't standing at the front of the store, where the special offers were, but rather in the back, with all sorts of sweets. Just like Mao, Tokihara Sayuki was wearing a coat on top of her uniform, a bag slung over her</p>
<p class="null-p">shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence meeting you here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly speaking, that didn't matter at all. Mao's attention was immediately attracted to the object in the girl's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chocolate…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention it was 500 grams of it. This clearly wasn't for herself. "Are those ingredients for Valentine's chocolate?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I thought I should try making homemade chocolate this year." "What about your exams?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am up to date with my studies, so no worries there."</p>
<p class="null-p">The exam was planned for the 15th, but knowing Sayuki, she should have no problems. If anything, the fact that she was preparing chocolate was more important.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that chocolate for Kiryuu?" "That's right. Just like you, right?" "I don't really…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I'm not the club president anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but I can't just stop calling you that. You're still the club president to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just call me what's most comfortable for you to say. Something like 'Sayuki-chan'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a bit weird…" Mao made a wry smile, and Sayuki responded with a gentle grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I have to pay for this, so I'll be on my way-" "Ah, wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao stopped Sayuki in her tracks. There was one thing she needed to ask no matter what, and she had been too scared to do so until now. She was scared of finding out if the boy and Sayuki were going out or not. But if she didn't ask now, then handing over the chocolate would be impossible after all-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Club president, are you going out with Kiryuu?" "Huh…?" Sayuki's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">She observed Mao with a surprised gaze, choosing her next words carefully. "The other day, Keiki-kun told me that he liked me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had prepared herself for this, but hearing the words straight out of the girl's mouth hurt more than expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then these two are going out after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the only logical explanation. She pressed her hand against her chest, trying to suppress the pain and the tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But we aren't going out." "…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard these unexpected words, Mao's face shot up. "What… Does that mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki liked Sayuki, and they weren't going out. Met with this contradiction, Mao waited for what Sayuki said next, which she said with a slightly sad</p>
<p class="null-p">smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun rejected me."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: The Story of Wanting to Win over a High School Boy during Valentine's</p>
<p class="null-p">The fourteenth of February is a very special day. Girls all over the world give chocolate to the boy they are interested in, and boys spend the day excited with expectations and hopes that they'll receive chocolate from the girl they're interested in. On one side, love blooms like sweet chocolate, and on the other, love comes to an end with a cruel and bitter aftertaste. The winners of the day, receiving chocolate from a cute girl, gather the resentful gazes of the losers, who shed tears of defeat and howl in the face of despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for our Young Kiryuu, who was in the middle of that-As you could guess, he belonged to the losers. If there was someone who'd be willing to give him chocolate to begin with, then he wouldn't have spent his entire life without a girlfriend. The only person who would brighten his day and give him chocolate was his little sister Mizuha. For example, when he was still in middle school…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu… Urk… I didn't get any chocolate this year either…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, what a shame." She cheered up her dejected older brother. "Since I feel bad for you, how about you take some chocolate from your cute little sister?" She would say while giving him a pack of homemade chocolate.</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't happen that year alone. Every single year, she would prepare chocolate for Keiki. For him, Valentine's meant he wouldn't receive chocolate at school, but from his little sister at home. It was mostly thanks to Mizuha that Keiki didn't come to hate this Valentine's day, cursed by so many loners. And thus-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Another year, huh…?" Keiki made a wry smile when his phone alarm woke him up.</p>
<p class="null-p">The date on the screen showed the fourteenth of February. It was the exciting yet heart-wrenching Valentine's day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun, please accept this!" "Thanks, Koharu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki arrived at school, he spotted Koharu handing wrapped chocolates to Shouma. Must be homemade, he figured as he inspected the heart-shaped box.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope it suits your tastes, but… Knowing Shouma-kun, you'll probably get a lot of chocolate…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your chocolate will always be the best to me, Koharu-chan." "Shouma-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan…"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_11.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">The two of them looked at each other. The atmosphere was practically screaming 'Just kiss already!', and the chocolate seemed close to melting from the heat. Keiki looked at the two and sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy for you, but you're in the middle of the street…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just to make things clear, the two of them were flirting right in front of the school gate. Naturally, the students passing by all gave them dubious looks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah!? What was I doing, and in a public place no less…!" Koharu ran away, hiding her face from the embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, Keiki. Morning." "Morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Shouma were left behind, setting foot inside the school building together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai sure is bold, isn't she? To think she'd hand over the chocolate in such a public space."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess that her head was too busy with the actual chocolate to pay attention to her surroundings. Her face was beet red."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your girlfriend's a bit too cute, isn't she?" Keiki felt jealous from the bottom of his heart. "Also, can you stop grinning like that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't help it. This is the first time I've gotten chocolate from my girlfriend. I have my own trauma from Valentine's day, alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Trauma…? Oh right, when your older sisters cosplayed as chocolate people…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A long time ago, he had been chased by his older sisters, who were saying 'Eat me!', which caused said trauma. That being said, his current girlfriend was a great help in melting that trauma away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope you get some too, Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I don't, I have my 'Promised Winner's Chocolate'." "The heck is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a beautiful girl who gives me chocolate every year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mizuha-chan, right." Shouma nodded with a smile. "That reminds me, Mizuha-chan isn't with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's got duty today, it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">They talked about this and that, and soon arrived at the front entrance, standing near the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe you've gotten some secret chocolate from a shy girl inside your shoe box?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if, haha." Keiki laughed and opened the shoe locker. When he did so, he spotted an unfamiliar object inside. "…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sadly, it wasn't chocolate. Even without picking it up, it obviously was a girl's underwear-namely, erotic black panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why would panties be in here!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Such objects normally didn't belong there. On top of that, there was a small piece of paper hidden inside the black fabric. It read-</p>
<p class="null-p">'Whose panties might these be? If you guess correctly, you will receive a reward.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is going on!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A sudden quiz greeted Keiki. It was provocation from the criminal who put panties in his shoe locker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing at all!" Keiki panicked and stuffed the panties into his blazer's right pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">If someone saw him with these, he'd be labeled an underwear thief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whose panties are these!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet again, he was tasked with finding the sender of the panties. Keiki felt slightly nostalgic, and started thinking about how to tackle this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki made his way to the classroom, thinking about the panties. "Someone put panties in my shoe locker…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike Cinderella's panties, the panties this time were jet black, and quite sexy. Who was the owner of the panties this time?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this Mizuha's doing again? But… back then she only left the panties there accidentally, not because she wanted to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no proof that she was the criminal this time, so it was too early to jump to that conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, I'll need to look into it some more."</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, there wasn't much thinking needed, as he could narrow the criminal down to the perverted girls he knew. There shouldn't be any other girl who would do such a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For starters, I don't think it could be Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase Airi hated men, so she would never put her own panties in a boy's shoe locker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think it'd be Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou Mao is a rotten fujoshi who loves BL. She surely wouldn't feel any</p>
<p class="null-p">sense of joy or excitement from leaving random panties around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That leaves only Yuika-chan, Sayuki-senpai, Mizuha, and Takasaki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika had set similar precedents to this. Sayuki is a pervert who would feel excited by doing this. Mizuha is an exhibitonist, so her doing some weird roleplay like this was not unthinkable. As for Shiho, she might try to break apart Keiki's relationships, since she gets excited by being NTR'd.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Fujimoto-san might be a possibility, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She might be turning her weird desire to trade underwear into this weird game. That would mean he couldn't exclude her, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, why do I have to worry about something like this on Valentine's Day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">All the other boys were already busy discussing the chocolate they got or didn't get, and the girls were cheering for each other, or teasing those who would be handing out chocolate today. The entire classroom was talking about Valentine's, and yet Keiki had to worry about panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, carrying them around all day is too dangerous, and just throwing them away might create another problem, so the best thing I can do is give them back to the owner."</p>
<p class="null-p">Panties might just be the most dangerous object to possess in the world. "…Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki raised his head and spotted Mao, who was standing next to him. She was still wearing her coat, bag in hand, so she probably came over before going to her own seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nanjou. Morning." "…Morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?" Keiki was slightly confused by Mao's delayed response.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something was off with Mao. She seemed anxious about something, like she was unable to calm down. It was rare for her to come greet him in the classroom like that. Keiki figured she might have some business with him, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't even respond. On top of that…</p>
<p class="null-p">Why's she fidgeting like that? …Ah!? Could she actually…?</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, a single explanation popped up in Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Not be wearing any panties right now because she put them in my shoe locker!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had just excluded Nanjou Mao from the list of possible candidates. However, the way she is fidgeting and acting right now could be explained by her not wearing any panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, I can't exactly go ask her 'Nanjou, are you not wearing panties right now?', can I…?</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way for him to confirm it. If he turned out to be wrong, that would be categorized as sexual harassment. Thus, he could only try to figure it out through normal conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that reminds me, they took off the bandage on your finger, Nanjou." "Eh? …Ah, yeah. They said it'd be better in two or three days or so." "Did they take off your panties too while they were at it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She apparently felt danger for her body, and she quickly pulled her skirt down. Her expression was distorted in disgust, and she fixed Keiki with a cold gaze. It appears that Keiki's choice of words was flat-out awful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I'm wearing them. Can you drop the sexual harassment this early in the morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess she really isn't the criminal after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">That reaction didn't seem to be acting. Then again, Keiki never really doubted Mao that much, so he just gave up on assuming it was her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, did you want something from me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nevermind. Stupid Kiryuu." Mao left behind a silent insult and walked over to her own seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">She kept her cold and indifferent expression as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was that about…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Understanding Mao was as impossible as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Lunch break arrived, and Keiki had still not made any progress. Mao still seemed angry because of what happened earlier, and was still glaring at him. Keiki enjoyed the boxed lunch Mizuha made for him, and immediately ran away from his seat. Before searching for the criminal, he decided to get some juice.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stepped out of the classroom and was walking down the hallway when two female students appeared in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Found Keiki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't think you can escape from us now, Kiryuu-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan? Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To his right, a blonde-haired Koga Yuika appeared, and to his left was the twin-tailed girl Nagase Airi. Keiki was surprised to see two girls appear in front of him, so he took a step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This might be a bit sudden, but please come with us for a second, Keiki- senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your cute junior is telling you to, so just do it, Kiryuu-senpai!" "Eh, wha… Where are we going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not knowing what was going on, Keiki was dragged along by the two girls. He followed them, and they entered an empty room in the classroom building. Yuika finally let go of Keiki's hand and took out a wrapped box with a pink ribbon on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here. This is Valentine's chocolate from Yuika." "T-Thanks…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better be thankful. This is chocolate that beats all the other chocolate you've gotten so far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be fair, this is the first chocolate I've gotten from any girl besides Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Yuika is your first? Hmm… is that so…? So Yuika is your first… Ehehe…" Yuika grinned happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seriously, this girl is as cute as ever.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_12.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">After that, someone tugged on his uniform from the opposite side. "Um, Kiryuu-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san?" "This is from me." "Eh? Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The package Airi handed him was a different color, with a blue ribbon on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay? I've been in your care, and I made these as thanks for the notebook."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now Keiki had received chocolate twice in a single year. This was a new high score.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…And I'm sorry about before." "Ah, don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was talking about the time she had dragged Keiki off to the student council office. Since she was angry for Yuika's sake, Keiki couldn't hold it against her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need for you to worry about it, Yuika." "Hmm… Sounds suspicious…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, Kiryuu-senpai, Yuika and I made this chocolate together, okay? Keep that in mind when you eat it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right! This chocolate is filled with Yuika and Airi's love, so you can't leave anything behind!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I didn't put any love in there, okay!?" Airi denied Yuika's declaration with a beet-red face, like a true tsundere.</p>
<p class="null-p">That in itself was a sight to behold, but… "This chocolate… is homemade?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was really shocked after that realization.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just imagining two cute juniors making chocolate for me… Yeah, this is pretty great. I feel satisfied just from that.</p>
<p class="null-p">…No, that's not important.</p>
<p class="null-p">I've got two prime suspects in front of me right now, so I need to investigate them.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't afford to waste this chance. Maybe he could figure out if Yuika was actually the person who left the panties behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Yuika-chan." "Yes, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is your favorite color of panties?" "Excuse me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Black or white. That's all I need to know." "Keiki-senpai!?" Yuika looked at Keiki in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai, what kind of question is that!?" Airi joined in, flustered. Maybe Keiki's phrasing wasn't the best.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't get the wrong idea. I just want to use this as reference for my White Day gift."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you plan on giving Yuika panties as a White Day present, Keiki- senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you were a pervert, but I didn't think it would be this bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His underclassmen both took some distance from Keiki. He was being treated like a pervert, undoubtedly. They were looking at him like trash on the side of the road.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, since these two don't seem to be the criminals, I guess I can tell them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki explained the reason, as he would have not preferred being treated like a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for asking that weird question. The thing is, a girl's panties appeared in my shoe locker, and I'm searching for the owner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There were panties in your shoe locker?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai, please come up with a more believable lie." "I know it sounds super bad, but it's the truth."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even now, the panties were inside his pocket as proof. Though he'd be labeled a pervert if he took them out now, so he kept them stored in there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you doubted Yuika, huh, Keiki-senpai?" "Well, you've already put your bra in there before." "…Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehe~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's eyes shot open. She gave Yuika a 'You're kidding, right?' look, but Yuika smiled it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So then, do you two have any idea who it could have been?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, Yuika doesn't know anything." "Same here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I figured as much."</p>
<p class="null-p">The criminal had probably been careful with their actions, so it was rather unrealistic to think that someone could have seen anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but…" Yuika spoke up, like she had remembered something. "I saw Fujimoto-san loitering around there this morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san was?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. When Yuika called out to her, she ran away. It was in front of the second-year shoe lockers…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was valuable information. Loitering around like that sure sounded suspicious. Right around the time he received this critical information, his phone vibrated in his pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who had sent the email was the person they had just been talking about. The contents of the email read 'Emergency, come to the student council office right now', asking Keiki to come over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, come on in."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki arrived at the student council, Ayano greeted him. "Sit here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">He did as he was told, sitting on the sofa inside the room. Slightly nervous, Keiki spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why did you call me here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A question for you, Kiryuu-kun. What day is it today?" "Eh? …Um, Valentine's Day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Correct. Since it's Valentine's, I made some chocolate cake for you. Please try it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you not hungry, by chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had just been craving something sweet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perfect. I'll prepare it right away." Ayano said with a delighted tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't take long for the comfortable scent of tea to reach Keiki's nostrils. "Fujimoto-san's homemade chocolate…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's hobby was to make sweets. She was quite confident in her talent, and the apple pie she made before was magnificent. There was no doubt about it. The cake this time must be delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is…!?" Keiki's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't believe the sight in front of him. What Ayano brought was a beautiful chocolate cake that looked like something a professional patissier would have made.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sure looks amazing, alright!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Coated with chocolate, it emitted an awe-inspiring radiance. The layers</p>
<p class="null-p">alternated between dough and cream, creating a beautiful pattern. As always, Ayano's work looked good enough to put in a store.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I worked really hard this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't you work a bit too… Hold on, why so close!?" Keiki nearly in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ayano finished preparing the cake, she sat right next to Keiki, close enough to touch him.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_13.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Was she always sitting this close!? Wait, is she trying to sniff me!?</p>
<p class="null-p">If anything, Ayano's scent was too stimulating, and it made Keiki tense up. However, the girl didn't even seem to notice Keiki's troubles. She just picked up the plate, stabbed the fork into the cake, and held out a piece towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun… Open wide." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to feed you. I read that this is the perfect way to make Valentine's Day chocolate even better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of article did you read, Fujimoto-san?" "Eat up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Thanks for the food."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano was going this far for him, so Keiki made up his mind and just put the piece of cake in his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is…!?" "How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Way too delicious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, Ayano-san's cake was top-notch. The taste of chocolate matched perfectly with the sweet texture of the dough. This cake was more delicious than anything Keiki had tried before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'd like to try this at my own pace." "Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano seemed satisfied with feeding Keiki once, and she handed him the plate and fork. Keiki took a sip of the tea and enjoyed the rest of the cake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the food. That was hella good." "I'm glad you liked it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now I definitely need to repay you for it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe your underwear after you've worn it for the whole day?" "Anything but that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Keiki still had some time to consider his present for White Day. More than his own underwear, Keiki was curious to find out about the underwear in his shoe locker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Fujimoto-san." "What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard you were loitering around the second-year shoe lockers this morning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fueh!?" Her shoulders jumped when Keiki said that. "I-I-I-I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've ever seen you this flustered, Fujimoto-san…" Her reaction was very suspicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is she… actually the criminal who put the panties in there?</p>
<p class="null-p">If he pressured her some more, she might just confess to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, a cute Junior of mine saw you around there. Were you doing anything bad, by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you tell me now, I won't get angry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuuu…" Thus, Fujimoto-san confessed. "The thing is, I wanted to put chocolate in the shoe locker of the boy I like…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chocolate? Not panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Why would I put panties in there?" "No, it's nothing… Please continue."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really only wanted to put chocolate in there… But when I was standing in front of the shoe locker, I felt really embarrassed, so I ended up just walking back and forth…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew that Ayano had someone she held one-sided feelings for. While she tried to muster up the courage to put chocolate in that boy's shoe locker, Yuika must have spotted her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So did you manage to give it to him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yep, he said it was delicious." She blushed ever-so-slightly and smiled happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appears that she had safely managed to give that boy the chocolate. However, Keiki was still no closer to finding out who put the black panties inside his shoe locker, now that Fujimoto Ayano had turned out to be innocent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after, Keiki left the student council office behind him and made his way to the library office. Since barely anyone was present, he easily found a place to sit, and there he started thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… Why can't I find that criminal…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this situation with no more hints, Keiki had run into a wall. All he had were the black panties and the short memo left behind for him. Apparently, he would receive a prize for finding the criminal, but he didn't have much trust in that for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since I get a reward, they want me to find them, right…</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, then what reason is there for this game? What would they gain from this? If Keiki knew, he might be able to get closer to the criminal, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"-What are you making that complicated face for?" "Woah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with this joyful voice, Keiki was embraced from behind. Arms wrapped around his neck, and when he turned his face sideways, he met the gaze of a grinning female student.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai?" "Yahooo, Keiki-kun~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who assaulted Keiki was the former student council president Takasaki Shiho. Her long, wavy hair hung down her shoulders, swaying gently as she talked with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing here? I don't mind giving you a big hug if you're feeling lonely, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're already hugging me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt her soft chest pressing against his back, and she was close enough for an average boy to assume that she might have feelings for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on. Couldn't you be a bit happier to see me?" "You just scared me to death, that's all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, was Shiho-senpai's hug a bit too stimulating?" She flashed a grin and</p>
<p class="null-p">pulled away from Keiki. "By the way, did you get chocolate from someone, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a secret."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, judging from that reaction, you've gotten a few. Ten? Twenty?" "Why do you think I would get that many?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you got some from Airi-chan and Ayano-chan, right?" "Huh? How do you know about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"These two really love you, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I wonder about that." Keiki felt a bit embarrassed upon hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought that they had gotten along well when he was helping out as a temporary student council member, and he was happy that the feeling was mutual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I really like you as well, Keiki-kun." "Thanks …"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, let me give you some chocolate churros as proof." "Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki received chocolate yet again. Ahh, how happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Keiki-kun, what was that complicated expression for just now? Are you worried about something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I was thinking about a test." "What kind of test?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A test to see who could have put black panties in my shoe locker."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you maybe elaborate on it some more? That sounds like one hell of a question."</p>
<p class="null-p">As a matter of fact, Shiho was a suspect as well. However, considering how</p>
<p class="null-p">curious she sounded, it seemed almost impossible that she was the criminal.</p>
<p class="null-p">So it isn't Takasaki-senpai either? "Ah, speaking of panties…" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A little while ago, Tokihara-san asked me what kind of underwear you</p>
<p class="null-p">liked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of question is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That clearly isn't a topic you should discuss at school. However, Keiki couldn't help but be curious as to what Shiho's response was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did you tell her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… I think I said 'Lewd erotic types always win boys over', probably." "So you did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, do you actually dislike that type of underwear?" "I'll refrain from answering that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course he didn't hate them, but he preferred not revealing his interests like that. Naturally, prim and proper ones were great as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did she say after that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was like 'I'll get some erotic underwear that'll make Keiki-kun super ineterested' with a brimming smile."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she prepare them, then? Keiki couldn't help but feel curious. Of course, not because of the underwear itself, but because of the type of underwear she bought.</p>
<p class="null-p">So lewd and erotic underwear… Maybe it was these panties?</p>
<p class="null-p">The chances were not slim, for sure. Indeed, this information might be his greatest hint yet for finding the criminal.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Classes ended, and Keiki quickly grabbed his bag to leave the classroom. He walked down the halls and soon arrived at the all-too-familiar clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work today." "Ah, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have been studying, as she was seated on a chair instead of the tatami floor, facing the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're quite early today, huh?" "I came here in a rush."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really must have wanted to see me." "Indeed. There's something I'd like to confirm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, what might that be?" The upperclassmen tilted her head, slightly puzzled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was certain of his victory, and he flashed a confident grin as he continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you put panties in my shoe locker this morning?" "Huh? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki made a confused face, causing Keiki to let out a baffled sound himself. Normally, this should have been the part where things would get</p>
<p class="null-p">cleared up, at least in some mystery novel. This was the exact opposite reaction than he expected. The detective had lost his lead, and he started trying to confirm the issue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you didn't put them there, Sayuki-senpai?" "I wouldn't do something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How could this happen…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It appears that Keiki had jumped to an inaccurate conclusion. Since he had no way of talking his way out of this, he was forced to spill the beans.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmmm? So when you came to school, you found a girl's panties in your shoe locker? This sounds quite intriguing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is most definitely not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you thought I was the criminal." "I have no excuses."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It's true that I've prepared lewd erotic underwear at least." "…What did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm even wearing it right now." "Excusez-moi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you really want to see it, I don't mind showing you. However, that will come with a heavy responsibility."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'll politely decline for now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that rumoured underwear was indeed tempting, but the 'responsibility' she spoke of scared Keiki too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this is great timing. I had some business with you as well, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. It's something very important." She started grinning as she stood up from her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a childish 'There~', she embraced Keiki. It was a hug filled with love, and she pressed her large chest against Keiki's, rubbing their cheeks together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai. What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This much should be fine, right?" She raised her head and smiled. "After all, I was your first love, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was true. Tokihara Sayuki had been Keiki's first love. However, he only noticed those feelings after their trip to the mountains. When he talked to Mao on the balcony that night, Keiki felt like he was close to figuring something out, and he went back to his room and confirmed his feelings. As a result, he came to the conclusion that he had special feelings for Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">More than that, he might have already been in love with her when he saw her sitting on that bench.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun, what did you like about me?" "Well… A lot of things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tried to be vague about it, but Sayuki wouldn't let him get away with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How kind you were to a junior, how hard you worked in every area, how perfect you looked on the outside, but also how weak you were on the inside. I thought that all of that was cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Oh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For some reason, hearing it out loud sure is embarrassing…" "You're the one who made me say it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki let go of Keiki, possibly because she felt satisfied. The sweet and heart-throbbing atmosphere from before was gone, and the upperclassman was pouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And yet you rejected me and went off cheating on me with another girl." "That was cheating?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are a sadistic bastard." "I am not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, it's an honor to have been your first, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not phrase it like that? If someone heard you say it that way, they'd definitely get the wrong idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At least let me complain a bit. You walked away from the true heroine route to change your mind and go down a sub-route right at the very end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the reason Keiki had rejected Sayuki's confession. When Keiki sorted through his feelings, at the end where Sayuki should have stood was now another girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you ran off to another girl after getting tired of me. If you had chosen me, these breasts would be yours alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again, phrasing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know it's too late to think about it, but I wonder if there could have been a future where we were together if I had made a different choice somewhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Maybe."</p>
<p class="null-p">A future like that could have happened. Going out with her, falling in love even deeper despite her fetish, and building a happy family sometime down the line. The fact that they could dream of a future like that was proof of how close they were. However, just as she had said, it was just a what-if scenario.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Sayuki-senpai. I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine." The girl gave a calm smile and put her hand on his cheek. "You can't do anything about your true feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though that's the case, I don't plan on giving up on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought as much. That's about what I expected from a masochist."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. So make sure you don't get rejected. The instant you show an opening, I'll be there to exploit it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll try my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was his plan to begin with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, what business did you have with me?" "Ah, I almost forgot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki walked over to a nearby chair and took out a wrapped object with a red ribbon on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since it's Valentine's today, I made this for you… Though maybe you don't want mine now that you have another girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll gladly accept it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki would always be happy about receiving chocolate. This is one thing, and that is another.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki left the clubroom and headed down towards the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, I still didn't find out who these black panties belong to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the prime suspect Sayuki turned out to be innocent. It felt like Keiki was being toyed around with. The sun had already started to set, so he decided to search for the criminal the next day. But he abruptly came to a stop right in front of the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He spotted a girl with reddish-brown hair and a sidetail in front of him. She was wearing the same coat she had been wearing this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo." She gave him a short greeting. "Nanjou? What are you doing here?" "Waiting for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For me? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… you know, there's this thing…" "What are you talking about, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't figure out what Nanjou was talking about. Why would she be waiting for him here this late?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on a second." Mao said, and opened the zipper to her bag. After that, she took out a rectangular shaped object.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mm." She averted her eyes and held the box towards Keiki. "Chocolate… Today is Valentine's after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Ohh… Thanks…" He accepted the chocolate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than being wrapped cutely, it seemed to be charming instead. It had a blue ribbon on top of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is this homemade?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"G-Got a problem with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was just wondering because you just got your bandage off." "It doesn't hurt anymore. Totally fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see." Keiki was relieved that she wasn't forcing herself. "…Ah? Is that why you were acting weird this morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. You helped me out earlier, so I wanted to pay you back." "Sorry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had completely ruined the mood with his question about the panties then. Just as Mao had said, he decided to be more delicate about his questions in the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, I'll enjoy it later." "Yup…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I've received chocolate from you, I need to repay you later." "Just to let you know, this isn't obligatory chocolate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like you, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuuh!?" Keiki's eyes shot up and glued themselves to Mao's.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression looked as displeased as always, but her cheeks were slightly red, and her eyes were unsure as she waited for Keiki's response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really…?" Keiki still couldn't believe it, so he had to ask again. "You never noticed? How dense can you be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she forbade Keiki from having a lover of the opposite sex, she quickly agreed to Shouma and Koharu being a couple, and there were few times when Keiki had gotten his hopes up before. Thinking back to them now, and considering Mao's confession, he could tell that she was saying the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, I didn't think that Nanjou would like me…</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she always seemed to be in such a bad mood, not ever being honest about it, Keiki thought there was never anything else but friendship. In the end, she was just a tsundere, and not being able to voice your feelings is the trademark of a tsundere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu…" "Y-Yesh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I made that chocolate, I was thinking about you." "Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About what kind of face you would make, what kind of reaction you would have. I grinned to myself, and I felt anxious, like a manga heroine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've liked you for a long time, okay? Ever since our first year… When you saved me from becoming a library committee member." She spoke with a distant gaze voicing her passionate feelings. "I know that all the girls around you are cute and honest, but I definitely won't lose to them when it comes to my feelings for you, so-" She put one hand on her chest and spoke as clearly as she could. "Don't choose anybody else! Please go out with me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an impactful and touching confession. It was clear that she was serious about this, if only for the fact that she could rarely be honest with herself. Of</p>
<p class="null-p">course, Keiki thought that she was cute, and she was charming enough that he wanted to embrace her right away. However-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, he couldn't respond to her feelings. "I have someone I like, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see." Mao looked down. "Well, I figured as much." "Huh? You knew?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I always thought it was suspicious. When I watch you whenever you talk with that girl, it becomes super obvious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, I didn't expect that. I thought you liked the club president. But you rejected her too, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you heard about that too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It appears that Sayuki and Mao had already talked things out. There was no doubt that Keiki once had feelings for Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why did you let her do all of that then? You never resisted being hugged or getting scribbles all over your face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, she was venting stress." "She was just letting out stress?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing is, because of her family circumstances, Sayuki-senpai had to seal</p>
<p class="null-p">away her masochistic tendencies for a while…" "Oh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And because she had to hold back that entire time, she warned me that she</p>
<p class="null-p">might just push me down on the spot if I didn't let her do all of that." "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since she had confessed to Keiki, Sayuki had suppressed her own fetish,</p>
<p class="null-p">acting like a perfect girl. That apparently had exploded in her face, and she needed some way to vent out all the stress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I wasn't the biggest fan of it, but since it was partially my fault, I didn't want her to fail her exams and all of that. That's why I made the condition that we could keep it up until after the exams. Without that, she'd probably never stop."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Tokihara Sayuki was a helpless pervert. But Keiki also couldn't ignore the problem since he was partially responsible for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So that's why you were flirting around with the club president." "What did you think it was?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you had awakened to sadism, and that you two were a happy-go- lucky S&M couple now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a terrible misunderstanding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I think you have some sadistic tendencies, Kiryuu." "Huh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You make girls get their hopes up, only to disappoint them?" "You're making it sound like you've experienced that…" "Because I have." Mao pouted, and took a glance at Keiki's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a girl who likes you so much, yet you're not even aware of her…" "N-Nanjou…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki swallowed his breath. Once she threw away her tsundere attribute, Mao's was dangerously cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Of course I was conscious of you." "Wha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There were many times when my heart started racing because of you, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When we went on that date to collect data for you, I was super nervous when I saw you all dressed up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I… see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When we went to the pool and the sea, whenever you got too close to me, my heart started beating crazy fast."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh…? So you felt that way? You're a real lecher, Kiryuu." Mao lobbed an insult Keiki's way, but she seemed happy nonetheless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And when we went on that trip earlier." "…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you grabbed my son in the bath-" "I don't need to be reminded of that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the most exciting and dangerous situation Keiki had been in with her,</p>
<p class="null-p">but the person herself immediately brushed it aside. "Anyway, I always saw you as a girl, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. That's good to know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because if things don't work out with the girl you like, then I can go on the offensive, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pffft!? N-Nanjou!?" Keiki was thrown off-course, and Mao let out a snicker in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know how bad I am at giving up, right? I won't stop just because you tell me to. I'll become an even better woman, and I'll make you only have eyes for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Please don't overdo it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't good. It wasn't just Yuika and Sayuki, but now Mao had also announced that she wouldn't give up even now. Keiki envisioned a future even more troublesome than their previous perverted actions, and he started sweating profusely. He took a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his face. Mao watched this with wide-open eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? What are you looking at me like that for? Is there something on my face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you wiping your face with panties?" "Huh? …Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki finally realized his fatal mistake. He didn't have a handkerchief in his right pocket. That was where the jet-black panties were. Thus, he was currently wiping his cheek with a girl's underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't tell me… You stole this…!?" "Wha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Pervert! Kiryuu, you pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It isn't what it looks like, okay!? I did not receive these panties through illegal means!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you opening them and holding them towards me!?" "In order to prove my innocence!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wanted to prove his innocence, so he closed in on Mao with the panties in hand. Of course, from an outsider's perspective, it totally looked like a highschool boy closing in on an innocent girl with panties in his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt a vague sense of discomfort, and looked down at the panties in his hand. Now that he opened them up and got a good look at them…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are these panties actually…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He faintly remembered seeing the design on these panties before. Which made sense, since one of his current subjects had shown them to him not too long ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki sent the criminal a short 'Where are you right now?' email, and he received a brief 'Classroom' back. Keiki quickly made his way to the 2E classroom. Said classroom was colored orange by the setting sun, and a single girl stood inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're late, Nii-san. I almost got tired of waiting." "Well, I had to take a lot of detours."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you ran into all the other girls, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pretty much." Keiki decided to just confess to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stood in front of Mizuha and took the panties out of his pocket. "I'm here to return these."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did they make you excited?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Mainly because I was terrified of being found out while walking around with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">If he had been found, he'd die a horrible death-Socially, that is. "So why did you put your panties in my shoe locker?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you've been so popular as of late, I figured that you'd get a lot of chocolate today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhmmm… And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you had my panties with you, even if you got chocolate from someone else, you'd only be able to think about me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you put these familiar panties in there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The mystery had been solved. Basically, the criminal never had any intention of hiding herself. The only reason it took Keiki so long to figure it out was because he never took a good look at the panties in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't think her flashing her panties at me would be the biggest clue.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason this entire test came into being was because Mizuha felt anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just wanted to confirm: You weren't walking around school all day without any panties on, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No worries, I'm wearing them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that. I would have had a heart attack otherwise."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing underwear is the bare minimum of what it takes to make you a rational human being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I guess we should go home, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second, Nii-san. I still haven't given you your prize."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, you wrote something like that… right. So why were you waiting here anyway?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They could have done this just as easily at home. "Because I wanted to give it to you at school." "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That'll make me seem more like a classmate, right?" "What do you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So with that said… Here, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside this classroom illuminated by the setting sun, Mizuha offered Keiki a small wrapping with chocolate in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're love chocolates this year as well." She said with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">How long has she been giving me love chocolate?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was the chocolate she had given him every year filled with such profound love? From how she made it sound, these feelings for Keiki had been a long time coming.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe even… from the very beginning?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's face burnt up just from imagining it. It made him worried that the chocolate would melt from the heat. But that didn't change anything. After all, on this very moment, on this special Valentine's Day, for the first time in Keiki's life, he had received chocolate from the girl he had feelings for.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: The Perverts Fell in Love so They Went on a Double Date</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had only recently realized his feelings for Mizuha. The trigger was the trip they went on just the other day. Mizuha had been suffering from a fever, and when she took off her clothes to let him wipe off the sweat, he was entranced by her beauty. He tried not thinking about it too much, but this emotion inside of him was definitely not something you would have towards family. Shortly afterwards, he came to the realization that he had started seeing his little sister as a member of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once Rintarou started approaching Mizuha more aggressively, Keiki started to feel jealousy whenever he heard about it, or even when he saw them together. Shouma said it was like a father having his daughter stolen away, but that was incorrect. In fact, Keiki simply didn't like that the girl he had feelings for was being wooed like that. After the day he found out Cinderella's identity, was confessed to by Mizuha, had his first kiss stolen by her, and even unravelled the truth about the two of them not being related by blood, he started to grow more and more conscious of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had changed from a cute little sister to a girl he was interested in. At first, he was shocked. The girl he had seen only as a little sister was now a member of the opposite sex. His heart raced whenever she showed him her naked body, it would burn with jealousy when she talked to someone else, and it would jump for joy upon seeing her happy smile. All of these feelings intertwined, he soon became unable to ignore them, and was eventually forced to accept them.</p>
<p class="null-p">After always receiving affection from Mizuha, Keiki became unable to see</p>
<p class="null-p">her only as a little sister. Even now, just seeing her made him want to embrace her. To hold her tightly in his arms and kiss her. However, that was impossible, as they were not dating yet. As a boy, he was trying to hold back all of his desires. And yet-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Zzz…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She moved over today again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl he just so happened to be conscious of had snuck into his bed again. "She's done this every day as of late…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the fifteenth of February, and Mizuha was sleeping in her brother's room yet again, using him as a hugging pillow. Naturally, this situation had happened several times in the past, but the number had increased significantly as of late. She still seemed to be hung up on that one time Keiki ended up stranded in the snowy mountains, so this seemed to be a safety measure to make sure he wouldn't leave her like her parents did.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, as the proud siscon he proclaimed himself to be, this was an honor for him, but now that he had come to understand his feelings for her, Keiki was more like a hungry wolf. Keiki had trouble holding himself back when he looked at her being all defenseless like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She doesn't even know about my feelings. She's just sleeping so happily…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like he had said that before. That was right after he found out about Mizuha's perversion. Keiki came back from his bath and found Mizuha sleeping on his bed, and complained about her being so defenseless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not fair. I can't get angry at you when you're sleeping so comfortably." Her sleeping face looked like an angel. It made Keiki want to assault her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he put up with these desires by poking at her defenseless cheek, and she returned a cute groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… Ah, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning, Mizuha." "Good morning, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still laying on the bed, Mizuha gave him a drowsy greeting. Great manners as always, even towards family. There's never anything wrong with a proper greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So tell me, why exactly are you in my bed?" "Because I wanted to sleep with Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I like that you're being honest." "You won't get angry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's still cold outside, so a bit of extra warmth won't hurt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. In the end, you're still kind to your little sister. That's why I love you, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you too, Mizuha." He gently rubbed her head, and Mizuha smiled happily in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">To them, 'I love you' was a normal greeting, but Keiki had yet to confess this blooming feeling inside of his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd love to stay like this a bit longer, but we'll be late at this rate."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha got up from the bed, slightly reluctantly. She was wearing fluffy, not- too-thick pajamas. "I'll go get changed and make breakfast. Make sure not to fall asleep again, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Satisfied by her older brother's response, Mizuha left the room. Keiki watched her walk off and let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Man, my little sister is really cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He tried to remain calm, but his heart had been racing the entire time. After everything she had done, she couldn't exactly complain even if Keiki couldn't hold himself back any longer. He felt like he deserved praise for having not already leapt at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though maybe Mizuha might be okay even if I did that…</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, she had invited him once before, saying 'Let's have sex', so that would make sense. She seemed like a calm and reserved girl on the outside, but she could be quite assertive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, how should I confess to Mizuha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had always been aggressive, always pressuring Keiki to accept her. For him, bringing up the idea of dating was more difficult than he had thought. At the very least, confessing here in the house felt wrong. But where, when, and how should he do it, then? Keiki had been thinking about that a lot as of late.</p>
<p class="null-p">That same day after classes ended, he was sitting in the all-too-familiar classroom 2B, talking with Shouma and getting advice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I'm wondering when I should confess to Mizuha." "You still haven't told her, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, that's the problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But she confessed to you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she always tells me how much she likes me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why are you worrying about it that much? You both love each other, so just tell her and she'll be happy. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you still hung up on the fact that you're siblings?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's one part of it, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had thought about it many times, especially from a moral standpoint. Although they were only step-siblings, in the eyes of many, they were like family. It would be hard to confidently state that no obstacles would be in their way. Since he was looking at his little sister in that way, he was a total failure of an Onii-chan. This was definitely worse than the girls from the calligraphy club calling him a pervert. Wanting to make his little sister his lover was crossing the line that even siscons shouldn't cross.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, I came to the conclusion that, since we're not blood-related, there's no problem with it. Forget morals or the prying eyes of people around us. I love her more than it'd be worth being shaken by that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Negative thinking wouldn't get him anywhere. Even if those sorts of things would stand in their way, Keiki couldn't give up on hoping for a relationship with Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can legally get married, too, so I decided to just go with it." "Hmm? I see~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you grinning for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you've thought far enough ahead to consider marriage." "Of course. That's what comes with going out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is so like you, Keiki. But why haven't you confessed yet, then? You live together, so can't you just confess whenever you want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you're not wrong, but… since I can technically do it anytime, I'm having trouble finding the right time to do it… And I'm already happy like this, so I feel like I'll just end up getting burned if I try to take it too far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-There's a lot of things I'd like to complain about with what you've said, but to sum it up, you're scared of failing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Yuika-chan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could tell from voice alone that Koga Yuika was standing behind him. Oddly enough, Shouma was fairly calm about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It has been a while, Akiyama-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you two just greeting each other…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had to admire Shouma for not jumping in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are a helpless person, Keiki-senpai. You can't even confess, but then you reject Yuika because you have someone you like. That's pretty pathetic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That hurts…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the person you had feelings for was Mizuha-senpai, huh?" "You heard?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika knows that she's bigger than she looks at first. So you did choose based on breast size."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That wasn't it, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did everyone assume that Keiki was a big-breasts fanatic? "Koga-san is just the perfect size, if you ask me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop it, Shouma. Yuika-chan's already hiding her chest with her arms." "You're the worst…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Keiki was the one she glared at. So unreasonable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why are you in the second-year classrooms anyway, Yuika-chan?" "Scouting the enemy for revenge…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not quite. Yuika just wanted to meet Keiki-senpai. If she doesn't show her face around here regularly enough, you might forget about her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not that forgetful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enough about that! We were talking about much of a chicken you are, Senpai! Go on and confess to Mizuha-senpai so that you can get defeated already!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is it a given that I'll be rejected…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That honestly made Keiki feel like his chances of success were getting jinxed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think Koga-san is right. Mizuha-chan is really cute, so if you don't hurry up, she might get taken by someone else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't sound impossible." Yuika nodded. "Mizuha-senpai is insanely popular, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani-kun has been after her, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Rintarou's no problem. I told Mizuha that he's only in it for her breasts, so now she won't even give him the time of day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you're the kind of person who resorts to those sorts of dirty tricks, Keiki- senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that's a very nice thing to do, Keiki…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't give her away to anyone who's only in it for her breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki pushed aside any guilt gnawing away at him. Every insect who's targeting his little sister deserves to be crushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm? So you like Mizuha-senpai enough to stoop to such inhumane methods. I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it really that inhumane?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since that's how it is, Yuika won't hold back any longer. She'll go and tell Mizuha-senpai 'Keiki-senpai is a small-breasts maniac', and then-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph! Keiki-senpai should get rejected by Mizuha-senpai! And then have a collar put around his neck by Yuika!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I some kind of stray dog!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika spat her poison and walked away. However, she stopped right at the classroom's entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But if you are going to confess, then Yuika suggests inviting her out on a date." She said in a quiet voice and left the room for good.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like she was trying to help you, Keiki." "By spreading dangerous information?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She probably wants to get between the two of you, but I imagine she thinks</p>
<p class="null-p">that would cause you to dislike her." "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That would make sense. Getting angry with one breath, only to give advice</p>
<p class="null-p">right afterwards. A maiden's heart is as complicated as ever, but she was a charming girl nonetheless exactly because of that contradiction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A date does sound like a great idea, though." Keiki thought. "It's pretty standard, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means that next I have to come up with a way to invite her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Can I just go home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After separating from Shouma, Keiki sent Mizuha a short message: 'Let's walk home together'. Shortly after came the reply 'Sure', so Keiki headed to the shoe lockers. There he witnessed a dangerous scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-senpai, please come drink some tea with me today!" "Eh? Ehhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like he had seen the same scene several times already. Mizuha had finished preparations to head home, only for Rintarou to start hitting on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He sure is going at it this time. Mizuha doesn't even know how to react…" Keiki never had seen his little sister with such a wry smile on her face before.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Rintarou did not back down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it fine? I actually know a great store that sells delicious sweets." "But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a store I'd feel embarrassed to enter by myself, so think of it as saving your cute junior!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mitani-kun…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou didn't even hesitate to grab Mizuha's hand. "Grrr…" Keiki let out a grunt.</p>
<p class="null-p">If possible, he didn't want anybody to touch his precious little sister, and watching any more than this was impossible for him anyway, so he broke between the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Rintarou. We have some plans after this." "Eh? Kei-kun-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki grabbed Rintarou's arm, removing it from Mizuha. He put his arm around Mizuha's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry that I'm late. Let's go home, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah." Mizuha made a beautiful smile and snuggled up against Keiki's arm. "I'm sorry. Nii-san will only get more jealous, so I have to decline your invitation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's how it is, so see you later, Rintarou." "No way…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the girl was taken from him, Rintarou grew pale as he stared at Keiki. If only he gave up then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Not fair." "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not fair, Kei-kun-senpai! I also… I also want my arm to be surrounded by Mizuha-senpai's breasts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are the worst…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There are things you shouldn't say out loud. If Airi had been present, she'd give him a death glare and say something like 'This is why men are the worst.' Luckily she wasn't present.</p>
<p class="null-p">They left the school behind them and walked down the crimson-orange street. Mizuha spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for saving me. I didn't know what to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't hand over my cute little sister to some pervert like that." "Yeah, he was just looking at my breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it's not like Keiki didn't understand Rintarou's feelings. Keiki had to respect his tastes as the unparalleled breasts sommelier. Yuika had small and cute bumps, Sayuki offered endless volume, Ayano's had a great shape, and there wasn't too much, and Mao's had the best balance. They all had their own attributes that made them great, but Mizuha's hidden size was the best of all. When wearing clothes, she didn't offer much, but once she took off her clothes, the difference was visible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Tokihara-senpai's exam was today, right? I wonder if she's going to be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably. She's pretty clever, even if she doesn't look like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She hasn't been to school in a while, so it really feels like exam season." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you lonely without Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, of course. She's the moodmaker for the club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a lot of calm girls in the calligraphy club, isn't there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was always working, Yuika was an indoor type, and the Kiryuu siblings always had their own things to work on. In that sense, Sayuki was the most cheerful person in the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've gotta work hard as the next club president, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I don't show some results, the club might even be abolished. Worst-case, we might not get any new members, so I'll need to practice my calligraphy."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was easy to forget now that Sayuki was gone, but Keiki and the girls were still part of the calligraphy club. It wasn't part of their agenda to draw BL manga, draw picture books that shouldn't be read by children, or research suggestive panty-flashing scenes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll take care of that problem eventually."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. For now, we only have to worry about today's dinner." "That sure sounds like a difficult problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something you'd like to eat?" "I'll think about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">While they were having this conversation, they reached a red light. While</p>
<p class="null-p">they were waiting, Mizuha breathed some warm air on her cold hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…" When she realized that Keiki was watching, she let out an embarrassed laugh. "Ahaha, it's really cold today. I should have brought some gloves."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It really was cold today. Mizuha's hands were red. "Mizuha, how about you lend me your hand?" "Eh, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay…" She reluctantly offered Keiki her left hand. Keiki grabbed it with his right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a lot warmer, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… the people around us are looking…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The traffic light had turned green in the meantime, and the people passing by gave them suspicious glances. It might be weird for siblings to hold hands while in high school. And even if the people around them didn't know about their relationship, it would probably still be uncomfortable for her. That was</p>
<p class="null-p">most likely why she had continued to hide her feelings for Keiki all this time. That being said, since Keiki wanted to become lovers, he couldn't cave when faced with an obstacle as minor as this one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to hold hands, Mizuha." "Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's eyes opened wide. After a bit of hesitation, she gave a troubled smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped, then."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_14.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">With this, the cloud covering her heart seemed to be brushed away momentarily. Now that Keiki had received permission, the two of them started walking across the pedestrian crossing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Mizuha. I think hot pot might be nice for dinner." "Okay, I'll do that then."</p>
<p class="null-p">They started talking about what to put into the hot pot, what ingredients</p>
<p class="null-p">would be the best, and which one would be the cheapest. While they made their way home, some people gave them several curious gazes, but not once did they let go of their hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since that day, Mizuha had been in a great mood. She put a lot of meat in the hot pot. She would let Keiki watch the TV show he wanted to see.</p>
<p class="null-p">After his shower, she would give him a lap pillow and clean his ears. However, the influence of her good mood reached even outside the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A heart mark…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki opened up the lid of his lunch boy during lunch break, he was greeted by a heart mark drawn on the rice. Shouma took a peek at it and grinned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are loved, Keiki." "Thanks to a certain someone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you look at that, it seems like Mizuha-chan is in a great mood. Has there been some progress or anything like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. We held hands only yesterday." "Eh, only that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if we're close, we're still siblings. We normally wouldn't do anything like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see. That explains why she's so above the clouds."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, they had been doing some fairly dangerous flirting inside the house. Keiki preferred to keep quiet about the ear cleaning for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanna invite Mizuha out on a date, but what do you think I should do?" "Just do it normally?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. But there's a lot of ways to do it, right? Is there some kind of surefire technique or anything like that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-No, there isn't anything convenient like that. Just invite her out." "Woah!? Nanjou!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou suddenly spoke from behind Keiki. Yuika and Mao had been as</p>
<p class="null-p">stealthy as assassins lately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? A heart mark on your lunch… It seems like it's going well." "W-Well, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what? You wanna invite her out on a date?" "So you were listening…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you were talking inside the class… Though I don't think anybody but me really listened in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you eavesdrop on us…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Who cares about that!" Mao averted her face in anger. Shouma was desperately trying to hold back his laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akiyama said this already, but inviting her out normally is your best option, right? Why try some other risky strategy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I don't want to fail… And inviting her on a date is super embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you, a maiden in love? Don't chicken out like that, Kiryuu." "Don't call me chicken."</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, Keiki was aware of it. He didn't want to talk about it for that precise reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I have an idea for you, Chicken." "Again, don't call me a chicken."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a great way to nonchalantly invite a girl out on date. Wanna know</p>
<p class="null-p">what it is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there really a convenient method like that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure there is, but I don't have any reason to assist you with your love life, now do I?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was absolutely true. Keiki couldn't ask for help from the girl he had rejected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't mind telling you. Buuut there's going to be one condition." "…What is your condition?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want a picture of you and Akiyama flirting around." "Deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait? What about my opinion?" Shouma asked. "So Nanjou, would you be so kind as to tell me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki completely ignored him. Right now, finding a method to invite a girl on a date was more important than his pride. Mao nodded in a satisfied manner, and spoke with a light tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've got a friend with a girlfriend already, so why not go on a double date? Akiyama with Master Koharu, and Kiryuu with Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">On the following Sunday, it was perfect weather for a date. Keiki and Shouma were waiting for their date partners at the plaza in front of the train station.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The last time I went on a double date with you was with Tokihara-senpai when we went bowling, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then I was helping Koharu-senpai, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know it's not that big of a favor, but today, Koharu-chan and I will be your assistants."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks a bunch."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the double-date idea, inviting Mizuha out had been much easier. After all, he didn't even need to use the word 'date'. Instead, he merely had to say 'How about we go have some fun with Shouma and Koharu-senpai?', and that did the deal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai knows that I have feelings for Mizuha, right?" "I did tell her beforehand, yeah. Is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it's not something worth hiding."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu was someone who had assisted Keiki greatly in his search for Cinderella. He often asked her for advice, so having her on his side was reassuring.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, why are boys and girls grouping up seperately?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan is taking care of Mizuha-chan's clothes coordination it seems." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you can be excited today. Koharu-chan has great clothing sense." "Now you've gotten my hopes up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha already had great style, and always wore stylish clothes, but the results must be even better if Koharu's own sense were added to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Guess I don't have to worry about Mizuha coming with no panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Knowing this, Keiki didn't have to be super sensitive about Mizuha's skirt situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it seems like today's main actor has arrived."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki raised his head when Shouma said that, and spotted two girls walking towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for waiting." One of them was a small girl with stylish hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu was wearing cargo pants with a hoodie, keeping up a rather boyish look as she gave a greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-We're here…" Mizuha made an embarrassed smile as she glanced over at her brother. "How… is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The blouse she wore had frills on it, and she was wearing a sweater dress with a cardigan on top.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I think you look very cute…" Keiki was so entranced by her looks that he ended up using polite speech.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she always wore adult-like and charming clothes, seeing her with a cute style like this felt fresh. It made her look younger, which was completely different from her usual atmosphere, and it made Keiki's heart race.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that cute clothes like these might be a great change for Mizuha- san, which is why I chose these."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a genius, Koharu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was so baffled from this heavenly coordination that he subconsciously found himself rubbing Koharu on the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe, how embarrassing. But Shouma-kun will get jealous, so keep the head pats to a moderate amount, please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll give you all the rubs later, so I don't mind." Shouma smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're both not fair, I want to rub Senpai's head too." Mizuha complained. "W-Why are you all so eager to rub my head?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Senpai is small and cute. The three of them got to rub the legal loli's head a lot, and-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since everyone is here, why don't we get going now?" With Shouma's signal, the party started moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">The four used trains and buses to get to the amusement park. It was the same amusement park Keiki had visited with Sayuki when he was still searching for Cinderella. He had chosen this place because Koharu had tickets, since she was the rich heiress of a company president that had ties to the place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's been a long time since I came to the amusement park." "Right. Well, let's enjoy this day as much as we can!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha and Shouma were talking to each other as they looked through the pamphlet. Behind them stood Keiki, quietly talking to Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about today. For dragging you into this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I finished all my exams, so I'm happy you invited me." She smiled</p>
<p class="null-p">and turned her gaze towards Mizuha. "So you liked Mizuha-san after all." "I only realized it a little while ago, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san is a wonderful person, so I can understand how you fell in love with her. When Shouma-kun and I were in a fight, she was trying hard to get us back together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shouma had stared too hard at an actual grade school girl, Koharu had taken that hard, which was why things ended up awkward between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, Mizuha attempted everything she could to get them to make up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both Kiryuu-kun and Mizuha-san are precious friends of mine. That's why I want you to be happy as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if they weren't blood-related, they were still siblings. This emotion Keiki felt towards Mizuha was definitely not normal. Even so, there are people who support them. Just the thought of that made Keiki's chest fill with a warm feeling. He had to work hard today so he didn't disappoint them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what should we ride first?" Right as they finished their secret talk, Shouma spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there anything you'd like to try, Mizuha?" Keiki asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine with anything. What about you, Ootori-senpai?" Mizuha looked over at Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why don't we start with a rollercoaster?" Koharu suggested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine with that, but are you tall enough to reach the minimum height, Koharu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not that small!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as she said, they had no problems getting inside, and after lining up for a few minutes, their turn arrived. Unlike before, a cold wind blew Keiki in the face, but since he got to enjoy Mizuha's face next to him, it wasn't that bad after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was fun, wasn't it, Mizuha-san?" "Yes, that was amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">It appears that both Koharu and Mizuha had taken a liking to this attraction. They were talking gleefully about it. The boys were watching from a distance, grinning at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Shouma-kun, they have a bronze statue of the mascot over there!" "Yeah, let's go check it out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, should we go as well?" "Sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">The four of them enjoyed the amusement park as a group. They played in the shooting galleries, watched a play with the mascot, and took a lot of pictures together. They even made Koharu sit on the merry-go-round horse alone and watched her like she was their child, taking pictures of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, did they always have a haunted house here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit after noon, Keiki spotted a building that looked like an abandoned hospital.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems to have been built just recently." "Huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma gave a brief explanation with the aid of the pamphlet, but since it looked awfully run-down, it didn't give off that feeling at all. Indeed, it looked like a haunted house where something could jump at you around every corner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sure gives off eerie vibes." "You can say that again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why don't we try it out?" Koharu glanced at Keiki as she said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Translated, that meant 'This is your chance to show how manly you are!'. "Mizuha, aren't you bad with this sort of stuff?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not too comfortable with it, but I'd like to try it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The last time you said that before a horror movie, you couldn't get to sleep all night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I can do it today." "Well, if you say so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that that was decided, the group decided to challenge the haunted house. Since this attraction was meant for people to go in pairs, Shouma and Koharu entered ahead, and after a bit of waiting, Keiki and Mizuha followed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This sure looks realistic…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think the backstory is that the nurses and doctors overworked themselves and died in the process, which caused them to turn into ghosts."</p>
<p class="null-p">The setting itself was pretty scary already, but the attention to detail in this hospital made it seem even more realistic. The paint on the walls had worn off and was dropping down to the floor, there were creepy dolls sitting at the reception desk, the waiting room had an eerie atmosphere, and a sense of fear was instilled in you just from walking down the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly, this is pretty bad. I feel like something will jump out at me at any second…</p>
<p class="null-p">The haunted house at the culture festival was already terrifying, but it couldn't hold a candle to the work of a professional. Keiki already felt like</p>
<p class="null-p">crying, and not a single ghost had appeared as of yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…" Unable to bear with the atmosphere, Mizuha clung to Keiki's arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she started talking, like she hated the silence. "Nii-san, something is weird…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? W-What is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel something windy touching my legs…" "Huh…?" Keiki subconsciously stopped in his tracks.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought she was just trying to tease him, but when he looked at her pale face, she apparently wasn't joking around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Almost like something invisible is inside my skirt. There's a cold hand touching my skin…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Does that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I realized why that is…" "…W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded like the problem was with Mizuha herself, rather than the environment. And after a short silence, Mizuha explained what this cruel reality was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not wearing any panties today." "…What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had expected something else, but that was still more terrifying than anything he could have come up with. Confronted with this sudden revelation, Keiki felt his blood freeze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why? Why are you not wearing any panties?" "Because I completely forgot to wear them, thehe~" "'Tehe,' my ass!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had let down his guard. He expected that only a pervert like Sayuki would attend an amusement park without wearing panties. The scariest creature in this haunted house wasn't a ghost, but Mizuha herself. Just by seeing her skirt flutter with a faint breeze, Keiki's heart was about to leap out of his chest. And that wasn't the only problem, as the first blood-drenched nurse appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cuuuuuurse youuuuuuu…" "Kyaaaaa!? A ghoooooost!?" "Mizuha!! Your skirt, your skiiiiirt!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then the true horror began, and not in a way that Keiki anticipated. Keiki</p>
<p class="null-p">was so focused on Mizuha's skirt that the rest of the environment didn't even enter his mind. Every time Mizuha got scared by a ghost, Keiki would start shrieking for a completely different reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">Later, they found themselves at the fountain plaza inside the amusement park. Keiki sat on a bench, watching the people passing by, and Mizuha came running towards him from the haunted house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for waiting, Nii-san." "Are you wearing them now?" "Yep! Wanna check?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll pass, so don't even put your hands on your skirt."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl reluctantly removed her hands from her skirt. After they safely made it through the haunted house, Keiki pressed Mizuha to put on panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, she had a pair with her, so she quickly walked off to put them on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now Keiki didn't have to worry about her fluttering skirt anymore. "Where's Shouma-kun and Ootori-senpai?" She asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They went to get us seats at the food court."</p>
<p class="null-p">Said food court was a little ways away from them. Naturally, he couldn't tell the two of them about Mizuha not wearing panties, so he gave them a vague reason and asked them to go ahead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, why didn't you wear any panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I listened to your request, so I held back from going outside without wearing any."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just figured that going no-panties is basic exhibitionist etiquette." "What kind of professional consciousness is that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…And there was also my desire of wanting to be stopped right beforehand." "Huh, what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's all your fault, Nii-san." Mizuha didn't clarify any further than that, she just stuck out her tongue in a cute way. "We've gotta hurry or we'll make the others wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Right."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Mizuha wanted to say something, but Keiki didn't want Shouma and Koharu to wait, so he gave up. For now, he figured they should just group up and have lunch. With this in mind, Keiki stood up from the bench. At the same time, a young kid was running past them. She slipped past Keiki, and right as she passed Mizuha, her churros got stuck on Mizuha's skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time it's churros, huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">Last time, a magical girl wand got stuck in Sayuki's skirt. It made Keiki feel like he was experiencing deja-vu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hya!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he realized what he was doing, his body moved on reflex. Right before the skirt was lifted high enough to reveal the clothes beneath, Keiki clung to her and pushed the fabric downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">I made it just in time…</p>
<p class="null-p">He somehow managed to avoid the worst-case scenario. Even more curious gazes were directed towards them now compared to the other day when they made their way home together, but that was totally worth protecting the girl's honor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nii-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing his little sister's baffled voice, Keiki let go of Mizuha. "I was worried about your skirt, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah… Thanks, Nii-san." Mizuha thanked him with a smile, but the awkward atmosphere didn't vanish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Were her cheeks red because he suddenly gave her a hug? Something similar had happened before when she went to school with no panties. Because of a breeze, her skirt was almost lifted up, which was why Keiki hugged her to press it down. However, back then, his desire to protect her dignity as an older brother was the biggest reason. Now, he felt jealousy towards anyone who might happen to see Mizuha's panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how much do I like this girl…?</p>
<p class="null-p">He had embraced the girl because of such simple motives. It was a fresh feeling for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"So we'll be going off on our own now, Kiryuu-kun." "I pray for your success."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, thanks, you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">Roughly 5pm in the evening, Keiki walked out of the souvenir shop as he spoke to Shouma and Koharu. All that was left for the day was to confess to Mizuha, so Keiki had to man up and do it himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, thanks for waiting… Wait, where did Shouma-kun and Ootori- senpai go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, they'll be going somewhere else away from us." "They will?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since they're here already, they wanted to spend the final few moments with just the two of them, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah, that makes sense." Mizuha nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to them going out, Keiki had a convenient excuse to be alone with Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are considerate, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that his evaluation had gone up in the process. He felt a bit guilty since it was all so that Keiki and Mizuha could be alone together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what should we do? We should be able to ride one more thing." "It has to be that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That?" Mizuha tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place they made their way to was the number-one hot spot for confessions: A giant Ferris Wheel. Mizuha's eyes lit up when she looked up at the giant structure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's even bigger up close."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you come to the amusement park, you can't miss out on this one, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They each made their own comments and took their place in line. Several bad memories came rushing back into Keiki's mind, mainly because of the last time he came here with a black-haired senior, but things should be fine this time around.</p>
<p class="null-p">After waiting for a brief moment, the two were allowed on the gondola. Of course, they naturally ended up facing each other. After checking on all the safety procedures, the employee gave the green light and closed the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">With new customers inside, the Ferris Wheel started moving. "Ah, the setting sun is beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The further up they went, the easier they could see over the town, which was colored by the setting sun. This could quite possibly be the most romantic situation possible. It was the perfect chance to confess, but now another problem arose.</p>
<p class="null-p">This isn't good. I'm getting seriously nervous all of a sudden…</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart was racing like crazy. When he thought about it, that would be his first confession in his entire life. Being alone in this secluded space with the girl he was interested in, was already way too much to handle for a beginner in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that Mizuha is crazy cute…</p>
<p class="null-p">He always thought that she was cute. As of late, he thought she looked even more beautiful, as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">No… It's because I've realized my own feelings. That's why I think she looks so cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">They say that the one who falls in love first loses. Now that Keiki had become aware of these feelings, this love grew unconditionally, and all he could think about was her. His heart would race just from being together with her like this, and even the words 'I love you' started to have a different meaning than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, staying silent was not an option. If he didn't hurry up, the gondola would reach the ground again. Trying to calm his nerves, he looked outside the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it's Shouma and Koharu-senpai." "Eh, where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think you can see them from where you are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll come over there." Mizuha got up and moved next to Keiki, looking outside the glass. "Ah, you're right. They're holding hands."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a lovers' handhold from a great height difference. However, Keiki was completely focused on Mizuha's face. Suddenly, the gondola shook a bit from the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, careful…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha fell towards Keiki. As a result, he caught her slender body with his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm sorry…" "No, it's fine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, it felt like weird magic had been cast on their bodies. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The gondola reached its peak, and Keiki held Mizuha's body in his arms, at a distance close enough for them to kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…" Mizuha slowly closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like she was giving him the signal to kiss her. As previously mentioned, in such a romantic situation, if they were to exchange a kiss, and he confessed, it would surely be a great memory for both of them. However, with the greatest possible chance in front of Keiki, another problem arose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, Mizuha." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I'm getting motion sickness…" "Nii-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was clearly his nerves, as well as the shaking gondola. Once the</p>
<p class="null-p">gondola reached its peak, it shook quite a bit. Because of this, Keiki's greatest chance to confess ended in failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki managed to avoid emptying his stomach, but because of his worsened condition, the two of them had to head home right after the gondola reached the ground. Right now, Keiki was lying on the sofa inside the living room, with Mizuha giving him a lap pillow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry that I'm such a useless Onii-chan…" "It can't be helped. How are you feeling?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll make up for it, for sure… And by the way, why are you giving me a lap</p>
<p class="null-p">pillow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to recover as quickly as possible, so I thought a lap pillow from a high school girl would be the most effective treatment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds like something an old man would think." "So how does it feel?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The sensation of your thighs is the best. Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, you should have just been honest from the start." Mizuha smiled happily as she caressed Keiki's head. "This lap pillow is thanks for helping me this afternoon. A lot of people could have almost seen my panties after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad I made it in time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's Nii-san, I don't mind showing them to you whenever you want." "O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't know how to respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wanna look at my panties now? Maybe it'll make you feel better." "Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a boy, so I thought that maybe looking at some panties would give you energy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, it'd give me energy in a different way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you prefer, I can just lift up my skirt right now, and you can bury your face in them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a bit too high of a hurdle!" Keiki said, and yet he didn't move his head away from Mizuha's thighs."</p>
<p class="null-p">His head stayed selfishly the way it was. "…Hey, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for today. I had a lot of fun with Shouma-kun and Ootori-senpai." "I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was glad to hear that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, there's something I'd like to tell you, Nii-san." "Huh? Where did that come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've been spoiling me way too much recently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've been way too kind to me as of late. You save me from Mitani-kun's flirting attempts, we hold hands on the way home from school, and you don't even get angry when I sleep in your bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I still tell you to quit sleeping in my bed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There's way too many problems with a girl his age sleeping in his bed. "Even today, you helped with my skirt…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That did get us a lot of attention though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As a little sister, I'm happy to have such a brocon Nii-san who is so kind to me, and as a brocon, that makes it even better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you should keep it within acceptable limits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Acceptable limits?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If not, something terrible will happen." "Something terrible…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something irreversible." "Just what have I started…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it a sin to spoil his little sister? If anything, being a siscon was still legally allowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're not careful, and if you're even kinder to me, then I will fall in love with you even more, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…" Keiki looked up at his little sister's face. Their eyes met, and Mizuha made an embarrassed grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had planned to confess, and yet she confessed to me again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl Keiki had feelings for was way too cute. His face started to burn up. She was so lovable, it was hard not hugging her right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I just confess now? …No, it would feel like I just used Mizuha's confession…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hesitated. Confessing while receiving a lap pillow sounded pretty lame. While he was contemplating what to do, Keiki's smartphone on the desk vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, an email?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He raised his body and checked the new message. "Who is it from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai. She sent me the pictures from today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Show me!" Mizuha brought her shoulder closer and took a peek at the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki's heart skipped a beat, but he managed to stay calm as he checked the pictures.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you've got ketchup on your nose in that one, Nii-san." "You have crepe on your mouth in that one, Mizuha." "Fufu, we're both like children."</p>
<p class="null-p">While they checked the pictures, they talked about their day at the</p>
<p class="null-p">amusement park. Using a single phone, they both looked at the pictures. "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it really okay for Keiki to be this happy? The girl he loved was right next to him. He had her smile all to himself, and nobody else knew about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, I see…</p>
<p class="null-p">Although a bit belated, he finally realized.</p>
<p class="null-p">I love spending time with Mizuha like this…</p>
<p class="null-p">He finally understood what Shouma was talking about. Once you spend time with someone, and enjoy this time more than anything, you realize that you've fallen in love. For Keiki, this person just so happened to be his non- blood-related little sister. His heart had been stolen by her voice and her gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to do all sorts of things with Mizuha…</p>
<p class="null-p">Visit all sorts of places, experience all sorts of situations, fall in love with her even more. Everything you'd do with a lover, he wanted to experience with her. Humans all turn greedy when they fall in love. Keiki had been very happy so far, and yet he still wanted even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Mizuha?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should we go somewhere again next week?" "Sure. With everyone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I want it to be just the two of us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Would that be…" Mizuha looked up at Keiki in shock. "A… date?" "Yeah. I want to go on a date with you, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki stated his honest feelings, Mizuha- "Yes, definitely."</p>
<p class="null-p">She showed a beaming smile and accepted the invitation.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">"Date~ Date~ A date with Nii-san~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The following Monday, Mizuha finished her after-classes cleaning duty and made her way home, walking down the hallway with light footsteps. Of course, there was only one reason why she was so delighted. The prior Sunday, she made a promise with her brother to go on a date.</p>
<p class="null-p">They hadn't gone on a date since summer break last year, and this time her older brother was the one who invited her, so nobody could blame the humming that came out of her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A date with Nii-san. I can't wait…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Where would they go? The amusement park was fun already, but there were lots of other things Mizuha wanted to do with just the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe I should buy some new cute underwear…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a date with a boy she got along well with. You couldn't be prepared enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can… get my hopes up, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">The other person was practically a vegetarian when it came to assertiveness towards girls, but even he might be trying to do something now that he had invited her.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, I think that Nii-san might actually…</p>
<p class="null-p">The atmosphere between the two had been progressing in that direction. Since you're always together, you notice the changes in the other person, no</p>
<p class="null-p">matter how small they are. Mizuha was slowly realizing that Keiki's feelings were directed at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I'm so looking forward to it…" A smile appeared on her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened right when she was thinking about which underwear to get. "-Hey, did you hear about Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">…Kiryuu?</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha heard a name she couldn't ignore and stopped in her tracks. There should only be one person in this school who would be referred to with that name. She hid by a wall and listened in on the conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't that a girl from Nii-san's class?</p>
<p class="null-p">They were two girls, both of whom belonged to the popular group of girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been thinking. Aren't they a bit too close despite being siblings?" The girl with longer hair spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, they were holding hands when they went home, right?" The girl with short hair and piercings commented.</p>
<p class="null-p">So they saw us back then…</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had always been careful so that rumours like these wouldn't start spreading. But she was so happy with what her brother did that she completely forgot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And yesterday, some peeps who went to the amusement park saw them." "What'd they see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu and his little sister were hugging each other at the park." "Woah, seriously? Yikes."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was when Keiki had pushed down Mizuha's skirt. Apparently, there were other onlookers as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But wait a second?" The short-haired girl spoke up. "Wasn't there talk about them not actually being blood-related?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if that's true, they've kept living together as family, right? Isn't it a bit disgusting to suddenly look at each other in that way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, right… I have a big brother myself, and even if we weren't blood related, I wouldn't be able to see him as a man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? You can't just have romantic feelings for your family."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's aiming for his little sister… Maybe that Kiryuu is actually just a pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">………</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing this conversation, Mizuha's heart froze cold. She had known that romantic feelings between siblings weren't normal. However, she never really understood what that meant. If it was just a problem for Mizuha alone, that would have been fine. Her feelings wouldn't change just because someone thought badly of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I can't drag Nii-san down with me…</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't want her brother to suffer because of her selfish feelings. Even if he was fine with that, Mizuha herself couldn't accept it. In the event that they started dating for real, and that fact would be made public, these rumours would not stop. Mizuha was forced to realize that bringing this love to fruition was more difficult than she previously assumed.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_12_15.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Just what was I getting excited for…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to move from that place, she just clutched her hand to her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The following Tuesday, after school, Keiki sent Mizuha an email as he sat inside the empty classroom. He kept it a simple 'Could you come to the classroom?' Shortly after, he received a brief 'Wait a bit'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Today was the day for revenge. He couldn't confess at the Ferris Wheel before, but today he was feeling great. He had prepared his confession and replayed it many times inside his head. Since Mizuha didn't come to his room the previous night, he had all the time he needed to practice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All that's left is for me to confess my feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">With all the things that happened lately, Keiki reconfirmed his feelings. Holding hands, eating her lunch box with the heart on it, all of that delighted him beyond anything he ever felt. Even this jealousy was something new for him. It didn't matter if the other person was his own little sister. No matter what, his feelings wouldn't change. That was why there was no need to wait until the next date.</p>
<p class="null-p">Starting today, they would be bound together in an official relationship, and work from there. That's what Keiki decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for the wait, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl in question showed up to the classroom. She must have left her bag in her own classroom, as she entered the room without baggage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why'd you call me here?" She asked with her usual tone. "I need to talk with you about something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?" Mizuha gently tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">From here on out, Keiki would confess to that girl. When he thought about it, his legs started to quiver gently, and fear filled his head. Everybody would feel restless before confessing. However, this was something Keiki desperately wanted, so he needed to overcome that. That's why Keiki took a step forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, I like you." "Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've always wanted to tell you. I can't see you as a little sister any longer. I love you as a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he said the words 'I like you', there was no stopping his momentum, and all the feelings he kept bottled inside of him came out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ever since I found out that you were Cinderella, I started to grow more and more conscious of you, until I eventually followed you with my eyes everywhere…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a little while ago, I was satisfied with our current relationship. Even without acting like lovers, I was happy just to be together, and I didn't want to rush things."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were his honest feelings. The distance between the two was just perfect.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But my feelings grew stronger by the day, and I'm not satisfied with that anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just by sitting next to Mizuha, he wanted to hug her, to kiss her. But he needed to do something before he was allowed to do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to know even more about you, Mizuha. I want us to reach a new relationship and become even closer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why-" Keiki said it to his most beloved girl. "Please go out with me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He said everything he wanted, and all he could do was wait for the girl's response. However, since he was aware of Mizuha's feelings, she would definitely accept, which meant that they could start a proper relationship-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I can't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Mizuha's response left Keiki baffled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if we're not related by blood, we're still siblings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha ignored Keiki's confusion, gently closed her eyes, and brought her harsh decision down upon him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-That's why we can't become lovers."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">*This afterword will contain spoilers for the main series, so be warned.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you very much for buying 'Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?'. After last time with Sayuki, we now have Nanjou on the cover. Honestly, it's hard to put into words on how cute Nanjou is. She's keeping up her tsundere expression, and those red cheeks are relentless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't you agree?</p>
<p class="null-p">You know, I always wanted to receive chocolate from a tsundere girl making a 'Mm…' face like that. That being said, I did actually receive chocolate from a girl before. Indeed, it was my grandmother, who gave me Bour*on biscuits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving that aside, I'd like to continue with a proper afterword. My personal favorite scene in this volume was probably Yuika-chan trying to make her breasts grow. I put it right in the beginning to immediately start a familiar feeling for the novel, but it sure was lewd, wasn't it? Truly wonderful.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to her bombshell, the various heroines of the calligraphy club started gunning for Keiki even more aggressively, and after that event with Valentine's, we finally found out who the winner of our protagonist's heart is. We have our Cinderella who dropped her panties, and the Prince who found her. Even though they should have been happy, another wall appeared between the two of them at the very last moment. I would be delighted to have you around for a bit longer so you can watch how their story ends.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, I'd like to announce that the HenSuki comicalization's final volume six will release on the 9th of February, so those of you who are interested, please check it out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, I hope we will see each other in the 13th volume.</p>
