<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">On the night of March 4th, after returning from the hot spring, in the Kiryuu Family's living room, Keiki and Mizuha sat at the dining table, facing their parents who had come home after a long time. Across the table from Keiki's seat sat a middle-aged man with average stature and muscles, wearing a polo shirt with long sleeves-Kiryuu Makoto. Next to him sat their mother Touko, who was wearing a casual shirt with pants, her semi-long glossy hair hanging down her shoulders. Upon returning home, the two took off their coats, and while Keiki and Mizuha fixed their disarranged clothes, prepared some tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is so awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt an uncomfortable bead of sweat run down his forehead amidst this oppressive atmosphere. He felt like the defendant in a courtroom, waiting for his guilty verdict to be pronounced upon him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right as I got into a good mood with Mizuha, they had to come home…</p>
<p class="null-p">Shaken by Mizuha's approach, Keiki lost against his feelings and pushed down Mizuha in this very room. That's when the tragedy happened. As they both laid on the sofa, kissing each other, he grabbed for her chest and their parents came home and saw it. The sight of that battlefield is what created this current situation. Mizuha sitting next to him, wearing her sweater from before, equally seemed like she was feeling awkward, as her face was downcast.</p>
<p class="null-p">I never would have imagined there would be a family meeting because of an incident like this. Keiki thought to himself. His father put down the teacup and opened his mouth with a humble expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, what should I say about this…? I'd like my first grandchild to be a</p>
<p class="null-p">girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're jumping the gun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet, after her husband stepped on the gas pedal with no brakes, now the housewife continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We could hold the marriage ceremony in a more western style? In front of a shrine is nice and all, but I'd love to see Mizuha-chan in a wedding dress!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold your horses, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew this, but his parents went at their own pace as always. Naturally, Keiki also wanted to see her in a wedding dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, now. Don't be like that. We do feel bad for interrupting your fun like that." Makoto argued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phrasing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you'd like, we could always spend some time outside the house?" Their father continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Great idea, Darling." "Don't support her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki just wanted to forget about all of this and vanish from this cruel world. Even Mizuha was still blushing brightly, her face downcast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to be this embarrassed, you know? Wanting to touch the person you like is something completely normal." Touko argued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right…" Keiki still felt awkward. "What's that reaction for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I was prepared for a lecture, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've accepted the fact that you two are dating, so we wouldn't comment on every small thing. Seeing how serious you are, we won't get in your way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mom…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though maybe don't do it in the living room? You'll never know when we might come home to interrupt you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… we'll be careful about from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">Touko brought flawless logic to the table, so Keiki could only nod. Next time, even if such a mood came up, he would consider time and place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, there is something your father and I are even more curious about…" Touko said, and glanced at Mizuha. "That ring on your finger. Is that an engagement ring?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? Engagement ring?" His wife's words caught Makoto's attention, and he leaned forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha put her hands together in front of her chest, showing off the ring. "Yep. Nii-san gave it to me on my birthday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Going with a ring immediately? Not bad. I'm seeing you in a new light now, Keiki-chan! Don't you agree, Darling?" Touko turned towards Makoto.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. I still remember how you were bawling your eyes out after wetting your bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How far back are you going…?" Keiki really didn't appreciate stories from all the way back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My son." "What now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is just my earnest question, but when have you two gotten so close? You sure didn't seem that way the last time I saw you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That, well… a lot happened this past year."</p>
<p class="null-p">Such as that whole Cinderella mystery, for example. Or how she stole his first kiss at the pool. And you can't forget the time she assaulted him naked during the calligraphy club's summer camp. Many more events could be named here, but these are better left a secret, as none of these episodes were anything their parents would need to know, and they didn't even know about Mizuha's exhibitionistic fetish. Thus, Keiki simply played it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about you two, anyway? Why did you suddenly come home without even telling us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's… it'll be a longer story." "Huh? Is it that important of a reason?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, both me and your mother happened to get a vacation at the same time, so we decided we might as well come home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That wasn't long at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was he acting like that, anyway?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you know, we thought we might as well visit our dear children."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We would have loved to make it home in time for Mizuha-chan's birthday, though." Touko said with a saddened tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know how busy you are, so I'm happy you tried, really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you made it, we weren't home yesterday. We stayed over at an inn during our trip."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stayed over at an inn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their parents tilted their heads at the same time, so Keiki explained everything. About how they got a double ticket from a senior at school which took them to a hot spring district, how they encountered the girl, and how they were forced to stay over because of the severe snowstorm. Thanks to the</p>
<p class="null-p">snowstorm clearing up today, they had made it home a few hours ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's what happened? I see. Going on a hot spring trip sounds wonderful~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a full-fledged couple now, huh? When I got the call from Keiki saying that he wanted to marry Mizuha, I was a bit dubious, to be honest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! Keiki-chan was so smooth back then! Saying stuff like 'Please give me your daughter's hand in marriage!', you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was around the time there had been weird rumors of them dating despite being siblings. He told Mizuha about said phone call, but left out the details for obvious reasons.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that true, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, yeah… I am pretty serious about you, after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so happy…" Mizuha blushed ever so slightly, as she reached for Keiki's hand, gently holding it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Met with this sweet sensation, Keiki's heart frozen by the previous tragedy now warmed up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…" "Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Holding hands, the two looked at each other, and right as they entered a mood allowing for another kiss, that atmosphere was destroyed because their parents were excitedly watching over the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Going for a kiss? In front of your parents? Ahh, so exciting!" "Phew, phew!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The audience sure is noisy tonight!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They barely started dating, so naturally they wanted to be as lovey-dovey as possible. Especially with a cute girlfriend like Mizuha, Keiki was brimming with excitement to continue where they had been previously interrupted.</p>
<p class="null-p">More honestly, their parents were in the way, and Keiki wished they would just go back to work, but saying 'Leave' to their faces was too cruel. So he decided to ask them indirectly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, how long will you be staying this time? Even if you two got some time off, you won't be able to stay long, right? I know that you both work at pitch- black companies after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since they worked at black companies, even if the pay was good, they had to work overtime a lot and even come in during their days off, so they couldn't even use much of their salary. As a result, they both had rented rooms near their respective companies and mostly went right back to work the day after they visited. Hence, Keiki innocently assumed they'd be gone the following day, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"We rarely get a chance like this, so we'll be taking it slow here for the next two to three days."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Two to three days?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As it turns out, their parents would stay much longer than he had wished for. In other words, it would take that long for him to be alone again with Mizuha…</p>
<p class="null-p">So we can't be lovey-dovey that entire time…?</p>
<p class="null-p">After all these trials, the suffering had yet to stop. The unbearably-sweet atmosphere from just now had vanished entirely, as Keiki slumped his shoulders in defeat.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1:The Sweetest Love In the World</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day after their parents had returned from their slave labor at the black company, Keiki sat in his still-empty classroom, reporting yesterday's incidents to Shouma, who was seated in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. That's a bummer." "You can say that again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the unexpected and unwanted visitors, their lovey-dovey time was put on hold. Right when he had mustered up his courage to climb the steps to adulthood with his girlfriend, all of it was ruined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, we played games together." "You're pretty close, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guess so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their parents might hardly ever be home, but they weren't on bad terms or anything. Even this morning, they had an enjoyable family breakfast. Mother and daughter got really into the cooking, dishing out meal after meal which now was making Keiki feel kinda bloated, but it was still enjoyable despite that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, I've never met your parents before, now that you mention it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're hardly ever home. Since both of their workplaces are so far away, they rent rooms near them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since when?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I started middle school. Around that time, they started showing up at home less and less."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Must have been rough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm used to it by now. And I was never lonely, thanks to Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">With both of their parents working full-time, it was just those two siblings living together in a fairly large home. Their family lifestyle might be a bit abnormal, but Keiki and Mizuha were allowed to live freely with their parents' allowance, so he was thankful to them despite it all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'm glad everything worked out with Mizuha-chan. Seems like the birthday surprise was a success."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was a bit worried when we got caught in that snowstorm, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">The day before yesterday, March 3rd, they had visited a hot spring district. Because of an out-of-season snowstorm all the trains had stopped, and they were desperately searching for an inn to stay at, but they luckily managed to find shelter at a charming place, and he succeeded in giving her the ring, so the results were satisfactory despite everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think I need to ask, but how did she react?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was so happy that I felt even more embarrassed. She's been grinning at the ring ever since."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Glad to hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, she takes it off for school, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their school regulations were fairly modern and open-minded, so she probably wouldn't be reprimanded, but an engagement ring would only cause a ruckus at school. Not to mention that there are faint remains of a particular rumor still lingering around. It wasn't serious enough to really care about it, but laying low for the time being would surely be their wisest choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder why our parents suddenly came home like that." "Because they got time off work, no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what they said, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Something didn't sit right with Keiki. They suddenly came home at a very random time, yet were unable to make it back for New Year's, so Keiki couldn't help feeling dubious about their explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, whatever."</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew how nonchalant his parents could be. Them coming home randomly now without thinking anything of it was plenty normal enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, because they're home, Mizuha and I can't have any fun at all. Remembering how clingy she was during the trip makes it hurt even more now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never thought you'd end up this infatuated with love, my dear Keiki." "It's Mizuha's fault for being so cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since Keiki came to terms with his feelings for her, they'd been growing non-stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even yesterday, Mizuha was so cute…</p>
<p class="null-p">He was reminded of the situation from the previous night. Sharing their feelings to each other on the living room sofa, kissing each other, with her expression filled with endless love. Realizing that he was the only person who could see such an expression made him feel even more excited.</p>
<p class="null-p">The way I'm pent up is just hell…</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting things on hold like that is painful in a lot of ways. To put it a lot more bluntly, Keiki was so horny it was tough to handle. Mizuha most likely felt the same way. Even on their way to school today, she awkwardly fidgeted the whole time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm dying over here, but flirting with Mizuha is not an option with our parents home.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki sadly wasn't confident enough to fully express his feelings with the possibility of his parents seeing it. He would have to wait until it was just the two of them at home again. According to them, they'd be leaving in two to three days, which would be either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but the time seemed much longer than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's Mao-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki raised his head when Shouma said that. He spotted Nanjou Mao right as she waltzed into the classroom. She was wearing a coat above her uniform, a student bag was on her shoulder, and her reddish-brown side-tail swayed left and right as she walked towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning. What are you two talking about?" "Keiki's parents came home yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like they both took a vacation together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm…? Your dad, huh?" Nanjou-san made an awfully wicked expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put one finger on her lower jaw, muttering to herself. "…Father and son action?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really don't have to have your damned BL fantasies every single time you hear about someone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki envisioned the end of the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, do you happen to have a picture of your dear father?" "Sure don't. I wouldn't show you even if I had one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tsk. I was hoping to use it for reference…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And that was the exact reason Keiki didn't want to show her. After everything he had been through, Keiki knew very well that such a request was only for her to have more BL material. As a result of this conversation, though, the hellish 'Dad x Keeki' couple remained in his head for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Mao almost got more BL material."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the way home, Keiki explained this incident to Mizuha, who let out a snicker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A picture would have been fine, no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hell no. Why would I want my BL debut with Dad?" "So you're fine if it's with Shouma-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not in the slightest. Keiki had simply given up in that regard. "I'm looking forward to Mao-chan's new release, you know?" "Oh, yeah. You read it too, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had already opened the door to this accursed new world. Starting with Sayuki, then Yuika, and now Mizuha, all girls in the calligraphy club had become fans of Minami Mao-sensei's doujinshi works.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Nii-san, why are you looking away from me like that?" "Don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt too awkward to directly look at Mizuha. Things may have calmed down compared to the previous night, but that didn't mean all the embarrassment had vanished entirely. Indeed, all of those feelings had come rushing up once more, and the lingering sensation of her breasts under his fingers made him feel all ticklish. Passion was burning inside of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're so cute that I can't look at you directly." "I don't get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not lying, though." "Well… thanks…"</p>
<p class="null-p">See? So adorable. Keiki's younger sister making a bashful reaction was too adorable. All his desires that had previously been sealed away by Mao's BL plan came welling back up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I kiss you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?!" Mizuha stopped in her tracks and her gaze shot towards Keiki. Her face was as red as a tomato.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I say something weird?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no…It was just a bit unexpected…You don't really say that sort of stuff often."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Usually it comes from me." "Ahhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back on it, the entire time that Mizuha was trying to win Keiki over, he never asked for anything himself. In fact, the one who invited him the day prior was Mizuha. The change in Keiki's feelings made this sort of change possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just like you so much, I don't think I can hold back." "Eh… Ehhh?" Mizuha fidgeted awkwardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably was a bit bewildered by this sudden expression of affection, but</p>
<p class="null-p">she immediately grinned and seemed satisfied. "So a kiss should be fine, right?" Keiki asked. "I'm happy, but we can't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha flat-out rejected him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, we're outside," Mizuha said. "That is true, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were walking down a sidewalk by the street. Lots of other people were out and about, and there were cars passing by. Kissing each other in such a public place would just be absurd, especially if somebody who knew saw them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But with our parents at home…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wanted to partake in his one chance to enjoy some lovey-dovey action at home, but their parents had gotten in the way. Even if they locked themselves up in a room, he wouldn't be surprised to find his parents eavesdropping on them. Keiki once more wished that their parents would return to work quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope they'll leave soon, to be honest." "I'm pretty happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you don't want to be lovey-dovey with me, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't start sulking now. We rarely get the chance to spend time with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not wrong, but I can't flirt with you as much as I want now." Keiki said. "I can't hug you, I can't kiss you, and even the continuation from</p>
<p class="null-p">yesterday…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The continuation from yesterday…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha must have caught on to what Keiki was implying. She blushed strongly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san is so lewd." "I won't deny that." "So you won't deny it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am quite the healthy high school boy, yes." "Sometimes you talk really weird, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">But since they're siblings, she stopped worrying about that ages ago. As their relationship progressed, Keiki had to stop holding back, and he became invincible. Rather, it was a miracle that he never felt any urges while living with a cute girl like Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But I feel the same way." "Huh? …Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Mizuha moved right next to Keiki. She stretched upwards and gently pressed her lips against Keiki's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only until our parents leave, okay? Put up with this for now." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Met with this surprise attack as strong as a thousand suns, Keiki could only look at Mizuha's bashful smile in a daze. She walked ahead, and Keiki touched his cheek.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_14_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha… that had the completely opposite effect…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like he had gotten a single slice of high-class steak after having been starved for days. Naturally, it wasn't nearly enough to satisfy Keiki, and he was now even more hungry for flirting.</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, after eating dinner, Keiki went to take a bath. Being the first person to enjoy the bath was always something exciting. Keiki wasn't as much of a clean freak as his sister, but he also didn't dislike taking baths. After taking off his clothes with some cheerful humming, he started taking a hot shower, as was his routine. He was enjoying his brief taste of happiness when-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me join you, Son."</p>
<p class="null-p">The arrival of his own father Makoto completely ruined any kind of bliss he had been indulging in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, Dad?! Why are you coming in without asking me?!" "What's the problem? We're both men."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's exactly why I don't want this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Needless to say, Keiki's father was naked. Without needing any further explanation, he was completely, utterly butt-naked. Even if they were related by blood, Keiki couldn't stand the sight of a man in his fourties showing up during his bath. However, as much as Keiki tried to protest, his father simply stood tall in front of him, not even trying to hide anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was thinking of seeing for myself how much my son has grown. A naked get-together between family members shouldn't hurt every once in a while, right? A bath would be the perfect chance for a private conversation, no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Taking a bath with my own dad at my age would be nothing short of torture…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be like that. And while we're at it, wash my back, won't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I shall wash your back instead." "Blegh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a son, Keiki seemed to have no right to deny it. He saw no other choice but to bear it, so he sat down on a bath chair (with both of them wearing towels, of course). With a sponge and an abundant amount of soap on it, Makoto started scrubbing his son's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How's this, Keiki? Does it feel good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not bad, but I would have preferred it if Mizuha washed my back instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuuuh? Are you not satisfied with your father's service?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If anything, I see no reason why I would be satisfied in the first place."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was he being forced to take a bath with his own father again? For a split second, Keiki was reminded of Mao's 'Father and son action' comment earlier today, but he did his best to banish those wicked thoughts. Thanks to her, his mind completely trended towards BL.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki." "What is it now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take care of Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?" Keiki almost turned around when he heard this, only to remember at the last second that his own father was sitting behind him practically naked, so he instead just responded orally. "What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure I said this before, but I think of her as my real daughter. But at the same time, she is still the precious daughter of your mother's friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you adopted her after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ten years ago, Mizuha lost her real parents during an accident, so Makoto and Touko took her in as foster parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When we decided to adopt her, we both swore to her parents that we would take care of her until the very end. That is why I have the duty of making sure she is happy. Originally, I hadn't planned on just letting her go off and get married."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And yet, you sure gave me permission quickly when I called you about it…" "We didn't agree to your relationship with nonchalant feelings, you know.</p>
<p class="null-p">We simply thought that we could leave her to you, since you've always cared for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that big of a deal, really. Just one thing. Take good care of her from now on. To make up for her parents' share, for our share, you'd better stay with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could tell that this father was very serious about this simply from his tone. And then a certain doubt he had came back to mind, and he voiced it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you come back just to say that?" "Ah, you noticed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, your timing of coming home was far too abrupt and random."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know I'm letting you live laissez-faire style, but I was worried after hearing about that rumor at your school."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was confused why they both got time off at the same time, but as it turns out they had probably been so adamant about taking this time off because they were concerned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it seems like I didn't have to worry in the first place. Whenever</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's with you, she looks the happiest. She's even more clingy than before, so as her father, I feel lonely…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That last half was just your selfish greed as a father speaking…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Makoto sounded like a sore loser. If Keiki turned around now, he would probably see his father making a defeated expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, that rumor has been resolved, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to your help, yeah. The fact that our parents accepted it helped a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You weren't related by blood from the very beginning, so you can be as open about it as you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'll do just that, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the student council and newspaper club, that heavy atmosphere directed towards them at school had vanished. Right now, the worst he got were blessings from his classmates along the lines of 'Explode, damn siscon'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a lucky guy, Keiki. Nowadays, it's hard to find a girl who's so devoted and skilled at housework, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm well aware."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha is pretty, kind, and popular with all the guys at school. She's good enough of a catch that she almost seems wasted on such an average guy like Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't make her cry, you hear me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. I can't even think of a life without Mizuha anymore. I won't ever make her feel lonely anymore, and I will do everything I can to make her happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki swore to always be together with her. He wouldn't let go of the hand she held, and he wouldn't let her be alone ever again. He was confident that</p>
<p class="null-p">he would not lose against anyone when it came to these feelings. "I see. That's a relief."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure seem happy, Dad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The son and daughter I treasure get to be happy, so as a parent, I couldn't be happier."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">With the sudden serious tone shift of the conversation, Keiki was unsure how to react. He felt genuinely embarrassed about this whole ordeal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm actually relieved, you know? It's not been that long since you entered high school, but since you showed no signs of ever getting a girlfriend, I was scared you'd live your life all alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Piss off, Dad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had lived his life without ever experiencing anything resembling a romance, but he had still received chocolate every single year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how did you end up getting this close with Mizuha?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not too long ago, we were on the phone and you found out that you two aren't related, and now you've ended up like this. Come on, spill the beans."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you making it sound like we're on a school trip?" "Don't be embarrassed now. I'm not leaving until you tell me." "What an awful threat that is…" Keiki felt truly annoyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Talking with his old man out of all people about the beginning of his love would be much worse torture than anything else he had previously experienced. But even so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, it's been a while since they got to spend time together, so going along like this shouldn't hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll wash your back now, Dad."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, he answered all sorts of Makoto's questions, and was forced to even listen to how his parents' love started. They talked for a long time, but never ran out of things to say. Until the very minute they left the bathroom, their conversation continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Around the time the men of the Kiryuu Family were enjoying a naked get- together, Mizuha and Touko had finished cleaning up the dishes, and were now seated around the dining table, enjoying some hot chocolate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They sure are taking their time," Mizuha said. "You're right. I'm sure they have a lot to talk about." "A lot to talk about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cute you are, how much of an angel you are, how every family needs a Mizuha-chan. That sort of stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I highly doubt that." Mizuha let out a snicker.</p>
<p class="null-p">As was evident, Toukoa was somewhat of a jokester at times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I have to say I'm surprised that you've gotten even better at cooking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's all because of you teaching me, Mom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've long passed me at this point. I feel like I need to get you to teach me now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Until Keiki and Mizuha started middle school, their parents had decided to stay with them, living together as a family. Mizuha had learned the basics of her household skills back then from her mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you like about Keiki-chan, Mizuha-chan?" "Huh? Where did that come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was watching you all day yesterday. Your 'I love you' aura has been seeping out of every core of your body, so I was just curious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of aura is that supposed to be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the truth, though. You looked like a maiden in love." "It's that obvious, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha evidently wasn't aware of the aura she was giving off. Honestly speaking, ever since they started dating, and she didn't have to hold back her feelings for him anymore, she had completely lost control.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you ask me that… How kind he is, how he spoils me all the time, and how he can work so hard for somebody else, I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? There are that many reasons, huh?" "Urk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mother grinned at her, and Mizuha felt her face growing hot. Talking to her mother about the person she liked felt different than telling a friend about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be your mother-in-law once you get married, huh?" "You're jumping the gun, Mom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're still in high school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's only true right now. Soon you'll graduate from high school, become university students, and then you'll be proper adults in no time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that how that works?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure does. You'll be a grandma before you realize it." "Grandma…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha couldn't even imagine that, or anything about the future. On the most fundamental level, Mizuha simply wanted to be together with the person she liked. Marry him, have children, and build a happy family. That must be happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's a lucky guy for receiving this much affection from such a cutie." "I wonder?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure. Keiki-chan was also giving off that lovey-dovey aura. This is the first time I've seen him so infatuated with something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He only started being conscious of me recently, though." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He forgot that we're not related by blood, after all." "Ahhh, I see…" Touko let out an awkward comment.</p>
<p class="null-p">She held the cup with both her hands, awkwardly averting her face as she confessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason Keiki-chan had the wrong idea… might actually be me." "Huh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He actually asked me about it before. Even though you were supposed to be siblings, he asked why your birthday was only five months apart. He was taught about it in class one day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, he thought that you were his genuine little sister, so I figured it would be fine to not tell him about you being adopted… In the end, I just said 'It's because I did my best to give birth to her quicker'…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why Nii-san never questioned it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Back when the identity of Cinderella had been revealed, and Mizuha brought up the contradiction in regards to their birthdays, Keiki let out a puzzling 'Isn't it because our parents worked really hard?' answer. When a parent tells you something when you're young, you end up believing it no matter how nonsensical it may be. And without having it pointed out, you don't realize how wrong it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I didn't know about your feelings back then, I guess I just got in the way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true."</p>
<p class="null-p">Touko raised her head in surprise and was greeted by Mizuha's smile. "I'm happy that you thought of me as your real daughter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, she was the foster child of the Kiryuu Family. In regards to that, they never talked much about it. That showed her parents treated her as their own child, which was why Mizuha had never had any intention of blaming Touko for it. Not to mention that Keiki's attitude most likely wouldn't have changed either way. On the contrary, his affection for her hadn't changed in the slightest even after being told that they were not related by blood. Him being this way is why she fell in love with him in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Mom?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? For what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You came home to watch over us, right? Because a lot happened at school." "Ah, you found us out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't make much sense for you to come home at such a time. Sorry that we forced you into this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A parent would always be worried about their children." "Yeah… But I'm fine now."</p>
<p class="null-p">When the rumors went around, Mizuha certainly was hurt. She felt sad, guilty, and tried to keep distance from the person she liked. However, he cleared up all of this anxiety she had felt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san was really cool, you know. He did so much when those rumors went around. Although I was a bit surprised to hear about the engagement."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how much did this save Mizuha? She turned all of these feelings inside of her chest into words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He took me out on a trip for my birthday, and he even gave me a ring as a present. I'm really, really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Happy to the point she could break out in tears any second.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I want to make Nii-san happy now. I want him to feel glad that he chose me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt bottomless gratitude to her parents. Taking her in as she was all alone, treating her like their genuine daughter. Loving her endlessly so that she didn't feel lonely. The gratitude she felt couldn't be put into words, which was why she had to put them into her actions instead. Becoming happy with Keiki was the best way to show all of that to her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've grown a lot in the short time I haven't seen you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to all of you caring for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess so. I think I don't have to worry about you anymore." Touko gave her a relieved smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">That smile resembled someone else, making Mizuha happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-chan, how about we take a bath together once those two are done?" "Sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">There were still so many more things to talk about. And Mizuha herself felt excited to decide which story to tell her mother next.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Early the following morning, when the stars had yet to even vanish from the dark sky, four people gathered at the entrance of the Kiryuu Household.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right, it's time we return to our respective battlefields." Touko sighed. "Yup, another deathmatch awaits us, tehe~" Makoto made an awkward wink. "Sorry, but that dark humor doesn't really hit home for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Met with such a depressing mood, Keiki couldn't help but make a complicated face. Just as the contents of their conversation hinted at, it was time for their parents to return to their work. As this farewell was happening in the early morning, Keiki and Mizuha were still in their pajamas. To be specific, his little sister was wearing a warm and comfy-looking one-piece. In contrast, their parents were in full battle armor, wearing coats above their suits, their shoes put on properly like soldiers heading off to war.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could have at least stayed for breakfast."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, Mizuha, but there's been some trouble at my company," Makoto said with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here. It seems like nothing really works out if I'm not there," Touko</p>
<p class="null-p">nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Make sure to get proper rest, okay?" Mizuha looked a bit anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. We got a short break now, and my Mizuha-chan energy has been recharged." Touko said, embracing her daughter one last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Makoto watched this exchange and put his hand on the doorknob. "Alright, you two, we're going."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Make sure to get along while we're not here, okay?" "Yeah, you be careful out there, Mom, Dad." Keiki smiled. "Have a safe trip."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sent off by their children, the two left the house. They walked together halfway, then split up and departed towards their respective workplaces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The storm has finally passed, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's comment just highlighted how noisy the house was with their parents home. Yet now it was unbelievably calm, and the house felt too big for just the two of them. Even so, thanks to the girl next to him, he didn't feel lonely in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now it's just the two of us again, Mizuha." "You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit early, but let's prepare for school later."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only around half past 6 am. Not exactly a time where they would have to rush, but also not early enough time for another nap. Keiki started to head back to his room, but certain circumstances didn't allow him to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">Namely, his little sister grabbed his hand in hers. "Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today… once we get home… the continuation from last time…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards the end, her voice grew weaker, but the grip on his hand became stronger. Since her intent was so clear, and she was looking at him with dampened eyes, even Keiki wasn't dense enough to miss what she was referring to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" Her face was as red as a tomato, showing her embarrassment without the need for words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's blood started to boil as he received all of this heat, and he remembered what had happened on the night of March 4th in the living room of this very house. Exchanging kisses, and the sensation of their feelings becoming one and the pleasure of doing so. Naturally, Keiki wished to continue the events of that night. Now that the nuisance of their parents was gone, and these two lovebirds were alone, they obviously were conscious of each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I guess we should prepare for school…!" "R-Right…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after they let go of each other's hands, the oppressively sweet atmosphere would not go away. While imagining their soon-to-be future, the two of them found themselves unable to look each other in the eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could not focus on the classes at all. Because of the events of the morning, no formulae nor English grammar stayed in Keiki's head for longer than two minutes. Even a single period felt like an entire day's worth of classes. It must have been really suspicious to anyone watching him, as Keiki was warned several times by the teachers during the day, earning himself a glimmer of worry from Shouma and Mao, and even Yuika was dubious about</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's behavior. Naturally, he took the day off from club activities.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, he sent Mizuha a message to meet up at the front entrance so that they could go home together. The same as they had headed to school, they barely exchanged any words now. They met eyes several times, but neither of them reacted much, and they just kept on walking. They were undoubtedly thinking about the same thing. Namely, what was about to happen the moment they got home. That thought alone filled both of them with anticipation but also uneasiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">They went home directly with no detours, and right as they entered their home, locking the door behind them, Keiki took her to his room. They threw their bags to the side, took off their coats and blazers, and pulled the curtains closed. Inside the dimly-lit room, they sat down on the bed. Keiki wanted to confirm things one last time just to make sure, but that seemed to not be needed. Looking at Mizuha's wet eyes, brimming with anticipation, Keiki found himself unable to hold back. He placed his hands on her shoulders and pressed his lips onto hers for a kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a sweet and gentle kiss, but once he set on for a second one, it became a lot more passionate. As if to replicate the events of that night, they exchanged kiss after kiss. As if to regain what they had lost that evening, as if to convey their bottomless affection, with each kiss, they began to remove a piece of each other's clothing. One layer was gone, then another, all the while they both held back their desire to just rip them off each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon enough, the floor was covered with scattered clothes, and finally the last layer of white underwear fell to the ground. Met with this overwhelmingly beautiful scene, Keiki swallowed his breath. The girl laying on the sheets in front of him was too alluring. Revealing everything she could, the girl's cheeks were red in embarrassment, which only caused Keiki to feel more aroused, causing him to reach the limit of trying to act like a gentleman.</p>
<p class="null-p">They called out each other's names, and as their bodies overlapped, everything turned hazy. After the initial awkwardness, they both longed for each other even more, until Keiki could only see the girl in his eyes. With white skin drenched in sweat, a sweet scent filling the air, hot breathing</p>
<p class="null-p">hitting his neck, a high-pitched voice moaning into his ear, all of her acted as a serum to completely dull Keiki's ability to reason. The girl he cared so deeply for accepted all of him. There was no greater joy than this feeling of being connected to the person you adore, with both body and mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Even after everything was done and their initial heat subsided, his precious feelings for her never fully cooled down.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time Keiki woke up, he was laying in his bed, facing upwards. How much time had passed since then? The faint light entering the room had already changed from the setting sun to a faint moonshine. When he turned his head sideways, he found his beloved girlfriend right next to him. She was using him as a hugging pillow, her cheek resting on his chest, her upper body relaxed. Although they were covered by the blanket, that was only true for their lower body, so Keiki could clearly see Mizuha's bare shoulders. It seemed like Mizuha had been watching her older brother for a while, because her eyes were fixated on him. And once their eyes met, they both let out a snicker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a bit embarrassing, huh?" "You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, that was… amazing." "Yeah, that it was."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though quite some time passed since the act, the aftertaste had yet to fully fade. Since this was their first experience, they were not used to it at all, and things didn't work out perfectly. In fact, Keiki wasn't sure if he even was going at the right speed for Mizuha. But there was one thing he was certain about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really happy that I got to do it with you, Mizuha." "…Yeah." Mizuha nodded and drew her body even closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki gently placed her palm on her cheek, and she happily narrowed her</p>
<p class="null-p">eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nii-san, can I ask you something?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been meaning to ask this for a while now. When the rumors went around, you kissed me at school, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, sure did."</p>
<p class="null-p">As the rumors of the two siblings dating went around, the relationship between the two of them temporarily became awkward and distant. The reason for this was that Mizuha had spotted Mao aggressively approaching Keiki in the classroom. After that, Mizuha had a misunderstanding about his relationship with Mao, and she ran off crying, which was why Keiki saw no other option to calm her down except to kiss her. It was all messy back at the time, but it seemed like Mizuha still remembered it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you kiss me back then?" "Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki reminisced for a moment. At the very end, he managed to figure out the reason behind the emotions he felt, but the reason for his actions made him hesitant to tell Mizuha, as it was awfully embarrassing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do I… really have to say it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you put it that way, it only makes me more curious." "Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally she'd be curious about the reason behind Keiki's actions as it ended in a kiss of all things. Hiding it wouldn't do him any good either way, he figured, so he went ahead and told her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you know. That kiss was born from jealousy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jealousy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, you were avoiding me because of the rumors going around at school, yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I know the reason behind it now, it doesn't matter much anymore, but back then, I was afraid. Despite avoiding me, I saw you suddenly getting along with another guy, so that made me feel jealous."</p>
<p class="null-p">There may have been different circumstances back then, but Mizuha still rejected her brother's confession and avoided him. And yet, she suddenly started getting along with Rintarou, which certainly was no laughing matter for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And yet, there was a misunderstanding between me and Nanjou, so when I saw you cry and realized that you still liked me… and because of how cute you are… I didn't want anybody else to have you, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Back at the time, Keiki's kiss was his own attempt at stopping the girl's tears. But that wasn't all of it, because he also fell in love with her even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">These two desires blended together into the act of kissing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why…" Mizuha muttered, sitting up straight on the bed, covering her face with a pillow, "I didn't expect Nii-san to be this attached… It's so embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't get what makes you feel embarrassed and what doesn't…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was totally fine showing off her panties, and yet she had such a pure side that didn't match it at all. However, the sight of his bashful little sister was too adorable for Keiki to handle. He waited for the moment Mizuha showed her face and kissed her again. It was a simple and sweet kiss with just their lips pressed against each other, but once that was done, they laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just that miniscule amount of skinship was enough to fill their hearts with joy. However, the only organ filled was the heart after all. Keiki's stomach</p>
<p class="null-p">grumbled in an attempt to inform him of his primitive instincts other than reproduction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about that…" Keiki apologized for utterly ruining the mood, blushing beet red.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Mizuha just let out another snicker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, we didn't even eat anything yet. Maybe I should make something light?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This late? Are you sure?" "Omurice would be easy." "Omurice… I can make that." "Huh? You will?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made my own food when you were staying at Koharu-senpai's place… Well, I don't think it'll be that great, so maybe you should make it after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…" Mizuha shook her head. "I'd like to eat Nii-san's omurice."</p>
<p class="null-p">As it was a request from his adorable girlfriend, Keiki naturally couldn't decline. Haste makes waste, as they say, so Keiki quickly took a shower, and headed to the kitchen, preparing the dinner while Mizuha took a bath. The menu consisted of simple omurice, chicken rice wrapped up in a half-cooked egg. In the end, Keiki wasn't totally happy with the cooking he pulled off, but after Mizuha had gotten a taste, she smiled with a gentle 'Delicious'.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, it was at least better than the one Keiki had made before. It was surely thanks to the fact that Keiki made it for the person he cherished. Now he understood why Mizuha could always put all of her heart into her cooking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Making food for the person he cared for was fun, and he felt happy that she liked it. With that in mind, he realized that in both love and cooking, your feelings for the other person were the best possible spice.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning, Keiki and Mizuha finished their preparations as always and headed to school. After putting on their indoor shoes, they were reunited again, and talked about this and that while heading up the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had planned on taking their time while walking, and yet they reached their destination all too quickly, arriving at their respective classrooms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, Nii-san, I'll see you later." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, Mizuha realized that there was something off with Keiki. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I'm not sure if I should say this, but…" "Yeah…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because we've been together all day yesterday, I just… don't want to separate here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…?" Mizuha's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki himself never expected it to turn out this way. However, after coming home from school until this very moment, they had always been together. Getting up together, eating breakfast together, going to school together… And because they were inseparable for basically the last 24 hours, the time where they couldn't be together felt even more depressing, making it harder to split up here. Naturally, Keiki felt pathetic because of it, but it was the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, what am I even saying…? We'll see each other right after classes anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come with me." "Huh? …Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha suddenly took his hand, pulling him along to a particular classroom building, more specifically to an open space. It was a small area away from the noise of the other students, and once they were in the shadows of a large pillar standing in the hallway, Mizuha let go of Keiki's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Turn around for a second." "Sure…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki did as he was told, when he heard the sound of Mizuha's bag falling to the ground, as well as faint rustling of clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder what she's up to now?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki naturally was curious, but he decided to keep quiet and wait just like that. After a few seconds passed, he heard a confident "Okay, you can turn around" from Mizuha. Receiving permission, Keiki turned around again, and faced the girl-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go."</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with these words, she offered Keiki a pair of water-blue panties. Since her actions were so natural, Keiki accepted the panties with his own two hands, and closely inspected them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, Mizuha-san… What am I looking at here?" "My panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, yeah, I figured as much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no reason to even doubt it for a second. Keiki of all people would know.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_14_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"But they still feel warm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I was wearing them up until now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You took them off here?! What if somebody saw you?!" "It's fine. Nobody's around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not the problem here."</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was in the greater scheme of things such as morals or common sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit embarrassing even for me, but I was so happy to hear how lonely you were, so this is a special service for you, Nii-san. While we can't be together, I want you to treat these panties like they were me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you telling me to keep these for the whole day?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I have to get to my classroom or I'll be late. You'd better hurry as well, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Mizuha-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stood still in awe, panties in hand, as Mizuha walked away with quick steps. After a few seconds of feeling the warmth from the panties, Keiki muttered to himself in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What am I supposed to do about this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew that this was an act of kindness from Mizuha. However, panties at school would benefit nobody. And even so, Keiki couldn't hold back a snicker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha's face was so red…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just a deduction, but maybe this entire thing was just Mizuha trying to hide her embarrassment. Because of what had happened the day prior, Mizuha might just be excited in her own way. Once again, Keiki realized that</p>
<p class="null-p">he had chosen quite the pervert as a girlfriend, but since he understood that this was her way of showing affection, he couldn't help seeing such an abnormal approach as adorable. Even her face when handing him the panties was absolutely adorable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't believe I'm grinning at my sister's panties… I'm quite the pervert myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">A brocon little sister who loves her older brother so much she gave him her panties, and a siscon older brother who tightly grasped them. They might just be the perfect match; a perverted couple. But even so, Keiki couldn't allow his little sister to go full commando at school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd better catch her later to put them back on."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was his duty as an older brother to protect his sister's dignity. While praying that nothing bad would happen with her skirt in the meantime, he stuffed the panties in his bag and headed back to his classroom.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: The Perverted Girls Started A Girls Meeting</p>
<p class="null-p">It was March 7th, an average Wednesday lunch break. As the third-years had the freedom to choose to come to school or not, the library room was devoid of any visitors while Yuika organized the returned books and put them back into the bookshelves. She picked up five hardcover novels. She put four of them into the bookshelves so that the next person could read it, and she placed the final one into the bookcase in the back of the library room, when</p>
<p class="null-p">-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From beyond that bookcase, Yuika heard voices talking, so she stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…We can't do that here… What if someone comes…?" "You told me to do this, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ahnn~ So pushy~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the contents of the conversation, Yuika immediately felt her mood drop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During the day, even…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a library committee member, you would sometimes run into people like them. Those disgusting couples would conduct reproachable acts in the shadows of the bookcases.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to give them a proper warning!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The library room was a place for reading, and definitely should not be used to flirt around like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey! What are you doing in the sacred land that is our library room?!" "Huh?! …Wait, Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika jumped out of the shadows, only to spot a familiar person. It was Kiryuu Keiki, who turned around in shock at Yuika's sudden appearance. Next to him stood Mizuha, both of these seniors conducting in a roleplay that a child should never be forced to see. Mizuha stood with her back to the bookcase, Keiki crouching down in front of her, in the middle of pulling down her panties. By the way, these panties had a pretty water-blue color.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing here?!" "Hold on, let me explain!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you need to explain while pulling down Mizuha-senpai's panties?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it! I'm not pulling them down, I'm trying to put them on her!" "That doesn't matter! Neither of those should not be done in public!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that he had his hands on a pair of panties didn't change. In Yuika's eyes, either of these explanations was a definite red card. Since Yuika was known as the angel of the library room, this was too much for her to handle, as she aggressively scolded the two while blushing furiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"So with that, Yuika would like to begin the second 'Calligraphy Girls' Meeting'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the same day after classes had ended, Yuika declared these words in the calligraphy club room. Surrounding the table sat the same four members of</p>
<p class="null-p">the previous meeting. First, the one who had called for this meeting, Yuika. Mizuha sat next to her, Mao was seated across from her, and Sayuki was next to Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The topic to discuss today is the illicit relationship between Keiki-senpai and Mizuha-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The illicit relationship between Kiryuu and Mizuha, huh?" "Isn't that interesting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Yuika's statement, both Mao and Sayuki glanced at Mizuha, who could only let out a faint laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During today's lunch break, Yuika spotted these two in an empty space in the library room. Keiki-senpai was apparently in the middle of putting Mizuha-senpai's panties on for her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu was… Wait, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, you walked in on them after the fact?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not exactly what happened…" Mizuha commented on the two previous statements made by Mao and Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why was Keiki-senpai putting on your panties for you?" "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha felt a bit embarrassed explaining what had led up to that point. However, she didn't want things to stay as a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This morning, when we walked to school, Nii-san said that he felt lonely because we had to split up for classes, so I took off my panties and gave them to him. I said that he should think of them as me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What in the world are you doing?" Yuika went pale.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, I understand where Mizuha-san's thought process came from."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both of you are crazy, Prez. Normally you wouldn't give anybody your panties…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, since when has Keiki-senpai been so head over heels for Mizuha- senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were almost blindly in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, did Kiryuu just accept your panties?" Mao asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san seemed bewildered for sure, but since I was running late, I had to leave him behind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doesn't that mean that he wanted to give them back to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika agrees." Yuika nodded after Mao's comment. "So the reason Keiki- senpai put the panties on for you was because…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Nii-san sent me a message saying 'I'm not letting you go full commando at school', so I had him put them on in the library room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's what happened…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for doing something weird in the library room."</p>
<p class="null-p">This time around, Mizuha really had to reflect on her actions. She was lucky that Yuika was the one who found them, but if it was anyone unrelated, it might have had a much worse ending.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But couldn't you have just put on the panties yourself? Why did you make Kiryuu do it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I wanted him to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, I forgot you were an exhibitionist, Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had about the same reaction as Keiki. Handing her panties to her boyfriend, and making him put them on her was weird to accept, but Mizuha was a rather extreme pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it does make sense. A virgin like Keiki-kun would never make a girl do this, let alone at school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right, cherry boy Keiki-senpai doesn't have the guts to do that sort of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure he wouldn't even lay a single finger on Mizuha." "Uhhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The topic of conversation took a rather uncomfortable turn, and Mizuha awkwardly averted her gaze. She was trying to not let this topic continue, but her reaction was a bit too unnatural, which made the girls suspicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha? Wait, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you avert your eyes like that, Mizuha-senpai?" "W-What might you be talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry to ruin your intentions, but you'll be spilling everything there is to tell us, okay, Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my…" Mizuha quickly realized her own failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she was too shaken, she was unable to give a proper response. "Mizuha-san is this flustered…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-senpai, are you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha… did you… do it with Kiryuu…?" "Ah, uh, err…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The pressure emanating from the girls was no joke. Not to mention that the three of them were leaning in towards Mizuha. Unable to bear their gazes, Mizuha stood up from her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to go shopping for tonight's dinner, so if you would-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you really think we'd let you escape with such a blatant lie?" Sayuki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've learned from our past mistakes. We even locked the door, yes." Yuika smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We won't let you go home until you 'fess up, so out with it, Mizuha." Mao joined in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, this sort of thing has happened before, hasn't it?" Mizuha sank back down into her chair, realizing that there was no escaping the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, let's get back to the main topic now that Mizuha-san is willing to tell us. How far did you go with Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you do it with Keiki-senpai?" "What is it, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… Well… we may have done it, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The second Mizuha uttered these words, the girls gasped. After all, she was cornered by these three girls who had been taken over by curiosity, and with this much passion coming from them, there was no use making up excuses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think you two already did it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, how was it? I heard that your first time hurts quite a bit." "Mmm, not that much? Nii-san was really gentle after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing about Mizuha's experience, both Sayuki and Yuika went 'Kyaaa~!' in full excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You mind if I ask about Kiryuu's size?" "Mao-senpai, that's a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… About the same size as Keeki-kun in your books, Mao-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You answered her?! Also, Keeki-kun is… pretty big, no…?" Yuika blushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I do have Nanjou-san's books with me." Sayuki took out a collection of books from virtually nowhere, opening them up. After the four of them looked through certain pages, they each raised voices ranging from 'Eeek?!' to 'Ohhh!' to 'Nooo~!' respectively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika had no idea that Keiki-senpai was this well-endowed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a shame that I can't see the real thing for myself." Sayuki narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I actually touched him before when he had a half-chub." "Huh? Mao-chan, what did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With nobody to play the straight man, these girls were going absolutely crazy. It was a genuine and raw girls' gathering that could only happen with no boys around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how did you and Keiki-kun end up getting together, Mizuha-san?" "Ah, I was curious about that myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell us, Mizuha-senpai." "That's a bit embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Mizuha-senpai, I feel like you said something even more embarrassing just now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, the fact that it was embarrassing didn't change. So she exercised her right to remain silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should we do, Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't help it. We'll have Ootori-san take over."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki took out her smartphone, quickly typing out a message. It didn't take long for Koharu to arrive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for coming. Come on, take a seat. It'll be like your birthday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, then if you would excuse me…" Koharu sat down after being invited inside. "So why did you call me here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are close with both Keiki-kun and Mizuha-san, yes? We wondered if you knew just how their relationship progressed this much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Shouldn't you just ask Mizuha-san directly about this?" "She's too embarrassed to tell us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh. I see." Koharu immediately nodded, and looked at Mizuha with a smile and a 'Must be hard' kind of look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-san, do you have anything you could tell us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know much about what happened after they began dating, but… Ah, yes, I think they went on a one-day trip the other day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"One-day trip?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With this new piece of information, the three girls became noisy once more. "B-But if they got back home the same day, it's not that big of a deal…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's right, Nanjou-san, we shouldn't panic yet." "Safe, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Mao, Sayuki and Yuika equally gave their comments. However, the story was far from being done…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we planned on going home the same day, but because of a snowstorm,</p>
<p class="null-p">all trains stopped, so Nii-san and I had to stay over at an inn." "You had to stay over?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three girls were utterly baffled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you stayed in the same room as Keiki-senpai?!" "Yeah, since they only had one open room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You mean that's when you two…?" Mao carefully asked. "Nope. Though we did take a bath together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-A bath with Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika must have imagined that scene, as she blushed once more. Despite her fetish, she was actually quite innocent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's so much information that I can't keep up…" Sayuki held her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're not done yet! In fact, Mizuha-san actually received a wonderful present from Kiryuu-kun, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah." Led by Koharu's comment, Mizuha nodded ever so slightly. "That day was my birthday, so Nii-san gave me a ring as a present. He said it was an engagement ring…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"An engagement ring?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He told me to close my eyes in that inn room, and then he put the ring on my finger."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure sounds romantic despite it being Kiryuu…" "N-Not bad, Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A ring as a birthday present. Yuika would never expect that from the indecisive Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha once again was reminded of how cool her older brother was back then, which made her smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Mizuha-san, you sure are telling us a lot despite being so against it before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, I understand how you feel, Mizuha-san. If I was this happy with the person I loved, I would want to brag about it all the time." Sayuki smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had hit the bullseye. With how fun the trip was, and how happy she felt about the ring, Mizuha subconsciously must have wanted to brag about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew… I feel so full for some reason." Sayuki sighed. "What were we even talking about before this?" Mao asked. "How Mizuha-senpai and Keiki-senpai ended up doing it." "Who cares about that now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the one who asked about it." Mao retorted Sayuki. Once the girls calmed down a bit, Mao now glanced at Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, how are things going between you and Akiyama?" "Huh? Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Yuika was curious about that as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">The blonde-haired girl was brimming with interest, and Sayuku and Mizuha looked over at Koharu with gazes of anticipation. In the end, all girls adored this kind of love talk. And now, their attention simply diverted towards their adorable senior.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…" Upon being met with all these expectations, Koharu put one finger on her cheek. "Then let me tell you about the time I visited Shouma-kun's room."</p>
<p class="null-p">During the afternoon on a certain weekend, Ootori Koharu was invited to her boyfriend's room. That day, Koharu was wearing a western sweater with a flared skirt and matching black tights, and Shouma was rocking a hoodie with jeans. The two of them sat on floor cushions at a low table, facing each other. As for what they were doing-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, this part is wrong. A bit of a careless mistake." "You're right. I'd better be careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You finished the formula mid-way, so now you just have to solve several problems to get used to them."</p>
<p class="null-p">As you can see, they were studying together with their workbooks and notes opened up on the table. Shouma called Koharu a bit before this, asking her to teach him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry that you have to look after my studies even on a weekend like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Koharu didn't have any particular plans, she didn't mind. If anything, being called to his room like this and being allowed to spend time together was more than enough of a reward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why the sudden motivation to study?" "Well, I was just… thinking…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking about what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I actually want to get into the same university as Koharu-chan." "Huh?" Koharu's eyes opened wide. She didn't expect that.</p>
<p class="null-p">The university Koharu was planning on attending was the same as Sayuki, which was a fairly difficult university to get into relatively close to their home. The entrance exams were hard, but Koharu was clever. With a lot of studying, she managed to get accepted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're like a noble lady, Koharu-chan. We may be from different classes, but I at least want to do my best with my studies, and make sure that I can stand next to you without embarrassing you and me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… my parents don't care about that, you know?" "Even so, I care."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's rare for you to be this worked-up about something." "Well, half of that is just me acting cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Acting cool? …Eek!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Koharu let out a shriek was because Shouma embraced her from behind. He made it a tight hug as if to ensure she wouldn't run away, which made Koharu blush aggressively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shouma-kun…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're just so cute, Koharu-chan…" "Huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're small, compact, and you fit perfectly into my arms…" "Doesn't… that all mean the same thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu knew that she didn't have the figure of a model, but being called small and small over and over did bother her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're just so charming, I'm worried that a lolicon at your university might set their eyes on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">That must have been the real reason why he wanted to attend the same university as Koharu. Basically, he was worried to the point it drove him crazy. Seeing him, the man who was always leading Koharu, so weak and fragile, made her heart skip a beat in joy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy you care for me this much, Shouma-kun." "Koharu-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I don't think there's any reason for you to worry. I doubt there are that many lolicons like you, Shouma-kun~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu's boyfriend made a baffled reaction. He kept Koharu in his arms, talking on and on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But there might be some perverted bastard who falls victim to your loli charm!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's nobody like that, so don't worry~" "Really?! Are you sure?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Most certainly. And even if there was, the person I like is Shouma-kun only, so there won't be any problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess you're right about that…" "Hee hee. As long as you understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Koharu couldn't see her boyfriend's face, she could tell that he still wasn't fully convinced. That, however, made him seem even cuter. Her heart was starting to go crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But attending the same university as you sounds fun." She said and turned around in his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">She moved even closer towards Shouma, putting her small hands on his cheeks, and gave him a passionate kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been chasing you all this time, so this time it's your turn to run after me, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">We return to the present, namely March 7th in the calligraphy club room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's how it happened." Koharu had finished telling her story, and all the girls gasped once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So mature and inspiring! Yuika's heart was racing the entire time!" "You're not bad, Master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You aren't just a legal loli, huh?" "Even my heart skipped a beat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, now I feel embarrassed." Koharu scratched her cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess you're the type to go all out in a relationship, Ootori-san. Attending the same university as a couple sounds wonderful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. I would be happy if I could go to the same university as Shouma-kun. Campus life with my boyfriend sounds wonderful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Boyfriend, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Must be nice, having a boyfriend…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd love to have a sadistic boyfriend myself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to Koharu's story, Mao, Yuika, and finally Sayuki all sighed as they looked into the distance. As these three girls had just gone through a rejection, this conversation must have hit extra deep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Ootori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, Tokihara-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I forgot to ask the most crucial thing. How far have you gone with Akiyama- kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she finished that question, tension filled the room. "Hey! Witch-senpai, you can't ask her that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That kind of topic is taboo for a loli girl like Master…!" "I wonder what Ootori-senpai thinks?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu may be the same age and year as Sayuki, but her body was that of a grade schooler. She was barely 140cm tall, with a not-so-surprising chest size of A cup. Even if she was a legal loli, a loli was still a loli. The big-breasted senior skillfully ignored all the legal questions stemming from this dilemma as she brought up that topic. All the girls swallowed their breaths as Koharu slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a secret~" She flashed a perfect smile like an idol as she avoided the topic altogether.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Around the same time as the girls were engaging in their love talk, Keiki was seated in the classroom of class 2-B in a group of four boys, holding a meeting at a formation of four desks pushed together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The swimming trunks boys are back in action." "Ah, that name is so nostalgic now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's been a while since we tried to cure Nagase-san's hate for men, hasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The swimming trunks boys consisted of Kiryuu Keiki, Akiyama Shouma, Mitani Rin (Boy version), along with an extra.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Swimming trunks boys?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to Keiki was seated an upperclassman who seemed bewildered at this odd boys group name. He was the former committee president of the culture festival execution committee, as well as Onizuka Megumi's current boyfriend</p>
<p class="null-p">-Inui Naoya. The one to answer his question was the ever-joyful Rintarou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The swimming trunks boys are heroes who wore swimming trunks while trying to make a girl laugh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right…?" Naoya still seemed bewildered.</p>
<p class="null-p">He probably wouldn't understand the whole ordeal even if they explained it to him, so they left it at that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, I haven't seen Inui-senpai since the 'Princess Carry Contest' last year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, the event at the aquarium, right? But I think Shouma-kun won that back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The love between me and Koharu-chan was just stronger~"</p>
<p class="null-p">On Christmas Eve last year, Keiki went to a nearby aquarium with Yuika and participated in the previously mentioned event. They had to carry their partner like a princess, and the one who could hold on the longest was crowned the winner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Inui-senpai?" "Yes, Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why exactly are you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, you're asking me that now?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He seemed bored, so I brought him here." "You're one hell of a guy, Rintarou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">According to Rintarou, he brought Naoya with him after finding him staring out of the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I'm shocked you have the guts to call him here after putting him through that hell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Remember what happened during the culture festival? You were working in your girl's uniform, so Inui-senpai got the wrong idea and confessed to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that did happen, right."</p>
<p class="null-p">During the previous year's culture festival, when Naoya was on the executive committee for the culture festival, he developed one-sided feelings for the crossdressing Rin, aka Rinko, only to be rejected with no remorse after his confession. Rumors said that he was pretty depressed after that…</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, Kiryuu-kun. I'm over it already." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Finding out that I just confessed to a boy was indeed shocking, but in the end it brought me and Megumi-chan closer together, so my life's in a happy place now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inui-senpai… so you managed to dispel the Rinko curse."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not treat me like some vengeful ghost?" The junior pouted. He recovered immediately, however, and changed the subject.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Keikun-senpai, what kind of gathering is this supposed to be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, right. I heard that the girls from my club got together for some kind of girls-only meeting and I got kicked out, so I figured I should get the boys together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you having a competition with the girls?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because it sounded fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph… But a girls' gathering sounds fun. I would have loved to be there instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you crossdressed as always, I'm sure nobody would have batted an eye."</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides that thing dangling between his legs, Rinko could play a pretty convincing role of a pretty girl and participate in the meeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what are we going to do here?" Shouma joined in on the conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I didn't really think about that… Well, we can just talk about whatever and deepen our bonds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, then I have a subject I'd like to talk about!" "Out with it, Rintarou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dirty talk!" "Dirty talk, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, lewd stories.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a must-have for a guys' gathering like this! For example, your type of girl, your favorite part of a girl, your favorite bust size, all of that sort of thing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like that would erupt in a battle between the 'big boobs for the win' and 'small boobs are justice' factions."</p>
<p class="null-p">Big boobs or small boobs, that is the question. When it comes to talk between guys, it's hard to avoid the subject.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Rintarou and I are in the big boobs faction, whereas Shouma's got a thing for small boobs. How about you, Inui-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I prefer them adequately sized."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can see myself getting along with Inui-senpai." Shouma and Naoya shook hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">What an odd place to form a new bond.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Senpai's in it for the small tits. Well, Onizuka-san's relatively small."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of Megumin-senpai, you two are dating, right, Inui-senpai? As the vice student council president, she's visited us a few times, and… Wait, hold on!" Rintarou stopped himself mid-sentence and looked at Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Akki-senpai has a legal loli girlfriend, right?" "My angel Koharu-chan, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Keikun-senpai just scored himself a girlfriend with huge knockers…" "My sweet honey Mizuha-san, indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means… I'm the only one here who doesn't have a girlfriend?!" Rintarou caught on to the cruel reality he was in. "Urgh… Why…? I'm so handsome, so why don't I have a girlfriend with big boobs…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because you say gross stuff like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why? Are you saying I'm not allowed to be honest with my feelings? That I have to abandon my lust in order to get a girlfriend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't go that far, but I think it'd be best to not be fixated on breasts like you are."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was quite a crucial problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I cannot step down from the fight. After all, big boobs are justice." "Where do you get all of this passion from…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So introduce me to a girl from the calligraphy club, Senpai. Maybe Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou, would you be able to spank a girl on the butt?" "Huh? There's no way I could do something so cruel." "Then it won't work out with Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because Tokihara Sayuki is a hardcore masochist. The only way to satisfy her is by being a sadist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urgh… I really want a girlfriend…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd love to help you, but it's not like I'm brimming with experience over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had no idea how to win a girl over, so he looked over at Shouma to ask for help, and the representative of handsome boys raised a thumb with a confident smile, as if to say "Leave it to me".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani-kun, can I have a moment?" "Akki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want a girlfriend, then you should first study methods that will get a girl's attention."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such as?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such as treating them gently, praising their hair, anything to show them that you value them in some way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? So such techniques exist?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And if it seems like you have a chance, you should invite her out on a date." "I see… that's reliable information!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou seemed excited to be taught the techniques of love. At least he had</p>
<p class="null-p">cheered up, though it felt like he recovered almost too quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As a reference, what kind of dates have you and Loli-senpai gone on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Just normal dates, you know. Going shopping together, making her wear children's clothes, taking pictures…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that really considered normal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think Koharu-senpai has all the right to get angry."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a lolicon's typical date plan. Since Shouma was a no-good reference, Rintarou now turned towards Naoya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do your dates with Megumin-senpai look like?" "Megumi-chan and I go to the optician pretty often." "Huh? Why an optician…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megumi-chan has a fetish for glasses. A while ago, when I put on my new pair of glasses, she got a nosebleed and passed out. It's a lot of work to carry her back home in that state."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never knew Megumin-senpai was that crazy of a person…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't say she's as bad as a certain person who dresses up as a girl while doing club work." Keiki commented.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, all members of the student council were crazy in their own right. "Then, what about you, Keikun-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do your dates with Mizuha-senpai look like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm… Now that you mention it, we haven't gone on that many dates so far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They had gone out several times together, and they even went on a double date at the amusement park. However, excluding that hot spring trip the other day, they had only gone on a date together right after the Cinderella reveal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't take her out on dates, she might lose interest in you, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be bad, indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Mizuha were somewhat special in their relationship, since a normal couple of high school students couldn't be together all the time. That is why these couples go on dates: To spend more time with each other, learn more about the other person, and deepen their bonds. In a relationship, dates were a necessary factor.</p>
<p class="null-p">With White Day coming up, maybe I should think of something…</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou wasn't the only one who had to study the way love works. Dating itself isn't the goal for Keiki and Mizuha, but rather the beginning of everything, so they needed to make their affection for each other grow even from beyond here. Keiki himself had to learn how to make her happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, a message…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right as Keiki was starting to think, his smartphone vibrated in his pocket. He took it out to confirm who it was, with Shouma taking a peek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it from Mizuha-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, Sayuki-senpai." He said, opening up the message.</p>
<p class="null-p">It said 'Girls Meeting ATM', with a picture added to it, showing the five girls sitting around the table in the calligraphy clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Koharu-chan's participating as well." "I heard they gave her the VIP seat today."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu was as adorable as always. She was making a V-sign while smiling at the camera.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All of the girls in the calligraphy club are so high-level, you know?" "You're right. They're all so pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very end, Rintarou and Naoya also looked at the picture. By the time Keiki realized that he had only looked at his girlfriend in the picture, he couldn't help but laugh at how pure he was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's send them a picture of us as well!" Rintarou suggested. "Yeah, we should show them how close we are." Naoya joined in.</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost as an act of rebellion, Keiki and the others put their shoulders together, taking a picture themselves, adding the text 'Guys Meeting ATM' below. After a few moments passed, Keiki's phone vibrated once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, there it… Huh? It's from Nanjou this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki expected another response from Sayuki, so he was a bit surprised. When he opened the message, it even a threatening and short 'Don't move from there'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki read that, an awful premonition caused shivers to run up his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad! Everyone, run!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gufufufufufu! Sorry for the wait, boys! I'm going to use every single one of you as references for my next BL work!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki sensed the danger a bit too late, and the rotten fujoshi stormed into the boys' meeting. The relaxing atmosphere in the classroom quickly changed into a living hell, with the boys being forced into a photoshoot with the girl's high-quality phone camera.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After some moments passed, they finally managed to get said fujoshi under control, and since it had gotten fairly late, they decided to end the first official boys meeting. Once they returned the desks back to their original positions, Keiki started muttering to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sending them a picture of us was a mistake after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course adding the word 'boys meeting' would catch Mao's attention. After leaving the boys alone, she was already mumbling several concerning comments about her material, so it probably wouldn't take long for her to create a new BL book with all these four boys together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keikun-senpai! We've finished cleaning up here!" "Good work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it's a bit of a shame that it's over. I would have loved to get some more advice from Akki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then we can always do a special meeting another time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akki-senpai…!" Rintarou's eyes lit up as she leaped at Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Keiki was witnessing a marvelous scene between two hotties.</p>
<p class="null-p">I might just invite Nanjou back here again just for that…</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he didn't want to get wrapped up in the mess, so he averted his eyes, and-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">One of the members of the meeting had vanished. "Hey, do you know where Inui-senpai is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He just stepped out into the hallway, I think." "The hallway?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou answered Keiki's question while still clinging to Shouma, so Keiki left the classroom. Without needing to look around, he immediately spotted the person in question. Inui was standing at the window side of the hallway, looking outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inui-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kiryuu-kun, what's up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry that things got so chaotic because of Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I had fun. That was the first time I'd experienced something like that." "I'm glad to hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite going through that, being able to show such a genuine kind impression showed how gentle of a person Naoya was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What were you looking at?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The shaking breasts of the track-and-field club members."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, the shaking… Hold on, what?" Keiki stared at his senior in disbelief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naoya was looking down at the sports ground with a serious gaze, focusing on several girls running along the tracks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, Inui-senpai?" "Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fact that they're shaking means that they're pretty big, right?" "Yep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, you don't actually like small breasts at all, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, keep it a secret from Akiyama-kun and Megumi-chan, okay?" "Ehhhhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't want such a secret shared between the two of them. However, Naoya's jesting tone quickly vanished, as he raised his gaze from the sports grounds with a dejected smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really just wanted to take in this scenery some more. It's the same as when Mitani-kun called out to me. I just keep thinking that this is my last time, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your last time?" Keiki returned the question.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he immediately showed a saddened smile just as Naoya. "We're third-years, so we will be graduating soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">After splitting up with Naoya and the others, Keiki walked through the school building on his way to the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Graduation, huh…? It's already that time of the year."</p>
<p class="null-p">Momosawa High School's graduation ceremony happened on March 10th, which was barely three days from now. It's not like Keiki had forgotten, but he tried not to think about it because it meant saying goodbye to a certain senior of his…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once Sayuki-senpai graduates, the calligraphy club will feel so empty…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She's the only upperclassman in the calligraphy club, and the person he got along with the most. And now, the time of farewells had arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki raised his head after hearing a flustered voice, only to spot Yuika with her coat on. She was standing in the passage that connected to the front entrance from the clubroom building, crossing paths with Keiki, who had just walked down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, Yuika-chan." "Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They exchanged a brief greeting, only for Yuika's face to stiffen. Her charming blonde hair shook, and as her gem-like green eyes stared at Keiki, her cheeks turned ever so slightly red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You beast… monster… boob maniac… panty demon…" "Where is this coming from?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, you're dead to Yuika!" She walked away in anger, her face as red as a tomato.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was left behind, unable to react as he looked after the girl's back. "What was that about…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was used to Yuika's poisonous tongue, but that just now seemed more random than anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's probably on me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? …Ah, Mizuha." Keiki turned around only to be greeted by his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was also wearing her coat, holding her student bag in hand. She had most likely seen that previous exchange between Keiki and Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I told the girls a lot about you and me during our get-together…" "A lot?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Yuika-chan's pretty innocent in that regard, I think it was just too much for her to handle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Too much for her to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The words 'beast' and 'monster' played back in Keiki's mind. Connecting this with the meeting they had, a terrifying hypothesis came up in Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… Mizuha-san, did you-?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They wouldn't let me go otherwise, so I had to tell them about our honeymoon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're joking, right? Is that really something you just let fly at a girls gathering?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know I shouldn't have, but the pressure they put on me was…" "So that's why Yuika-chan reacted that way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Coming to the realization that the male senior she admired was actually a healthy high school student with normal desires must have been a shock for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I was just as shocked when I found out that she was a hardcore sadist…</p>
<p class="null-p">In that sense, he could totally understand Yuika's feelings. However, all boys were secret wolves, so that one couldn't be helped. He decided to not think about it any further for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, let's go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing around forever wouldn't do them any good, so they headed for the shoe lockers, changed into their outdoor shoes, and met up again at the front entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Mizuha. Sayuki-senpai was with you all day today, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, she's still talking with Mao-chan in the clubroom. I think they're getting fired up over BL talk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about her?" "Hm? Nah, it's just…"</p>
<p class="null-p">How should he even go about expressing it? Seeing her older brother at a loss for words, Mizuha closed in on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you planning on cheating right away? Are my boobs too small for you?" "Of course not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, I knew that. You're totally head over heels for me, right?" "Hm… Well, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said that with such a sparkling smile, Keiki found himself flustered once more. If they were at home right now, he probably wouldn't have been able to hold back from hugging her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing much, really. It's just that the third-years will graduate soon, right? That just made me get a bit emotional."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You and Tokihara-senpai were pretty close, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt sad thinking about Sayuki graduating, as they always shared a special bond. This just showed how much fun they had together. She was</p>
<p class="null-p">always the center of the club, causing problems left and right, but every single incident was a precious memory for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… I'd like to send her off with a smile…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was his final duty as a junior. And that filled him with determination. "Alright. Mizuha, can we take a detour on the way home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind, but where to?" "Just look forward to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki came up with the one thing he could accomplish for the soon- graduating Sayuki. It was a send-off typical for the calligraphy club, and Keiki's cheeks formed a smile when picturing what her reaction would be.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">March 9th, a Friday afternoon. After splitting up with his friends Keiki and Mao, Shouma left the classroom and headed for the astronomy clubroom which was used by his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heyo, Koharu-chan." "Ah, Shouma-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma entered the room, finding Koharu standing next to a table. "What brings you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you didn't respond to my message, I thought you'd be here." "Ah, I'm sorry, I left my phone in my bag."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No worries. What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Organizing my pictures. I've taken most of my material and pictures home, but a few are still here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, it looks so barren now." Shouma commented while looking around.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the expensive cameras and the photoshoot studio gone, the astronomy clubroom had returned to the state it was supposed to be in. The only messy place left was the table she was standing next to, which was almost entirely covered in pictures-A great number of them of Shouma himself. Others showed the members of the calligraphy club and student council. Pictures during the culture festival or their Christmas date. Every single picture contained an important memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, this is the photo Keiki took." "How nostalgic."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma picked up the very first picture he and Koharu had gotten together. It happened in the summer of last year, when Keiki became their cupid of love to ensure a smooth first meeting between the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, you were hiding your uniform's ribbon with your hoodie, huh?" "Yes, I hid my school year from you."</p>
<p class="null-p">At their school, you could figure out a student's year from the ribbon on the girls' summer uniform. Back then, Koharu hid her age, so she kept that hoodie on no matter how hot it was outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This picture is my treasure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because it was the first picture we took together?" "That's right. It's my first memory with Shouma-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">During her stalker days, Koharu was always the one behind the lens, so she didn't have any pictures with the two of them. That's why this photo together with the boy she liked was so important to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, our first picture together after we started dating is just as important to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We might just be able to fill an entire album at this point."</p>
<p class="null-p">After they started dating, they'd been on several dates, and even visited each other's homes. Since Koharu liked taking pictures, she would make sure to always take one every time they were together, keeping a record of the development of their love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will that take some more time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm on the last one, so it'll be just a bit longer." "Then let's go home together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I was planning on waiting until you were done either way." "Ehehe, I feel so loved."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu finished her work shortly after that. Since she had gotten done with the major organizing, all that was left was to clean up. She put the pictures into her file booklet, stuffed it into the bag, and locked the door to the room after they stepped outside. Once they handed in the key to the clubroom at the staff office, they changed into their outdoor shoes and walked home. Shouma adjusted his speed to match with his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Shouma-kun?" She looked up at him. "What's up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe, I just wanted to say your name." "Ehhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, just kidding. You kept glancing at me, so I was curious." "I was just looking at you because you're so small and adorable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I'm quite proud of my loli body-although it feels weird to say</p>
<p class="null-p">that." Koharu puffed out her underdeveloped chest and smiled. Even that action alone looked dazzling to Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're in a good mood today, Koharu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well of course. Shouma-kun came to pick me up, so I'm happy. After all, this is the last time we can go home together while I'm wearing this uniform."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, their relationship wouldn't change just because Koharu graduated. If they wanted to see each other, they could always do so. However, they didn't have much more time left as a couple of high school students. The reason that Shouma sought out the girl and headed for the astronomy club was because he felt this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he grabbed her hand, she returned that grip. "Might as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, we might as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma was thankful for Koharu's small stature. The slower she walked, the longer they could be together. Not much time was left until graduation, so he wanted to taste this sweet youth with his beloved girlfriend just a bit longer.</p>

<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: The Pet Girlfriend of the Calligraphy Club</p>
<p class="null-p">On the morning of that day, Sayuki stood in her private room at the Tokihara Estate, taking off the clothes she used as sleepwear. She put on new underwear, then a blouse she had prepared beforehand and buttoned it up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once that was done, she added her ribbon on top and then her blue skirt, pulling its zipper up. Finally, she put her arms through the blazer's sleeves, buttoning that up as well, and she was done.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-All right, perfect."</p>
<p class="null-p">She finished a final check on the mirror, picked up her student bag, and left her room. She walked down the hallway a bit faster than usual. She headed for the entrance and started putting on her shoes when a voice called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, Sayuki-chan, are you leaving already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing behind her was her mother, Tokihara Mifuyu, wearing a bright red kimono. Sayuki made a gentle smile and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I'm prepared for school early." "Yeah, your uniform looks perfect, but…" "Hee hee, I am a perfect beauty as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure, but maybe you should fix your bed head first." "Wha? No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It turned out that Mifuyu was correct. Sayuki took a handheld mirror out from her bag and saw strands of hair standing out from her otherwise glossy smooth hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That wasn't there in the mirror I just checked… A delayed surprise attack…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She made sure that all her hair was fixed, but her sleeping habits must have been exceptionally bad today. She used her fingers to fix her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Father will come today, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Even your shut-in father decided to watch this important moment in your life. He's still hesitant to go outside, but I'll forcefully drag him out there when it's time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How reliable."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the rigid father of hers couldn't win against his wife. Sayuki wasn't the best at dealing with her father, but that part of him was adorable after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Sayuki-chan, you're still fairly early. It's barely 7 am, you know?" "It's fine. I want to get there early today."</p>
<p class="null-p">She finally fixed her bed hair and put her hand on the sliding door at the entrance, turning around as she did so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's something left for me to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">March 10th, a Saturday, was blessed with a clear beautiful sky. Momosawa Private High School held their graduation ceremony without any problems. Even the speech delivered by the third-year representative Shiho was perfect. During the current student council president Ayano's speech, where she teared up mid-way, many other students were washed along with their emotions and also started to tear up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew, Fujimoto-chan's speech was crazy." "Even I was getting teary-eyed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The dam almost broke over here, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the official ceremony was over, Keiki returned to his classroom with his classmates, sharing his impressions of the event with Megumi and Shouma. Setup-wise, Keiki and Shouma sat around the same desk, with Megumi putting hers next to them. As the three were engrossed in praising their common friend Ayano, Mao appeared from behind them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, do you have a moment?" She asked, handing him a plastic bag. "Here you go. Make sure to check it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, thanks a bunch." Keiki accepted the goods.</p>
<p class="null-p">He opened up the plastic bag that was the right size to fit a notebook, and after checking the contents, he made a satisfied nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Great, that's perfect."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sheesh, tell me a bit earlier if you're going to make something like that. I had to finish it at home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry 'bout that, I only came up with it a few days ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I managed to make it in time, so whatever… So what will you do now? I'm going to talk with Master Koharu and Inooka-senpai and then go to the clubroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I need to talk to my other seniors as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Then I'll leave the rest to you, Kiryuu." "Yup. I was the one who came up with it after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki finished his conversation with Mao, Megumi chimed in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-chan, if you're going to the manga research club, can I tag along? I wanna talk to them myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine by me. See you later, Kiryuu." "Yup, later."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki watched the two of them leave the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Onizuka-san's a manga research club member, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though she doesn't show up much because of her work in the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">The otaku princess was now the vice president of the student council. Her relationship with Naoya was progressing smoothly, giving her an odd but sparkly vibe as of late. At the same time, the club members had lost their motivation now that their princess was gone. The reason Mao went to give her regards to the club members was because they had helped her with the manuscript for a magazine previously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing now, Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to go talk to the seniors in my tennis club and then meet up with Koharu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess we can go together half-way then."</p>
<p class="null-p">He put the plastic bag into his student bag, slung that over his shoulder, and left the classroom with Shouma. After walking for a bit, they quickly realized that the atmosphere in the school had changed drastically. People were filling the school grounds, with the third-years with corsages on their chest talking to their juniors. With this sheer amount of people, the third-year classrooms and the clubroom building must be similarly crowded. Amidst this crowd, Shouma spotted a familiar face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, isn't that Mitani-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. It's Rinta… Wait no, it's Rinko this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, Rin was wearing the girls' uniform, which made this the 'Rinko' version. Said Rinko was currently talking to a brown-haired female student with a corsage on her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder who that is? The size of her breasts is no joke at least." "Even an entire group of Koharu-chan's wouldn't put up a fight." Even from a distance, it was evident that the girl was well-endowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, she would stand no fight against Sayuki, but she definitely had more than Mizuha. Right as they were guessing her size, the girl walked away. They approached Rinko, who had been left behind, and called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, Rinko."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keikun-senpai, Akki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The cross-dressing boy turned towards them, showing a smile that was unreasonably cute for a boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence that we'd run into each other here," Rinko said. "More importantly, why are you cross-dressing right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since today is the graduation ceremony, I thought I might go with my formal attire."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wearing a skirt is formal attire for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he should clearly be a boy, the fact that a skirt looked better on him than most girls was absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you go to the graduation ceremony while looking like this, Mitani- kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My homeroom teacher didn't say anything, you know. Well, my male classmates were all like 'Far too cute' and 'I'm getting horny looking at him' and so on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that already a big problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I bet Mao-chan would be happy to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">This would surely turn into some great BL material for her. Weirdest of all was that he felt no discomfort whatsoever while wearing a girl's uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what were you doing, Rinko? We saw you talking with that third-year girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I just confessed to her." "Huh? Confessed? You knew her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, that was our first time meeting. I don't even know her name, but her boobs were so huge and beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You confessed to someone you don't even know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Confessing simply because of the size of someone's breasts was a new low even for this guy. He really came from the planet of boobs, because an earthling would have never been able to pull that off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I immediately fell for her perfect boobs, so I decided to confess my passionate feelings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And then, she said I wasn't what she was looking for." "Well, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">If anything, that comment felt almost too kind towards a pervert who sexually harassed and confessed to you in that way. She must have been a gentle person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still didn't give up despite that, so I proved to her that I am a boy. And then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And then…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She said she'll think about it if I get castrated." "You've got absolutely no chance, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was practically no chance left for Rinko to succeed there, no matter what he did.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did as Akki-senpai told me, and praised her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, you shouldn't go around praising someone's boobs." Especially with someone you've met for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you even confess to a girl you barely met?" Keiki asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A boy from my class said that girls get especially emotional during their graduation, so they're easier to land. That they would fall for you immediately if you just whispered them some sweet words. I spotted a big- boobed girl who suited my tastes, so I tried my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. You're actually the worst possible human being."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both his actions and attempts were impure beyond all limits of rationality. Then again, for a healthy high school boy, it was almost exemplary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being the case, I'll go around trying my luck some more!" "Sure, do your best." Keiki sent Rinko off with a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, he felt the weird urge to support a fellow big boobs enjoyer. "Hey, Shouma, do you think he can get a girlfriend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… if he gets rid of his fixation on big breasts, I'm sure it'll be possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou isn't a bad guy, either…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Girls generally have their own complaints against a boy who enjoys big badonkas. So at this current point in time, Keiki doubted that, riddled with ulterior motives as Rin was, he had any chance. It would probably take a few years for him to get a girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki split up with Shouma, and headed to his first destination, located on the third floor of the classroom building-the student council office. Upon knocking on the door, he heard a faint 'Come in~' from the inside, so he opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Color me surprised, it's Keiki-kun." "Hello, Takasaki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was greeted by the former student council president Takasaki Shiho. She was standing beside the window, with her wavy long hair turned towards Keiki, a corsage on her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just you, Senpai? Where's Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-chan's probably walking around the school talking to her seniors. She has a lot of contacts among the seniors, both former committee members and school council members."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected of the student council president, I guess." Even after the ceremony ended, she was as busy as ever. "Did you have something to talk about with Ayano-chan?" "Ah, no, not exactly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did you come here to confess your love to me, by any chance?" "Not in the slightest. Why would you even think that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I saw it every year, you know? Juniors confessing to their seniors, being swept along by the mood of the graduation ceremony. It seems like it lowers the barriers to confessions, since it's their last chance and all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't tell if that's a good or bad thing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinko had confessed already just now, so it might actually be true. "I mean, I'd always welcome you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. I just wanted to say hello, that's all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho spread her arms wide, which made Keiki feel a bit troubled. Seeing his bothered reaction, however, Shiho lowered her arms and pouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph. How could you not be satisfied with such a beautiful and charming Onee-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that I'm not satisfied, but I have a girlfriend already, and you know that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And a man like you should not be satisfied with that, and should instead aim for a harem!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not the harem king despite what people think, so I'm more than content with one girlfriend. In fact, I'm quite happy with my current situation… Ehehehe…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuck, that's an awful look on your face you have there, Keiki-kun." "Oops, please pay it no mind." Keiki got a grip and controlled his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever he thought about his adorable girlfriend, he wouldn't stop grinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Takasaki-senpai, congratulations on your graduation." "Thank you. Soon I'll be a university student!" "University, huh? I can't really picture that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Better be careful, okay? Once you're a third-year, if you blink once it's graduation for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will keep that in mind." Keiki thankfully accepted the advice of a senior in life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho seemed satisfied with that reaction, and she smiled happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew, these three years passed in the blink of an eye… So much happened, but what was most exciting was the time you were a temporary student council member, I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still remember that vividly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The whole bunny girl incident, the misuse of the club budget, and a lot of other messy things happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And there was one culprit behind all of those problems."</p>
<p class="null-p">The bunny girl outfits for seducing Keiki used up too much of the club budget, all of which was caused by the former club president Sayuki. Ultimately, this led to Keiki being sold to the student council so that he could repay the debt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for helping us back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry about it. The student council finally became a bit more lively thanks to you being around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had fun myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here… And I never expected you to be that great of an individual." "In what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I knew you were popular with the girls, but you finally got yourself a girlfriend now, so I got to taste some delicious NTR towards the end~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's what you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Especially last week. The boy I am curious about went to a hot spring with his girlfriend. It made me feel so good just thinking about it~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, is that why you gave me the tickets?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hee hee, when I heard the rumor that you stayed there for the night, my excitement was through the roof."</p>
<p class="null-p">What a tactician she was. She went above and beyond just to satisfy her fetish. And now she crossed her arms behind her back, approaching Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun?" "What is it now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I actually like you." "Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She may be a pervert, but she was still a beauty, so Keiki blushed upon receiving this confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"See, the way you respond with your everything, and how you blush immediately just makes me want to tease you because you're so adorable. It never gets boring with you around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Shiho's happy grin, Keiki understood that she was just teasing him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It must be because you're constantly playing the straight man. Your reactions are so fun to watch. I'm sure that's why all the girls keep teasing you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a chore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't play the straight act because he enjoyed it. So if that led to him being surrounded by perverts, he wasn't happy about it in the slightest. Keiki felt exhausted after all of this, so he prepared to be on his way.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_14_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I've finished saying goodbye, so I'll be excusing myself now." "Whaaaa? You're leaving already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have some other seniors to talk to, after all." "I see… what a shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then-" Keiki turned around in an attempt to leave the room, putting his hand on the doorknob.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait a second!" "What now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stopped in his tracks and turned around, finding Shiho smiling at him with a different one than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for coming. Let's play again sometime." Finally, she said her true feelings with a genuine smile. "I really can't tell what Takasaki-senpai is thinking."</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the student council office, Keiki moved on to the clubroom building next, muttering to himself. When he thought about it, she had been lying from the very beginning. She saw the harem potential Keiki had in the calligraphy club and worked in the shadows all for her NTR fetish to flourish. In order to fully taste the stimulus she sought out, she also lied about the existence of a stalker. There was also the Christmas incident, in which Shiho worked behind the shadows. Similarly, tasting NTR for her fetish was like a forbidden fruit of sorts. She was on an entirely different level from the sadist and masochist Keiki knew. Of course, Keiki was the only one who knew about her wicked attribute… Maybe she felt more lonely than anybody else.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should invite her to play sometime.</p>
<p class="null-p">With these thoughts in mind, Keiki made his way to the clubroom building. It wasn't quite as busy as the classroom building, but a lot of people were still</p>
<p class="null-p">walking down the hallways. There, Keiki spotted a familiar female student. "Koharu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kiryuu-kun." Koharu answered with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, she wasn't wearing her trademark hoodie, but instead was going with her regular school uniform to show off the corsage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Congratulations on your graduation." "Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you already met up with Shouma?" "No, not yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I guess he's still at the tennis club." "Most likely. But we promised to meet up." "How lovey-dovey."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, are you calling us the best couple in the school? You don't have to~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never said anything like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was as positive as always to the point that it made Keiki feel better.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'm glad I could see you. I was planning on visiting the astronomy club, since I've been in your care all this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've talked a lot, haven't we?" "Yeah, a lot happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even their first encounter was something you wouldn't normally experience. Because of the picture depicting Keiki stuffing his hand right into Sayuki's</p>
<p class="null-p">cleavage, she called him to the astronomy room, and that's when Keiki saw all the pictures of Shouma hanging on the walls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought I was done for after seeing all those pictures of Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, I was a bit too obsessed, yes." Koharu thought back to that time, showing a nostalgic smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This past year has been so much fun. With Tokihara-san, Mizuha-san, and everyone from the calligraphy club, I got to enjoy myself every day, and I even have a wonderful boyfriend now. It's all thanks to you, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because you worked so hard, Koharu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all. Without you, I would have just watched Shouma-kun from the shadows, and that would have been the extent of our relationship. So please, at least me thank you." She smiled gently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like he was the one who should be thanking her. She gave him so much advice, and even took care of Mizuha one time. As Shouma's girlfriend, and someone close to Mizuha, he would surely be able to see her again from time to time. But even so, that final 'Thank you' left Keiki somewhat saddened inside. Even though they barely knew each other for a year, Keiki truly came to treasure her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad I got to meet Koharu-senpai." "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first, I saw you as someone scary, but after talking with you, I realized how much you cared for Shouma. You always helped me, and treasured Mizuha as much as me… so the time we got to spend together is a memory I won't ever forget."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I'd be happy if we could still see each other from time to time</p>
<p class="null-p">after you've graduated!" "Yes, of course!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two shook hands and smiled happily at each other. It truly was a heartwarming scene where both graduate and junior were tearing up. If this was a TV drama, this scene would surely be a hit, and with some good BGM, the atmosphere would even-Suddenly, an ominous presence snuck up behind Keiki's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, Keiki was greeted by a familiar black-haired beauty. She was wearing a corsage on her chest, glaring at the two of them while pouting. She pointed at the handshake between Keiki and Koharu, and spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouldn't that be my position?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Sayuki took Keiki to the calligraphy clubroom on the second floor. She had cleaned up all her personal belongings, making the clubroom look a lot more tidy than usual, and was now sitting on a chair while crossing her legs in dissatisfaction. She was also crossing her arms, which emphasized her chest. Keiki on the other hand wasn't allowed to sit down, simply standing on his two feet while being interrogated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You and Ootori-san sure are close, huh?" "A-Are we now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, are you lying about liking big breasts? Are you a lolicon deep down?" "Not at all, no."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why did you just leave me hanging while talking to Ootori-san? I was wondering why you were taking so long to come here. Am I that unimportant to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh please…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's tone was awfully harsh. It appeared that Keiki had completely ruined his upperclassman's mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you took so long, I would assume that you maybe even visited another girl before Ootori-san? Like… Takasaki-san, maybe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seems like I hit the mark." Sayuki nodded to herself. "For crying out loud, I didn't think you were such an uncaring junior. You came to visit me last, only after fooling around with other girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wasn't fooling around…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? So you were just trying to get me flustered? I guess I've been dancing on top of your palm this entire time. I knew you had it in you to be a hardcore sadist."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I most certainly am not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you say something, Keiki-kun? Were you imagining me stuffing my diploma between my breasts, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I definitely was not!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you just did right after I said that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that I did! That tube would definitely fit right between those giant breasts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And what a sight it would be. It would have been a piece of art, no doubt. Imagining it all, especially the idea of being enveloped between her breasts, made Keiki reach the point where he might have to lean forward, but he just barely held himself back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're ignoring me on such an important day. I don't feel like you have enough love for your favorite pet, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who is my favorite pet again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She may not be his pet, but Keiki still cared for her nonetheless. Just as she said, he had left her alone for a while, so he felt guilty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wasn't neglecting you, it's just… I wanted to get everything else out of the way so I could take my time talking with you last, Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…" Sayuki's eyes shook. "I-I see… what a wonderful mindset."</p>
<p class="null-p">With Keiki's clever way of wording things, Sayuki's mood improved instantaneously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, congratulations on your graduation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, thank you." Sayuki showed him a bewitching smile. "But you ended up graduating before me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"From being a virgin… with Mizuha-san." "Excuse me!?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That statement was just the worst, considering the situation and mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hee, hee. Teasing you really is fun, Keiki-kun. Even though I'm a masochist, I can't help toying with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know why, and I don't care."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, there is something I wanted to show you." "She's not even listening to me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was unsure if he should be happy or worried that the girl had cheered up. Sayuki for her part stood up, walking to the small tatami area. She picked up a calligraphy paper from the low table and brought it to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, you can have this." "This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki accepted the paper, upon which the words 'Be Oneself' were written. The letters were all over the place, seeming out of order, and yet it created an overall balance that made it a treat to look at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When did you even make this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been practicing for a while now, but I just finished it this morning. I came to school early to get it done. I didn't want everyone to see me make it in the afternoon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As the senior in the club, I wanted to leave behind one final product of my hard work. Anything big would probably get in the way, so I kept it small."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much. We'll make good use of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was small enough that they could hang it up basically anywhere. The wall would probably be the best place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why 'Be Oneself'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because the calligraphy club was the place where I belonged. It's true that his final year was the most enjoyable in my entire life so far, but that's because I didn't have to hide my fetish. I could be who I was, and that's what made it so comfortable for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like you were a bit too honest with yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">A place that allowed her to be herself… That's why she felt so comfortable here at the calligraphy club. The reason it brought together a group of perverts was nothing more than a coincidence, and their connection as kindred spirits was born simply because of the Cinderella incident, allowing everyone to be themselves openly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether it be a masochistic molester girl who wished to be someone's pet, or a sadistic girl who wanted to make other men her slave, or a fujoshi who appreciated love between men, or an exhibitionist who wanted other people to see her naked… In this room, with these people, they didn't have to hide anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Personally, I would have been fine if they held back a bit…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's stance hadn't changed since the very beginning. He never wanted to taste panties again, nor did he want to see himself being used as material for a BL book. However, he began to accept even those flaws. Of course, he had no intention of becoming their owner or slave. However, he also didn't want to ruin the friendships they had. Even if their values were different, there was no need to reject each other. Understanding and sympathy isn't always important if you care for the other person. That is how Keiki spent the past year with all of these perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, I have something I want to give you as well, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki put the paper down on the table and opened his student bag. He took out the plastic bag, offering it to the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is from everyone in the calligraphy club." "Is this… a collection of autographs?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Since we're part of the calligraphy club, we wrote them with ink."</p>
<p class="null-p">After accepting the colored paper, she ran her eyes along it. It had messages from Keiki, Mizuha, Yuika, and Mao, all of them for Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This drawing in the center… is that me?" "Yes, I asked Nanjou to draw that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a small character modeled after Tokihara Sayuki, drawn by Mao. It looked like something out of a manga, but it still retained her proportions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm even holding a small brush. That's adorable. As expected of Nanjou-</p>
<p class="null-p">san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she really is talented."</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite the unfamiliar territory, she managed to nail it perfectly. After having gotten a fill of the drawing, Sayuki checked out the messages.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Thank you very much for the past two years! Please do your best at university and during your studies!'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Thank you for everything. Yuika will have bigger boobs than Witch-senpai in no time, so you'd better be ready!'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Show up at one of my events sometime. I'll prepare a signed book for you.' 'Spending time with you in the club was very fun. Thank you very much.'</p>
<p class="null-p">These messages weren't anything special, but they each came from the heart to thank someone important to them. They did add their names at the end, but it was pretty obvious who wrote which message. Keiki was curious about Sayuki's reaction, so he glanced at her. She was looking down at the paper, quietly shedding tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry, I just didn't expect this, so I'm a bit surprised." "That's fine, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't sure what to do, but Sayuki wiped her tears away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you about the seniors from the calligraphy club when I was a first- year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, the ones who always doted on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had told him about this during their amusement park date last year. While giving Keiki a lap pillow, Sayuki told him stories of the seniors who graduated already. Back then, Sayuki was the only first-year, so they really</p>
<p class="null-p">doted on her and patted her on the head all the time, making them sound like kind and gentle people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When they graduated, they all gave me the exact same thing, a paper full of messages and drawings for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also prepared something similar for them, but since I was the only junior, it was just something like an autograph instead… And even so, they were really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They sound like great people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. And I was just reminded of back then." "Ahh, so that's why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing the reason for her tears, Keiki felt relieved. At least she wasn't crying out of sadness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really am blessed. I'm liked by both seniors and juniors alike… and even acquiring a wonderful master with Keiki-kun right at the very end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't nonchalantly fabricate a fake reality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, it was just a light-hearted joke." Sayuki pouted with a sulking tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she immediately smiled again, gently embracing the colored paper. "Thank you, Keiki-kun. I'm… really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a dazzling smile brighter than the sun entering the room. That smile warmed Keiki's heart. He decided not to cry, but he could feel tears welling up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wanted to talk more with you, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to stay in the same club a bit longer." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really sad that you have to graduate today." "Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki confessed all of the feelings stored in his chest. He planned to send her off with a smile, but he couldn't control his emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy you feel that way, Keiki-kun." "Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll still show up from time to time as the calligraphy club's special guidance member."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, it felt like time itself had stopped. This unexpected development left Keiki unable to keep up at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What? Hold on, a special guidance member?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, did I not tell you? I already received permission from Okita-sensei to show up at the clubroom from time to time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I ever heard of that, though?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A special guidance member? Keiki didn't even know that sort of thing existed. Then again, it wasn't that rare for seniors to stop by at their old clubs as coaches.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The heck…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt all the strength in his body vanish, and he leaned against the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mentally, he was too exhausted to even think about anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, were you that sad to see me graduate, Keiki-kun? You were about to cry, right? Awww, such a cute boy~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yikes… I feel so betrayed and annoyed…" Keiki grumbled, as Sayuki poked her long finger at his cheek. "I have a whole slew of things to say, but for starters, please give me back my tears."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, no thank you. I'll keep them locked away in my chest so that I never ever forget about them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Keiki couldn't utter another word was that Sayuki's smile was so pretty he was entranced for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Damn it, she sure can be cute if the conditions align…</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected of his first love. That smile made him fall in love before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, since that's how it is, nothing much will change even if I graduate. In this day and age, I can always contact you whenever, and if you call for me, I'll come running without a second's hesitation, just as if I was your adorable pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you really need to add that last part?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving aside that part about her being a pet, Keiki felt relieved to hear Sayuki say that. Now there was no need to be sad even if she graduated. Just as she said, he could always contact her and meet her whenever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope we can hold another club camp this year." "You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll make sure to bring some more whisky bonbons with me." "Please do not."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the camp they held near the sea, all of the girls ended up drunk because of their weak resistance against alcohol, and started taking off their clothes in a wild storm. Keiki didn't want to live through that nightmare ever again. But as if to speak of the devil, the other club members appeared in the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sup, we're here~" "Hello!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao, Mizuha, and Yuika walked inside the room. Mao was the first one to realize that something was off about those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Why are you two just standing around like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen to this, Nanjou-san! Keiki-kun apparently didn't know that I would be acting as the special guidance member of the club, so he was so sad that I was graduating that he started crying!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?! Why are you telling her that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite her having cried herself… "Oh really, Kiryuu cried?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did nobody tell Nii-san about the special guidance member part?" "Nope. Also, I didn't cry." Keiki repeated his point.</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyes were red, so it was probably obvious, but his pride as a man didn't allow him to be honest. But there was something else he was curious about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, aren't you standing a bit far away from me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It must be your imagination, Keiki-senpai." Or so she said, but that most likely wasn't the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite the three of them having entered the clubroom at the same time, she</p>
<p class="null-p">stood furthest away from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess she is avoiding me after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for that surely must be the girls' meeting, but he couldn't do anything about that now. Now that the graduation ceremony had ended, all the club members had gathered in the club room, and there was only one thing left to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that we're all here, let's take a commemorative picture!" The new club president, Keiki, brought up that idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perfect timing! Leave the photoshoot to us!" "It seems we still made it in time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Okita-sensei? Tachibana-sensei?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, two female teachers entered the clubroom. One of them was Teacher Okita, acting as the advisor of the calligraphy club, and the other was the madonna of the infirmary, Nurse Tachibana. Both of them were holding cameras.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll take the pictures for us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, our school sends out a graduation album a few days after the ceremony, so we're going around taking pictures of the various clubs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just being led around as Okita-sensei's assistant." Teacher Tachibana said, but the group was thankful for the arrival of the two photographers.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was much better than relying on Keiki's smartphone all the time. "Alright, then get together and line up, everyone! Let's take this picture!" "Okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everybody obeyed Teacher Okita's orders, moving together. To create the</p>
<p class="null-p">necessary atmosphere, they all took off their slippers and moved onto the tatami area. This was the perfect place to take a group picture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, Witch-senpai, you need to be in the center." "Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll stand next to Senpai," Mizuha commented. "With me and Nanjou in the back, yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The positions of the five were decided quickly. Sayuki sat in the center, with Yuika to her left, Mizuha to her right, all of them on their knees, with Mao and Keiki standing behind them. Amid this group, Keiki stood behind his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, why don't you hold onto this for now?" "You're right, let's do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki handed Sayuki the calligraphy paper which said 'Be Oneself'. She held this and the very first memento she had received from her seniors up so that the camera could see.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, time to take the picture!" "Make sure you smile!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Teacher Okita pointed her camera at them, with Teacher Tachibana giving a comment. Right after, the black-haired senior pulled all of them together, all of them surprised but smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, say cheese!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the shutter could be heard inside the classroom. Surely, none of them would ever forget this moment for the rest of their lives. They looked like a perfectly normal group of club members. Even if the girls were all</p>
<p class="null-p">perverts of varying degrees, they accepted each other and got along. And this one picture they took turned out so perfect that there was no need to retake it.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The weekend passed, and soon it was lunch break on the following Monday. The three swimming trunks boys had gathered in an empty classroom. After finishing lunch, Shouma called the boys together, only for them to find Rintarou resting his head in his arms while leaning against the desk. Keiki narrowed one eye and called out to his friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly is going on here, Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He said that he tried his luck with Tokihara-senpai and confessed to her during the day of the graduation ceremony, but he got rejected in a heartbeat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuuuh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation suddenly changed gears significantly. Seeing his junior slumped against the desk like a defeated slime, Keiki carefully called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou… you confessed to Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, well… I figured I might as well try my luck…" "You wanted a girlfriend with big boobs that badly…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To think he even went for Sayuki-senpai of all people. But it must hurt his pride being rejected over and over like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? What are you doing here?" "Ah, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he turned towards the voice that called out to them, there stood Airi. She happened to pass by on pure coincidence, and her beige-colored twintails shook as she entered the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You three again. Are you coming up with some kind of weird swimming trunks plan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Never again, don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was something wrong with them back at the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, why does Mitani look like a balloon that lost all of its air?" "Ahh… he confessed to Sayuki-senpai but was rejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welp…" Airi looked like she couldn't care less. She probably regretted even asking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just out of curiosity, how did you confess to her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said that I fell for her smile, so I wanted her to go out with me…" "…Huh? That's… actually fairly normal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. Knowing Mitani-kun, I thought he'd bring up something about her boobs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think I did anything bad this time either…" The three honestly were a bit confused at that fact.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what did Sayuki-senpai say when she rejected you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That she didn't feel comfortable when I was staring at her chest the entire time while confessing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you were staring at them?" "Of course she'd reject you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuck. You're the worst, Mitani…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the blink of an eye, their evaluation of Rintarou dropped to an all-time low. Of course, Airi's gaze was as cold as ice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urk… I'm from the planet of boobs after all… Girls on earth are lifeforms that won't give me any attention…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh no, he's sulking for real now." "Because he's been rejected non-stop l."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jesus… you never change, Mitani…" To everyone's surprise, Airi approached Mitani, calling out to him with a gentle voice. "Listen, Mitani. You might actually be the worst kind of person, but I think it's admirable that you've stayed true to your desires while confessing, you know? I definitely wouldn't be able to do that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, it felt like she looked over at Keiki, but before Keiki could question that, she had already turned towards Rin again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why you should give up, and move on to the next love. Look for the perfect girl with a huge chest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san…" Rintarou slowly raised his head, staring at the girl standing in front of him. "…You're so kind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might like Nagase-san…" "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Won't you go out with me with marriage in mind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuuuuuuuh?!" Airi's face turned beet red, unable to handle the sudden confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than being bashful, she seemed like she couldn't follow this turn of events at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hold on?! You like girls with huge chests, right? I'm not that big, you know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't even care anymore… I want to marry Nagase-san…!" "Wah, Mitani?! What are you saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn, that's unexpected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani-kun's the kind of guy who falls for others easily, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you two! Why are you just calmly analyzing the situation! Help me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, Rintarou had begun to cling to Airi, his pupils having changed into hearts. Of course, as the girl still wasn't fully over her hate towards men, this was torture. She looked over at Keiki and Shouma in a plea for help, so they assisted in separating the two. Airi was beet red, fuming with anger, but Rintarou wouldn't let up despite that. Although they felt bad for Airi, they also somewhat enjoyed the situation. It wasn't just their precious seniors who were now gone. They now had juniors they had to look after, inheriting this role from Sayuki, Koharu, and Shiho.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_14_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Of course, Rintarou was once again rejected by Airi. After hearing a cold and sharp 'No way I would ever go out with Mitani' from Airi, Mitani Rin's heart was broken yet again.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Would You Be Able To Love A Pervert If They're Handsome?</p>
<p class="null-p">This happened on the following afternoon after the graduation ceremony, March 11th, which was a Sunday. In a cafe near the train station, two beautiful women entered the cafe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, there he is! Kei-kun!" "Hello there, Kei-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">While waving their hands, the Akiyama sisters approached Keiki. The one wearing casual pants with short hair was the older sister Akiyama Asahi, whereas the pure-looking girl with long hair and a skirt was Akiyama Yuuhi. Despite having the same face, they acted completely differently as they sat down in front of Keiki. After the waitress arrived, they ordered a soda and a cafe au lait respectively. Once their drinks arrived, Keiki spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for calling you over during a weekend like this." "It's totally fine. Both Yuuhi-chan and I had time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what did you want to talk about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I wanted to ask something of you two mature ladies."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, Keiki called them here because he wanted advice on something. The reason he relied on the two sisters instead of Shouma or Koharu is that this was a topic he was rather uncomfortable with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please teach me adult techniques that will make a girl fall head over heels for me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Adult techniques?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to make my girlfriend happy!" "Your girlfriend happy?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sisters blushed. The part about wanting to make her happy sounded a bit dubious, but it was most likely just their imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be perfectly honest, I'd been practicing already before going out with her, so I've got some experience."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Huh… So Kei-kun did a lot even before dating her…" "Kei-chan is actually quite the player?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Player? Well, we went to the movies, the shopping mall, and stuff like that, but I don't want to go to standard places. I'd rather go on a more mature date!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing that exclamation from Keiki, Asahi and Yuuhi blinked at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? You're asking for dating advice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought this was about advice for nightly activities…" "Huh? Nightly activities?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry, don't pay it any mind, Kei-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, we just got the wrong idea for a moment, so don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two sisters showed awkward smiles and quickly hid their mistake. Keiki was confused, but as it was a problem between the two of them, he didn't comment on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that makes sense. We might be able to help you with that." "You're right, we know how to get a good mood going."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, as expected of university girls! So reliable!" To the point they looked like goddesses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe, now I feel motivated!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We gotta show off our skills now! We'll make sure to come up with the best possible date plan so that your girlfriend will be head over heels for you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They seemed happy to be relied upon, and they declared this with a smile. "Just leave it to us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">March 14th was White Day. Since he had received lots of chocolate, Keiki was busy bringing around cookies to his friends. The first one was for his classmate Nanjou Mao, who said she would eat them during her break from working on the manuscript. She seemed happy. Next up was Fujimoto Ayano, who he encountered in the hallways. She indulged in Keiki's scent leftover on the bag, and evidently seemed happy. Finally was the third person. To avoid the prying eyes of other people, he called Airi to a passageway to hand her the plastic bag with cookies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks a lot for the chocolate. It was delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that." Airi accepted the bag, showing a gentle smile. "Ah, I really like these. I'll eat them after I get home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, feel free…" "Hm? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just thinking that you've sure opened up a lot lately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? W-Where did that come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you just accepted my present pretty easily. Before, you would never even bother with a guy like me because of your distaste for men, so I thought this was great progress."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…" Airi said like she had realized what he meant, and smiled. "If so, then that must be because of your special training, Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just where did the cold and distanced man-hating Airi wander off to? Her smile was charming to the point that it utterly entranced Keiki, and if he managed to assist in such a positive change, then he felt honored.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, I'd like to repay Yuika-chan for her chocolate…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I believe she was eating lunch in her classroom, and then wandered off somewhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't you just contact her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did, but recently she hasn't been answering my calls…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the exact opposite of Airi, now Yuika was distancing herself from Keiki. However, Keiki had a feeling he knew the reason for that. Most likely, Yuika still wasn't over the scene of Keiki putting on Mizuha's panties for her in the library room. Additionally, the fact that Mizuha told the girls about her first time with Keiki probably didn't help. Realizing that Keiki was in fact a healthy high school boy must have been a huge shock for Yuika, which led to this mess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you have a fight with Yuika?" "Not exactly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder. You tend to do things that aren't exactly ethical, Kiryuu-senpai." "Do I really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you forgotten that bunny girl incident? And you've even seen my panties before…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The perpetrator of the bunny girl incident was Sayuki-senpai, and the panties incident was an accident."</p>
<p class="null-p">As the temporary student council member that Keiki was at the time, he helped Airi with her work, when she slipped from the ladder and revealed her pure white panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though not many of those things happened with Nagase-san…</p>
<p class="null-p">At least compared to the overwhelming amount with Yuika. When it comes to lucky pervert moments, she probably held the top spot. Touching her breasts on accident, burying his face in her butt, having her panties stuffed into his mouth (there he was the victim at least)… Just remembering all of these seemed crazy to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that I think about it, I haven't talked with Yuika-chan much since Mizuha and I started dating…</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they would regularly run into each other because of club activities or committee work, the rumor related to Mizuha made everything a bit complicated and left Keiki busy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I look for Yuika?" Airi asked. "Thanks, but I'll go have a look some more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, I'm sure that would make her happier as well." That aside, Keiki wanted to talk with Yuika directly. "Oh yeah, how are things with you and Rintarou lately?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, him…" Airi's expression immediately changed to disgust. "He's been proposing to me almost daily now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Quite a passionate approach from a playboy like Rintarou. Then again, he was always the type to act first and think later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But since he's not giving up after being rejected once, he might actually be serious for a change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder about that. I'm sure he'll give up soon enough. Not to mention that I don't have any intentions of going out with him, and he only likes girls with big breasts. He must be out of his mind after getting rejected over and over."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to show that she was done talking about that, Airi's expression changed back into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about you, Kiryuu-senpai? How are things with Mizuha-senpai lately?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's working out just fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I doubt you and Mizuha-senpai would fight much." "Well, I don't think I've ever seen her angry, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, Mizuha was quick to sulk whenever Keiki was getting along with another girl, which led to her going full commando as a way of relieving stress, so she was at least emotional to a certain degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since today's White Day, why not invite her out on a date?" "We actually already have plans for this afternoon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How passionate." "I'm doing my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd best treasure her, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's totally wasted on me, to be honest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I personally think you two are a good match. Whenever I've seen you</p>
<p class="null-p">recently, you've looked like a wonderful couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, really? That makes me happy, at least." Keiki grinned.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least when it came to that, Airi wasn't joking around, so Keiki believed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, shouldn't you be looking for Yuika now? Lunch break will end at this rate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I almost forgot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki had plans during the afternoon, he really wanted to talk with Yuika during lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've gotta get going then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… And thank you very much for the cookies." Airi said, gently waving her hand in front of her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sent off by his gentle junior's smile, Keiki walked down the hallway. "Mmm… I really thought Yuika-chan would be here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After separating with Airi, Keiki immediately moved to the library room. It must have been because the seniors all graduated, but not a single soul was present. Temporarily, this place was famous for the rumor 'The Blonde Angel's Library Room', which referred to Koga Yuika, but looking around now, there was nobody to be seen. Keiki turned around, thinking of looking somewhere else, when he remembered one place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He trusted his intuition and moved towards the back of the library room. It was a quiet storage room usually not touched by anybody except the library committee members. Keiki slowly opened the door. Moving through the bookshelves, he spotted Yuika sitting on the ground, with her back to the wall below the window, reading a book. Her golden hair looked like it was sparkling even amidst the dimly-lit room. Her green eyes were fixated on the</p>
<p class="null-p">pages, creating a perfect scene. "Found you, Yuika-chan." "Huh? …K-Keiki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki called out to her, Yuika's body twitched and she stood up in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why are you here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I was searching for you. Knowing how much of a bookworm you are, I figured you'd be in the library room. Though I didn't expect you to move to the back storage." He explained while approaching her, offering her a plastic bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, this is thanks for your Valentine's chocolate." "Ah… thank you…" Yuika reluctantly accepted the present. However, she immediately took her distance from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yep. She's still as distant as before…</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like she was being cautious of Keiki. Most likely after what had happened between him and Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon enough, this'll impact our work at the club, so I really should try to make up with her, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of a single difference in mindset, it could bring the whole club down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then Yuika will leave now!" "Ah, wait, I'm not done-"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this rate, she would run away once more, so Keiki panicked and closed the distance between them… However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His foot slipped on a piece of paper lying on the floor. "Waaaah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He lost his balance, unable to get back on his feet, opening his arms wide as he fell forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch… Wait, what is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he raised his head, he felt like his hands were holding onto something. It felt familiar to him, with silky smooth fabric…</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, it's Yuika-chan's skirt, all right.</p>
<p class="null-p">He seemed to have toppled forwards and pulled down Yuika's skirt as he fell. In other words, he succeeded in a beautiful diving catch.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that means…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki carefully raised his head, only to find Yuika's panties smiling back down at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh lord help me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He saw his own death approaching, his face as pale as grey ash. The girl whose panties were revealed was shaking violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan…?" "Hehehehehehe…" "You're scaring me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She sounded like a broken radio.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Every single time with your lucky pervert nonsense… Do you want to be punished by Yuika that badly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being sincere with girls was Kiryuu Keiki's mentality. He would never do such a thing as sexualy harassing them on purpose. However, that kind of excuse most certainly did not work with his sadistic junior. She pulled up her skirt, opened the zipper, and took off her panties, opening them up right in front of Keiki's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you like Yuika's panties that much, she might as well stuff them into your mouth again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please no mooooooooooooooooore!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_14_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Like this, Keiki was punished-or rather lectured by the fiendish enraged Queen once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, Keiki was groveling on the floor of the storage room, wearing his junior's panties on his head. If somebody saw him like this, his life would be over in an instant. However, the great Yuika-sama ordered him to remain in this pathetic position. This very Yuika-sama now stood in front of Keiki, with crossed arms like a king giving out orders. Her presence was unimaginable from a girl wearing no panties, her expression still riddled with fury.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For crying out loud, you are just…" "I have no excuses…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really shouldn't do this sort of stuff with Mizuha-senpai." "If anything, she'd probably be happy about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika would have loved to disagree with that, but she just remembered that Mizuha-senpai is a pervert as well. It's easy to forget, really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Normally, she's just a normal girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is the same, remember? She may enjoy bullying men, but she usually puts on a mask and acts innocent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The instant you act innocent, you're definitely not normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't want to hear that from the person who is wearing panties on his head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You made me wear them, no?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she forced him into this, she most definitely was the pervert into the situation. However, Yuika knew that he had no way of complaining now, so she flashed him a fiendish grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have guts talking back to Yuika in such a situation. Why don't we take</p>
<p class="null-p">some pictures?" "Please, I beg you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuuh? If Yuika had a picture of this scene, she could threaten you for all eternity."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I don't want you to take one!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, forcing you to wear Yuika's panties to the point you dislike it this much… The sight of you makes Yuika shiver in pleasure~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's been a while since I've seen sadist mode Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like a fish on land. It was like an undying mummy was coming to chase after him. Yuika seemed to be satisfied, though. She pulled the panties off Keiki's head and put them back on herself. Now that he was forgiven, Keiki finally stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Yuika is relieved." "Relieved about what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you started going out with Mizuha-senpai, it felt like you suddenly went somewhere far away." Her green eyes were directed at Keiki as she confessed her feelings. "Surely, Yuika must have been scared… realizing that Keiki-senpai became an adult… and that you become someone else's.</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone who isn't Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you were avoiding me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the girl was actually very emotional and clingy at times, she probably couldn't keep up with the sudden change in their relationships.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, Yuika doesn't enjoy the idea of the boy she likes going around flirting with another girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The second you started dating, you immediately offered her the virginity you treasured so much, no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wasn't actively treasuring it, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Yuika was a bit worried because of that, but… in the end, you haven't changed at all, and stayed the same Senpai who enjoyed pulling down Yuika's skirt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that the image you have of me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you forgotten all the times you've practically sexually assaulted Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am terribly sorry for everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki instantaneously apologized for his crimes. Fondling her chest, pushing his face into her behind… all of these things had actually happened, so Keiki had no room to argue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, Keiki-senpai really is an honest pig." "Can you not say that with a smile?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What a horrible impact to experience. Hearing the word 'Pig' from such an adorable junior was surreal, to say the least.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The lewd pervert Keiki-senpai made a beautiful dive to pull down Yuika's skirt all to see her underwear, no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again, it was just an accident."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If everything was seen as an accident, we wouldn't need any police officers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That argument left Keiki speechless. Thinking about it, it may have been an accident, but he still pulled down a girl's skirt. Being let off by only wearing</p>
<p class="null-p">her panties might have been an easy punishment. "You'd better reflect on that, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I will be careful from now on." "One more thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's still more?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, you've been only having eyes for Mizuha-senpai, right?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Flirting all day, just staring at each other in the clubroom… You're totally head over heels for each other."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were we flirting that much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You weren't even aware of it? Oh lord…" Yuika looked at Keiki in disbelief. "Well, I get that Mizuha-senpai is first since the two of you are dating, but it wouldn't hurt to give Yuika some attention now and then, no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked like an abandoned puppy. Realizing that Keiki was at fault for making her feel this way, he felt his chest hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine. Yuika got to punish Keiki-senpai a lot today, so Yuika came up with something good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What exactly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just because Yuika's slave suddenly got a girlfriend doesn't mean that Yuika has to hold herself back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Come again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter if Senpai has a girlfriend. A dog faithful to its owner just</p>
<p class="null-p">needs to be punished until he's colored by none other than Yuika only." "Yuika-chan?! That sounds mighty violent if you ask me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Yuika will make sure to train Keiki-senpai plenty so that you'll swear allegiance to Yuika!" She declared like the sadist that she was and clung to Keiki's arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">A sweet scent drifted up his nose, and the softness pressed against him made his heart race.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan…? Um, I have a girlfriend now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? This much should be fine. Yuika is just a clingy and adorable junior." "No, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or, are you so much of a pervert that you'll start feeling weird just because Yuika is clinging to you like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was weak against that argument. Rejecting her too strongly would mean that he was conscious of her. In the end, he would play right into her hand no matter what he did.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, Yuika-chan's gotten better at finding the weakness of other people…</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no way any boy would not be conscious of Yuika in this situation. In fact, this kind of sweet skinship had almost won Keiki over many times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, you need to spoil Yuika some more in the future, okay?" "…In the sense of a relationship between senior and junior, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, it was Keiki's complete loss. Because of the girl's smile, he was unable to return anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">That smile definitely fits Yuika-chan better.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had an arrogant smile on her face, and it was cute to the point Keiki couldn't fight against it. Although the incident with the skirt may have happened, Keiki was glad that she was happy again.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">During the evening on White Day, Keiki took Mizuha to a nighttime pool in the neighboring town. It was located on the highest floor of a large hotel close to the train station, and since the walls and ceiling were built out of glass, you could easily see outside, which made it a popular dating spot. By the time they went into their respective changing rooms, the sun had begun to set, the sky was colored a deep orange, which created the perfect stage and atmosphere for nighttime swimming.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is amazing. It feels like we're actually outside." Mizuha raised a voice of excitement after setting foot towards the poolside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad we got clear weather today. And a clear moon to boot." "Yep. Thanks for bringing me here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my White Day present after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, why are you holding your head like that, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My girlfriend looks so adorable in her swimsuit that I'm in pain over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was always cute no matter what she wore, but tonight was just on an entirely different level. With her snow-white bikini, she looked like an angel that had descended upon this pool. Along with her beautiful facial features, she had the right proportions where it mattered despite her slim waist, and her skin looked so white that it was almost transparent. All of these factors combined to the point that his beloved girlfriend's beauty blinded Keiki, and he wanted all of her to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are white bikinis such a piece of art?" "Nii-san, your eyes are doing lewd stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oops, excuse me." Keiki had gotten a bit too heated. "Your swimsuit looks great on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is my first time showing you, right? I bought a new one just for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was absolutely adorable. Almost to the point Keiki didn't want any other men to see her, but since the pool was currently filled with several couples and office lady-type women, he didn't have to worry too much. And with all that out of the way, the two of them immediately checked out the pool.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels so weird going to the pool in March." "You're not cold, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine. The temperature is perfect in here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they still had to wear their coats outside, at least the indoor pool was comfortably warm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've been to a pool at night, but this is pretty fun." "Same here. It's a lot calmer than I anticipated."</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably because most of the people present were actually adults. Nobody would play pranks or cause a ruckus at a public pool. They were simply enjoying each other's company, conversing about this and that. Others were relaxing on the poolside chairs. Rather than coming to an amusement facility, it felt like they had walked into a cafe to drink tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected of the top-hit date spot Asahi-san and Yuuhi-san told me about.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki mentally thanked the two women for giving him this great piece of information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why a night swim for our date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I guess it's not typical for high school students to go on a night swimming date."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right, I didn't expect it at least."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I wanted to go on a normal date with you. But watching a movie or going to the shopping mall are things we could even do as siblings, so I wanted something a bit more high-class, something you would only do as a couple, so I chose a special date spot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which is here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. Here, nobody would think of us as siblings, right?" "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a date spot for mature and experienced couples and adults. Following that logic in reverse, nobody here would think that the two of them were siblings. Instead, they looked like a normal couple to everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like… I'm being treated like a girl right now…" "Do you like it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah! I'm really happy about this date." Mizuha stood inside the pool, showing the smile of a blooming flower.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite this being the way Keiki was trying to repay her, he felt like he'd gotten an additional reward instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I knew it when you gave me the ring, but you can be pretty romantic, Nii- san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're just too easy, really. You can feel free to be a bit more selfish at times."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like both watching movies and window shopping. Just watching a movie at home is fun for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, that's just like you, all right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt a bit worried at how easy to please Mizuha was. At least in front of</p>
<p class="null-p">her boyfriend, she could ask for something more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I always get to enjoy the feeling of being special." "Meaning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being able to be with my beloved Nii-san makes me feel very special. I would probably get punished if I asked for anything more than this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…" He gently smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's girlfriend was far too gentle and lovable. It made him want to embrace her-Or rather, he already had started to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nii-san…?" From between Keiki's arms, Mizuha showed an oddly flustered reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, her cheeks turned red, and she seemed a bit anxious. "We can't do that here… not with other people around…" "The lights aren't as bright here, so nobody will see us." "But-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before the girl could say anything else, Keiki pressed his lips onto hers. Because Keiki was a lot taller than Mizuha, he covered her whole body so the people on the poolside probably had no idea what they were doing. Keiki made these excuses to himself and continued to rain sweet kisses onto his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san… No…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt his body being pushed away. He worried that he might have actually angered Mizuha, but he quickly realized that wasn't it. Rather than rejection, the emotion residing in her eyes was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't… If you keep kissing me here, I won't be able to hold back anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Behind this sweet proclamation, her eyes were dampened with desire, entrapping her older brother so that he would never be able to escape. It appeared as if the abundant amount of kissing had flipped her switch, making it look like she has heart symbols for pupils.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The rest… we'll do after we get home, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the sweet invitation Keiki's blushing girlfriend uttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The day after the wonderful pool date with his girlfriend, right after the final homeroom ended, Keiki was walking through the clubroom building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-senpai, good work today." "Oh, Yuika-chan, same to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I wonder why we greet each other like that every day after school?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe to say that we worked hard during classes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki happened to run into Yuika on the way to the clubroom building, discussing whatever came to their mind, when-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu…!" "Woah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with a shriek, Keiki felt an impact hitting his back. The problem was what happened after that. Keiki turned around, only to find a teary-eyed Mao clinging to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nanjou…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't something the always-calm Mao would usually do. From her</p>
<p class="null-p">attitude alone, Keiki realized that something was going on. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He asked with as kind of a voice as possible, and Mao looked up at him. "…Um."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…?" "It… it happened." "…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because you worked so hard… and did so much for me… It finally happened!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now hold on?!" Keiki doubted his ears. "Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing a cold voice nearby, Keiki spotted Yuika's pale expression. "You have Mizuha-senpai, and yet you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no no, nothing happened! I've only got eyes for Mizuha! I'm not going to cheat on her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He swore to never do that. So to clear his name, he asked the person in question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou! Yuika-chan has an awful misunderstanding right now, so please explain what's going on!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Okay." Mao seemed to have calmed down, and she moved away from Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wiped the tears from her face and began explaining. "I just got a call from my editor…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your editor?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, my editor. They had a serialization meeting today… and they said that they would put my manga into a serialization slot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whoa, a serialization?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-senpai's manga is getting serialized?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Keiki and Yuika couldn't hide their surprise. Mao began tearing up again like she still couldn't believe it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I do…? Kiryuu, I actually managed to debut…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">So what had finally happened was her debut. Keiki would have preferred for Mao to not mix things up with poor phrasing like that, but he still was happy for her. And from that day onward, Minami Mao-sensei's shoujo manga 'Would You Be Able To Love A Pervert If They're Handsome?' was greenlit for serialization.</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, inside the Kiryuu Household's living room, the usual club members sat around a low table, enjoying a banquet of food. The ones who had gathered were the four from the calligraphy club, sans Sayuki however, but plus Shouma and Koharu. Starting with Keiki and proceeding clockwise sat Mizuha, Yuika, Koharu, Shouma, and Mao. The two couples were seated together, with Yuika and Mao between the two of them. Despite it being a weekday, they all were wearing casual clothes. The reason for this was because the food had to be prepared, so they went home separately and then grouped up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, to Nanjou's serialization in the monthly magazine-Cheers!" "Cheers!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki acted as the representative for the group, starting up the party with a</p>
<p class="null-p">brief introduction. After that, the other couple and Yuika gave their blessings. "Nanjou-san, congratulations on the serialization."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Congrats, Mao-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will definitely buy the manga volume if it comes out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you." Mao bashfully conveyed her gratitude, and then dropped her gaze down to the table. "So… who's going to eat all of this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha really got into it, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just so happy for Mao-chan that I couldn't help myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, just as Mao had stated, it was dubious whether or not they could eat all of this food. Roasted chicken, naporitan, hamburger steak, and fried potatoes… When they told Mizuha about the serialization, she was so excited that she came up with the idea of throwing a party to celebrate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a shame that Sayuki-senpai couldn't come, though." "She had other plans already, right? Couldn't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Sayuki was a passionate fan of Mao's doujinshi, even owning physical copies of all her works, she naturally was very delighted to hear about the serialization. But at the same time, she was frustrated that she couldn't be there for the party.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, that sure surprised me yesterday. I've rarely seen you that flustered, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shut up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not teasing you, I was just reminded of how happy you were." "Of course. This is what I've always been working towards."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad you managed to achieve your dream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah." Mao nodded and took a sip from the cup of orange juice. "This really is amazing. Yuika knows this magazine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, the reception on my second one-shot was pretty good, so during a survey, there were a lot of people who wanted to read a continuation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've read it myself, but it was very entertaining."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really put my all into it. But I didn't make it in time for my manuscript last month, and I even hurt my hand… It's thanks to Kiryuu gathering helpers that I managed to pull it off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you said that Keiki-senpai worked really hard for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I introduced some friends to her. They're the people from the manga research club, so I didn't do much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had only thought of somebody who could help, so he introduced them. In the end, the best he could do was provide energy drinks until they were done.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But now you'll have to finish a chapter every month, right?" "That's what it boils down to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will you be fine doing that on your own? I'd imagine the workload will be pretty extreme."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No worries. The people from the manga research club are part of the team. Inooka-senpai also offered to help despite having graduated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a relief, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">The people from the manga research club were the fresh graduate Inooka- senpai, the glasses-wearing boy Shikagawa-kun, and the shy Chouno. When Mao ended up injuring her hand, they joined her on the battlefield. They'll surely be a great help for the upcoming serialization.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since the manuscript will be done digitally, all of us can work on it at home. Since it's a proper job, I plan on paying them, and Inooka-senpai was happy that he had found himself a part-time job. He wants to buy anime goods or blu-rays with his share."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's got his money management down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it becomes popular and gets turned into an anime, make sure to invite us out onto some yakiniku." Yuika said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit early to think about that. It's not quite that simple."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that conversation going on in the background, the party continued. Mizuha's cooking was as delicious as always, and since almost all the club members were present, they never ran out of topics to talk about, making for an enjoyable time. What felt the most impactful was that the usually cool Mao even joined in with smiles of her own. Since Keiki was always close by, he knew how hard she had worked. Now that her hard work had started to pay off, he felt as happy as if it had happened to him. At the same time, he felt thankful to his little sister for coming up with the idea of the party. He was glad that they had decided to do this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Two hours of joy and fun passed. Most of the food vanished into the participating members' bellies, and as it had started to get late, they decided to disband for the day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's gotten pretty dark outside, so I'll see you off, Koga-san." "Err, going home with a lolicon is a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Shouma was a nice guy, deep down he was a lolicon, so Yuika had all the reason to be wary, but letting her go home alone wasn't an option either, so Koharu provided a follow-up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, I'll be going with you." "Then it should be fine," Yuika nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even without Koharu-chan, I will guarantee your safety. My personal value</p>
<p class="null-p">is 'Yes Lolita ‐ No Touch' after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The second you have to remind yourself of that, you're definitely a dangerous person. Also Yuika isn't a loli." She added.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika and Koharu were left in Shouma's care, so they should be fine. "Then Nii-san should send Mao-chan home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right, it'd be safer that way." "I'd be fine on my own, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so Mao said, but as you would expect…</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do. It's dangerous to let a girl walk home alone this late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right, you never know when a pervert who's into red-hairs might appear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I highly doubt such a pervert exists…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, Mao saw no point further arguing against the siblings. "Then, escort me home…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, with pleasure."</p>
<p class="null-p">As everything wrapped up, they prepared to head home. Just to make sure, they checked if they had forgotten anything, but once that was done, they each put on their coats and left the house in Mizuha's care. They walked together until the nearest pedestrian crossing, and then the two groups split up, which left Keiki with just Mao. She was wearing slim denim jeans along with a trendy coat to keep herself warm while also blessing her with a mature look. Once their eyes met, she showed a joyful smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's gotten so quiet now, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because we were in a large group up until now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha's cooking was as delicious as always, and talking with everyone was fun, but it felt like my last supper. Once I get home, I have to start work on the storyboard, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess being a mangaka is tough work, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll probably be really busy from now on. I have to work on my manuscript every month, while also continuing my shortcake series. It's made me realize that there are too many things to do and nearly not enough time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that you still have to attend school." "The struggles of a student, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Balancing studies and work… Being a student and mangaka at the same time must be hard work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'll still show up for my club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure? Don't have to force yourself if you're that busy." "I'm not forcing myself. I want to stay in the calligraphy club." "…I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt relieved to hear that. He felt the same way when it came to Sayuki, but losing members would be a sad thing to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Change of subject, but are you fine with this?" Mao asked. "You're seeing a girl off while you have a cute girlfriend waiting at home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, she's the one who suggested it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so, normally she wouldn't let her boyfriend send home her rival in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pffft?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only then did Keiki realize it. Since Mao had confessed to Keiki in the past,</p>
<p class="null-p">it technically made her a rival to Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would never leave my rival alone with my boyfriend. She must have a lot of trust in you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Trust for what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That you don't go around playing with another girl while she's not looking. Seriously, how did you manage to make her fall for you this much? You're a natural-born player, let me tell you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that, I have no recollection of it whatsoever…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I said 'natural-born'." Keiki's classmate's sharp gaze tore right through him. "Well, after everything you've done for Mizuha, I guess that makes sense. To the point I get jealous just watching you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was panicking a bit back then, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were talking about the time the rumors went around at school. Back then, all Keiki wanted was for the girl he liked to smile again. In order to resolve that problem, Keiki chose the path of making her his fiancee. It was forceful, and maybe not the best method, but he had no regrets.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha's happy, you know. Every day is like a dream for her. She's loved by Kiryuu and everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She said that?" "You're loved, huh?" "…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Kiryuu's blushing~!" "Hey, what even is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Some new type of humiliation? Keiki felt awkward and ticklish all over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you just keep going like that. I'll make sure to observe you two." "Huh? Observe? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, the model for the heroine in 'IkeSuki1' is you, Kiryuu, so if you're not living out your romcom life, I won't be getting any material."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You… you plan on using me as the basis for your manga?" "I have high hopes for you~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh lord…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't think the former Prez and Yuika have any intention of giving up on you, so some steamy afternoon drama-style development would probably be the best thing for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What expectations do you have of me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oops, we're here already." Mao stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were so lost in conversation that they had arrived at her home in no time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for taking me home." "You're welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, one last thing." "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, could you turn around?" "Huh? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, just do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say so…" Keiki reluctantly turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after, he felt a gentle impact hitting his back. By the time he realized that the softness pressing against him were a girl's breasts, it all came together that Mao was hugging him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on, what kind of situation is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a gentle hug with her arms wrapped around his waist. It resembled something like a lovers' hug. Keiki's only duty was to send off his classmate, and yet this mess of a situation happened. Did Nanjou-san actually plan on this from the very start?</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Thanks for everything." "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, both for today and everything else so far. You keep saying that you didn't do much, but the reason I made it this far is because of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">From behind his back, Keiki received genuine words of gratitude.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_14_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"…Also, Kiryuu?" "W-What now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doing this in front of my home at night makes it feel like you're cheating, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get away from me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, Kiryuu got angry at me." Mao laughed gleefully as she moved away from Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her home behind her back, the girl turned around to face Keiki. "I'm glad I fell in love with you, Kiryuu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"See you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She left behind these bewildering words, turned her back towards him, and started running inside. Once she had completely vanished, Keiki also turned around to walk away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Do your best, Minami-sensei."</p>
<p class="null-p">She'll surely be a great creator some day. Surprising people, moving people, and then becoming a renowned mangaka. As a single fan who had always been by her side, Keiki already looked forward to reading her work.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After the end-of-term exams, the end-of-term ceremony arrived, announcing the beginning of spring break. While the school was preparing to welcome the new students, and the current students were taking a break, Keiki was enjoying his time together with Mizuha as always. With no homework to do, they spent the time cleaning the house, watching movies, shopping for new clothes, and thoroughly indulging in their break overall.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then on an April morning, Mizuha and Keiki put on their cleaned uniforms and made their way to school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spring break passed in the blink of an eye, huh." "It was only a week, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon arriving at the school, they first headed for the shoe lockers. With the change of years and the beginning of a new term, what the students were most excited about was the change of classes. Despite the two of them having left the house early, the new class compositions hanging up on a board next to the front entrance were barely visible because of all the people around them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm in class C. I guess we're still in different classes this year, Nii-san." "Class B here. Well, we're siblings, so that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Up to this point, Mizuha and Keiki had never been in the same class before. Since their surnames were the same, the school probably didn't want them to end up in the same class.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, Nii-san, big news." "What's up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-chan and Shouma-kun are in my class." "What did you say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's gaze reflexively shot towards the list of class C, spotting the names 'Akiyama Shouma' and 'Nanjou Mao'. Realizing that he would be separated from the friends he had been in the same class with for the past two years, a cold sweat ran down his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… Am I going to end up in a class with nobody I know…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As this was the final stretch in his high school life, that would be a fate all too cruel. And to speak of the devil, Shouma and Mao arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sup!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning, Mao-chan, Shouma-kun." "Morning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After they finished their greetings, Mao narrowed one eye at Keiki's listless response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why're you so down today, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is sad that he's not in the same class as you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh? Are you that sad to be separated from us, Kiryuu?" Nanjou-san flashed a teasing grin. "Lonely lonely boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Shouma tapped Keiki on the shoulder. "So we're… finally separated…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, stop that. Nanjou's giving us a rotten gaze already."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had taken out her smartphone and had started taking pictures. After that photoshoot was done, she stuffed away her smartphone and started talking to Mizuha like nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So we're in the same class this year, huh?" "Yup, I'm looking forward to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, even Megumi is in class C." Mao commented. "Wha?! So not even Onizuka-san is with me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With this, the former class B friend group had completely fallen apart, signaling the beginning of the 'Loner Keiki-kun Legend'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it… isn't there anybody I know in there…?" He looked through the name register once more, looking for a comrade with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, he spotted a familiar name. "-Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that odd timing, Keiki heard his name being called, and when he turned around, he spotted a familiar girl about the same height as Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto…san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Keiki wasn't entirely sure was because the girl had changed quite a bit from before. The one eye that was usually hidden by her bangs now directly looked at Keiki like it was no big deal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're in the same class this year, huh." She said and smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who had her bangs put up with a hair pin was a new Fujimoto Ayano.</p>
Ike from Ikemen = Hottie/Handsome</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: Would You Be Able To Like A Pervert If They're Cute?</p>
<p class="null-p">In the classroom of class 3-B, Keiki sat on his new seat, located on the window side in the last row, one seat between him and the window. He received this seat during the seat lottery that happened during morning homeroom. It was a great seat to have, so when he cleaned up his physics workbook from the fourth period with a clear mind, he called out to the classmate sitting next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm surprised we ended up in the same class, Fujimoto-san." "Yeah, I was just as surprised."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who responded with a gentle voice was Keiki's new classmate Fujimoto Ayano. She, the student council president, managed to snag the best possible seat, namely the furthest back on the window side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that we're seat neighbors. That's a pretty impressive coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I can always recharge whenever I want, I'm perfectly happy with this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't plan on providing anything, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he didn't do anything, his scent naturally drifted around in the air near him. During class, he could hear some heavy breathing from the seat next to him, but he decided to ignore it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad you're here, though, Fujimoto-san. I was worried since Shouma and practically everybody else ended up in a different class from me. I would</p>
<p class="null-p">have been sad if I had no friends in my new class."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he didn't expect the two of them to sit next to each other, he was lucky to have Ayano around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy that we're in the same class." "Because you can recharge whenever you want?" "Not just your scent. I like Kiryuu-kun." "Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're an important friend, Kiryuu-kun." "A-Ahh… that's what you mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki almost suffered from a really bad misunderstanding. Unbeknownst to that, however, Ayano started to awkwardly glance around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like a lot of people are looking at me today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because of your sudden image change, Fujimoto-san." "Image change?" Ayano-san seemed a bit bewildered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her two eyes, no longer hidden by her bangs, looked at Keiki in confusion. "I mean, you put up your bangs with a hairpin today, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone is probably surprised to see both of your eyes." "Ah…?!" She made a shriek and pressed her hands to her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, her face turned as red as a tomato, and she looked up at Keiki. "I was wondering why my view was so broad today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So… it wasn't an image change?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't have much time this morning, so I forgot to take it off after washing my face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, with how long your hair is, I bet it'll get in the way."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why she put her bangs up with a hairpin and came to school like that. "I guess Fujimoto-san can be clumsy from time to time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How embarrassing…"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_14_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">This time, she covered her entire face with her hands. Even her earlobes were red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go fix my hair really quick." She said and stood up from her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was probably planning on fixing her hair before eating lunch. However, presumably because she panicked a bit too much, the second she attempted to move from her chair, her foot got caught in the leg of her desk and she fell over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaa?!" "Careful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While sitting on the chair, Keiki embraced Ayano's body in an attempt to stop her from falling. Luckily he was turning towards Ayano, making for an easier catch. Sighing in relief that she was safe, he called out to the girl in his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah… I'm sorry…" "It's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since that made a loud sound, the other classmates around directed their attention at the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"President, are you okay?" "Are you hurt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano waved her hand, reassuring them that she was fine, and they returned to their lunch or conversations. Some of the boys made jealous gazes directed towards Keiki, but as this was a genuine accident, they didn't say any more than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you stand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Ayano moved her body to stand up, she seemed to feel something and looked at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, it's nothing. I'll go fix my hair." Ayano answered and quickly left the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that about? Her face looked oddly serious there…" Maybe he had some bed hair on his head?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, whatever."</p>
<p class="null-p">That in itself was a question he would leave unanswered, but since Keiki felt hungry now, he instead directed his attention towards Mizuha's homemade lunch box full of love.</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, after Keiki finished washing his body, barely having sat down in the bathtub, his little sister barged into the bathroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for the intrusion~" "Huh? Wha, Mizuha-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, since this was inside the bathroom, both of them were completely naked. Mizuha hid the bare minimum with a towel in her hand, but she didn't achieve much with that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm still in the middle of taking a bath, you know? Why are you just storming in like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you not want me to be here?" "I mean, it's not like I mind, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no reason to be embarrassed after everything we've done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you should develop your sense of shame some more."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected of an exibitionist, she paid no heed to the fact that her older brother could see her naked. She simply waltzed through the room like a queen on the way to her throne. After that, she threw a glance at her boyfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you wash my hair?" She asked with a sweet voice. "Yeah, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being relied on made Keiki happy, of course, and washing her hair might make them seem even closer as lovers. With that thought in mind, he stepped out of the bathtub and walked behind Mizuha. He sprayed water on her hair with the showerhead, and grabbed the bottle of shampoo. He filled his hands with lots of the pleasant-smelling liquid and gently started rubbing Mizuha's head with it. Feeling good, the girl let out a faint sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is this, dear customer?" "It feels great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that." Keiki continued with the head massage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to a boy's, her hair was a lot softer. Even though her hair strands were the same, they felt as smooth as silk as they went between Keiki's fingers. Although his customer was currently naked in front of him, nothing felt too out of the ordinary since they had been doing this countless times since they were young.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, what's your new class like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's so-so, I guess. I spotted some people from my previous class, but the only person I can really talk with is Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It must be nice for you to have Shouma and Nanjou in the same class."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're practically the next class over, so you can eat lunch with us, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a great idea-Alright, I'm rinsing it off~" Keiki said, picking up the showerhead to rinse the shampoo off Mizuha's hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, he used a small towel to dry her hair a bit. "Alright, we're done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks." "No biggie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then next up is my body, please." "I think you can do that yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Washing her body was way too much. It'd just ruin his sense of reason. "Then another time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Another time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl seemed somewhat displeased and began washing her body on her own. Starting with her beautiful arms, she moved on to her shoulders and cleavage, followed by her armpits and stomach, until she moved through her entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">So Mizuha starts with her arms, huh…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to watch any more, Keiki averted his gaze and returned to the bathtub, lowering his shoulders into the water. Shortly afterwards, Mizuha rinsed off her body once more and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I join you, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This bathtub is a bit too narrow for that, though, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, it's fine." Mizuha ignored his comment with a smile and entered the bathtub herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki made some space for her, which made them sit facing each other. With the water rising as she entered, it thankfully managed to cover most of Mizuha, but even the cleavage shown from the water and her bare shoulders were stimulating enough. And as expected, an average family's bathtub was too narrow for the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe this was a bad idea…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then would this be better?" Mizuha asked and slipped between her older brother's legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, she leaned her back against him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've always wanted to do this." She said and looked at Keiki. "How's this?" "Not bad. It feels like we're an actual couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't hurt to do something sweet once in a while." "But you're always like this, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">When they were sitting on the sofa, she would always snuggle up to him. If they were reading books in the room, she would sometimes embrace him from behind. Even when laying next to each other in bed, she would look at him, brimming with desire for a pleasant head rub.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you hate a sweet and clingy girlfriend like me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love her to bits." Keiki conveyed his love, embracing the girl from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">As with every single day after they started dating, they were lovey-dovey to the utmost.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">A few days passed after that, and an average weekday morning arrived. Keiki</p>
<p class="null-p">entered the classroom, making his way to his seat, and Ayano arrived shortly after.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, good morning Fujimoto… san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki turned his head towards the girl, only for a question mark to appear above his head because of her appearance. Namely, it was because Ayano was wearing a mask. It wasn't actually a full-face mask, but rather an orthodox type that covered her mouth and nose. Without any particular comment, the girl moved to her seat and put down her bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, do you have a cold?" "Nope, I'm feeling just fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Then why are you wearing that mask?" "That's… um… b-because it's in fashion right now…?" "Fashion?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing a mask despite being healthy was a trend that girls were doing recently?</p>
<p class="null-p">But she's the first girl I see with a mask at school…</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, because of the mask and her long bangs, her face was practically hidden completely. It was a shame that her beautiful facial features were covered completely, only offering a view of one eye as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because of personal reasons, I shall answer no more questions." "Damn, what a boring interview."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is more important than my three sizes after all." "It's that big of a deal, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving aside the fact that Keiki's genuine interest in these three sizes was way greater than the case with the mask, he realized that prying any further wouldn't do him any good.</p>
<p class="null-p">What would you wear a mask for if not a cold…?</p>
<p class="null-p">There was still a bit more time until the first homeroom, so Keiki thought about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It doesn't seem to be hay fever at least… Maybe she's got a pimple on her face?</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering that she was an adolescent girl, that sort of problem might drive her to wear a mask. At the very least, it would explain why she didn't want to talk about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it looks like she's breathing heavily for some reason…</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no mistaking it. It was the exasperated sigh of a maiden in distress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ruining Fujimoto-san's beautiful skin… Curse you, damn pimple!</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki had lived together with his sister for several years, he was quite familiar with how girls his age thought. If a girl said to not meddle any further, then silence was the best treatment. If he started bothering her more, it'd only ruin her mood. Skincare problems were just one possibility. If so, Keiki already knew the stance he had to take.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Until the pimple's gone, I'll just leave her alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">A few more days passed since then, and we reach the lunch break on Monday. Keiki visited the class next door, enjoying lunch with his friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Class C really is so calm. It makes me feel right at home." "I totally get it. Without Keiki around, I'm going crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can keep eating here with us, then. It'll allow me to get some juicy BL material."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy if Nii-san is with me as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Let alone Shouma and Mao, now even Mizuha was welcoming Keiki with that adorable statement. However, everybody around must have gotten used to it by now, as no side comments were directed their way. As Keiki was thinking that while enjoying lunch with his girlfriend, Shouma finished eating his sweet bread and opened his mouth while waving a pack of milk he was holding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, I heard something from Koharu-chan. Tokihara-senpai's gotten pretty popular at university. 'Large-scale newcomer' they call her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Large-scale… are they talking about her chest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"With her beauty and perfect style, there's a lot of guys gunning for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai looks like the peaceful type of beauty as long as she keeps her mouth shut."</p>
<p class="null-p">In that way, she's a friendly woman who's easy to get along with. Keiki himself was used to her, so he knew her charms more than anybody else. She might look perfect, but her secret fetish was more dangerous than anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just hope these guys don't figure out her fetish."</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd cause a huge ruckus if people found out she was a masochist, and it might just ruin her new campus life. While Keiki found himself praying for her not to be found out, Mao stopped eating for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, she hasn't shown her face at the club for a hot minute, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She must be busy as a new university student. I'm sure she'll show up once things have calmed down."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the kind of person she was. She'd surely show up the instant she felt lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of not showing your face, Fujimoto-san is still wearing her mask, huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">While poking his chopsticks into the food, Keiki once again thought about Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said she was going to eat in the student council office, but I guess she still doesn't want me to see her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">They ate lunch together for the first few days, but after she put the mask on, she kept eating at a separate location. They were actually talking, so she wasn't particularly avoiding him either. Rather, she probably didn't want to take the mask off in front of other people.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's been quite some time as well… was the pimple that bad…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she had gotten cursed by a real tenacious bastard of a pimple.</p>
<p class="null-p">She seems a bit down because of it, so I'd like to do something about it…</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if it really was skincare problems, then there was nothing for Keiki to do. Since she was a girl, Ayano surely knew more about that, and she said to not bother her any further about it, so meddling was out of the question. If only there was another way of caring for her unrelated to that…</p>
<p class="null-p">There's really only one thing that would make her happy, huh…?</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd be a surefire way to make Ayano cheer up. They'd known each other for almost a year now, so Keiki wanted to make her happy. In return, it would require him to suppress his own shame, but it was an easy price if he could make the girl smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki made up his mind, and went to prepare his plan after eating lunch.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes, Keiki waited for homeroom to end and then proceeded to execute his plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, do you have a moment?" "Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki called out to the masked girl who was packing her bag. Since people were still present in the classroom, he instead called her outside of the classroom, to an empty room nearby. After confirming that nobody was around, Keiki took out the goods.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted you to have this, Fujimoto-san." "Is that… a t-shirt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not just any t-shirt. It's a special Kiryuu Keiki-worn t-shirt. You seemed a bit down lately, so I thought that maybe you needed to recharge."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recharge…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry, I won't give you any half-baked goods. Since we didn't have any P.E. class today, I did some light muscle training in the clubroom during lunch break so that it would pack some punch."</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly speaking, Keiki himself wasn't quite sure what he was even saying anymore, but he was just desperate to get across how special it was. This t- shirt quite literally was the result of sweat and tears. It probably gave off an immense stench. To the smell fetishist Ayano, this should be a treasure, to say the least. Keiki may not be wearing anything under his uniform right now, but it was a small price to pay for this precious friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Fujimoto-san, no need to hold back! Enjoy it!" Keiki offered it to the girl with full confidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the answer from the perverted student council wasn't like anything he had anticipated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I don't need it." "…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano averted her gaze and attempted to quickly leave the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on! It's drenched with my sweat, you know! Do you really not want it?!" Keiki desperately tried to stop her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was as much of a pervert as Ayano at that point, but he couldn't step down anymore. Ayano stopped in her tracks, and answered with a dull voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy, but… I'm done with that sort of thing." She declined Keiki's present, and quickly walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was left behind, shirt in hand, trying to understand what had just happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san turned down my t-shirt…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unbelievable. Keiki knew that she was always desperate for anything related to his scent, so she would never turn down his sweaty t-shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is serious now."</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day after the situation drastically changed, the final period turned out to be P.E., which was currently taking place. Keiki had changed into his jersey, standing against the wall of the gym hall since he had finished his match, and tried to fight the sleepiness as he waited for his next turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, his eyes weren't drifting towards the boys playing basketball, but the girls gracefully playing volleyball. The girls of class 3-B were all fairly skilled. Of course, all the other boys currently on stand-by were looking at the girls as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amidst that however, Keiki's gaze was especially fixated on Ayano. And Keiki wasn't enjoying the shaking breasts as much as the other boys. It wasn't as if Ayano-san had nothing to shake, but Keiki was genuinely worried about her as a friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if Fujimoto-san is okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was still wearing her mask as she participated in a volleyball match. She probably didn't want to show her skin since she was plagued by acne, but doing sports with a mask on must make it hard for her to breathe. That being said, telling her to take off the mask wasn't an option either. At the same</p>
<p class="null-p">time, Keiki had already failed to help the girl cheer up. Unable to do anything, only watching the girl from a distance, Keiki let out a defeated sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when he realized how powerless he was, something happened. A shriek could be heard. Keiki raised his head and spotted a group of girls standing around. And then, he saw the girl who had collapsed in the center of the crowd.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The second he realized that the girl who had collapsed was Fujimoto Ayano, Keiki was already running towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around an hour passed after that, and now he was in the infirmary after classes had ended. Keiki had changed from his gym clothes into his regular uniform and was playing on his smartphone when Ayano opened her eyes from her position on the infirmary bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, are you finally awake?" "…Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The eye not hidden by her bangs looked at Keiki. She still seemed a bit out of it. She clumsily pushed herself upright.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The infirmary. You collapsed during P.E." "Collapsed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because you kept your mask on, you weren't able to breathe properly, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…" Ayano put her hand to her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, the mask had been taken off her a while back.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, she didn't have any pimples anywhere…</p>
<p class="null-p">When they took off Ayano's mask, it revealed her face, beautiful as always. From the looks of it, she wasn't trying to hide any impurities on her skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">But then why did she…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki could ask Ayano for her reasons, she put her nose closer to her arm, sniffing it. At this point in time, she was still wearing the jersey from</p>
<p class="null-p">P.E class.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is Kiryuu-kun's scent…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was the one who carried you here, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, the health representative of class 3-B was a girl, so she alone wouldn't have been able to carry Ayano, which was why Keiki offered to help, as he personally knew her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had homeroom, so I went back to change into my uniform, but Tachibana- sensei said that she had a meeting, so here I am."</p>
<p class="null-p">Figuring that Ayano would probably be lonely waking up with nobody around, he had waited for her to wake up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for troubling you like that…" "You didn't trouble me at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it… I did something bad to Kiryuu-san…" "Huh? To Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…" Ayano suddenly started blushing.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the bed, she started fidgeting awkwardly. And then, she responded in a quiet and awkward tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lately, Kiryuu-kun has been smelling a lot like Kiryuu-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You two live together, so I could pick it up from time to time, but… ever since you started dating, I could really start to notice…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So do you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano could smell whenever Keiki and Mizuha came to school after a passionate evening? After they started dating, they'd been even closer at home, even embracing each other in the bath. Naturally, their scents would start to mix.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but don't worry, I think I'm the only one who can notice." "I-I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, what kind of weird skill was this even?</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're dating, so it's normal that you've gotten closer." "Yeah, I guess so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that's why I would feel bad recharging off of Kiryuu-kun…" "Feel bad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You and Kiryuu-san are dating, so I assumed that sniffing you and recharging would be bad manners."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? So the reason you were wearing the mask was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been trying not to sniff too much of Kiryuu-kun's scent, thinking that Kiryuu-san probably wouldn't like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I actually really wanted that special-made t-shirt of yours." "R-Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't sure if he should feel happy about that or not. But even so, he at least understood the reason why she had been acting odd like that. It was to not make Mizuha feel bad or jealous about another girl sniffing her boyfriend's scent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think you need to worry about that, you know?" "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha probably wouldn't get angry from something minor like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even right now as they were dating, Keiki had been treated as a slave by Yuika, and turned into BL material for Mao's work, and yet Mizuha showed no attempts at stopping either of them. If he cared about everything the perverts around you did, he would have no rest at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that I'm showering Mizuha with lots of love so that she doesn't end up worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooohh…" Ayano raised her voice in admiration.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even she seemed embarrassed by the thought, as she blushed in response. "That being the case, you can sniff me as much as you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Anywhere and anytime?" "Well, maybe not my underwear." "Then… I'd like to sniff your armpit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a lot more maniacal than I thought!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The armpits of all places. Not to mention right after P.E. class.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never thought I would feel hesitant about a place other than my underwear…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought he had become an expert when it came to smell fetishists, but</p>
<p class="null-p">another door had just opened to him. "Is that… no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urgh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't sure what to say in the face of Ayano's plea. He was embarrassed, but since he already said he would be fine with it, he figured he'd go ahead and allow her to do it. He wouldn't be able to fight against the girl's adorable begging face either way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took off his upper clothes except for his t-shirt and raised his arm, pointing it at the girl. Since he usually didn't do this, he felt quite embarrassed. Ayano audibly gulped, put both her hands on the bed, and moved her body closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, if you would excuse me…" She approached Keiki's defenseless armpit with her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniff… sniff… Sniff… Haaaaaa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano took a few deep breaths, and her face melted. She was quite clearly in a trance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, amazing… after holding back this entire time… I'm glad to be alive." "Is it that good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano made it sound like she had found an oasis in the middle of a desert. At least she had recovered from her slump. But then the door to the infirmary suddenly opened, and a single female student stepped inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, I heard Fujimoto-san collapsed. Is she okay?" "Mizuha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's honey walked into the infirmary at the worst possible time. Because</p>
<p class="null-p">he didn't expect things to escalate like this, he totally forgot about the message titled 'I'm watching over the collapsed Fujimoto-san in the infirmary' that he had sent to Mizuha. Witnessing this abnormal scene in front of her, Mizuha stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?" She blinked in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her beloved older brother was currently having his armpit sniffed by Ayano. "Nii-san is forcing Fujimoto-san to sniff his armpit?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you kidding me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't even think of that interpretation. Then again, this entire situation was just an entire mess and a half, so Keiki had to work his hardest to ensure his little sister wouldn't categorize him as a pervert now.</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, after the misunderstanding had been resolved, the siblings finished their dinner, sitting on the living room sofa just passing some time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess Fujimoto-san really wanted to take in someone's scent, huh?" "I sort of get where she's coming from."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, you also sniffed my clothes before, huh?" "I really wish you could forget about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was when Keiki was working as a temporary student council member. Keiki suddenly heard sounds from the changing room in his house despite it being awfully late, only to find his little sister sunken to the ground, sniffing his shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, she said she felt happy at being able to pick up my scent…</p>
<p class="null-p">She said something along the lines of feeling happy because it was as if he was hugging her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me for a moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">He moved closer towards Mizuha, burying his face into her chest. After that, he took in a few deep breaths.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been thinking about this from time to time, but you smell really nice, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? R-Really…"? Mizuha seemed happy at that praise, blushing ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It gave off a gentle scent that calmed Keiki from the bottom of his heart. Her softness and the warmth she emitted made him want to stay like that forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How long will you stay like that, Nii-san?" "Just a bit longer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sheesh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha sighed, yet she seemed happy as she gently caressed Keiki's head like he was a small child.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, this is so relaxing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Enwrapped in a sweet scent, he felt his heart melting away in joy. He feared that this might just become a habit.</p>
<p class="null-p">I might have a smell fetish that's limited to Mizuha…</p>
<p class="null-p">For the first time, Keiki understood Ayano and Mizuha's desire to smell someone of the opposite sex. After all, it was hard to move away from this warmth he was surrounded by. He decided to be spoiled by this just a bit longer, enjoying the scent of his beloved girlfriend to its fullest.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, we got no new club members, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Close to the end of April, on an average afternoon once classes had ended, all club members of the calligraphy club had gathered, when Keiki brought up that topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We did hang up application posters, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The calligraphy club was never really that popular, I guess." "At first, it was just you and Tokihara-senpai after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, Mao, and Mizuha all gave their own comments on the situation. It'd been about a month since the new year began. In other words, the new students had an entire month to start fitting in, and yet not a single applicant had shown up. And that was the current situation of the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we can't force people to join, so maybe we should just give up." "That is true."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had to agree to Mao's comment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But with no new club members, Yuika will end up all alone once all of you graduate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the club might get abolished."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We just have to think about that next year. Don't worry, Yuika won't let them abolish the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, how reliable." Mao rubbed Yuika's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Yuika always got along with Mao, she happily narrowed her eyes. "I have to say, when you look at her like this, Yuika really is a beauty." "W-Where did that come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was bewildered at Mao's praise that virtually came out of nowhere, but Mizuha continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really popular with the first-years, Yuika-chan. They say that there's a cute senior who is part of the library committee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's why there was such a storm of people at one point." "It's not like the library room getting crowded is a good thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after becoming a second-year, Yuika's popularity as the 'Angel of the Library Room' only increased. A lot of seniors gathered in hopes of getting closer to that angel, which is why a lot more books were borrowed and returned especially during her shifts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe we'll get some new club members if you promise them a kiss on the cheek, Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No thank you. Yuika doesn't plan on becoming a tourist attraction." Yuika pouted in a cute way.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was so cute that Mizuha quickly took a picture. As all the third-years were busy doting on the girl, a knock was heard from the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, come on in~" "Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving permission to enter, the door opened with Airi stepping inside. "Oh, Nagase-san?" Keiki greeted her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work today, everyone." "What brings you here today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My work brought me to the clubroom building, so I figured I might as well stop by. I was worried that you might turn the calligraphy club into a bunny girl host club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There will never be a bunny girl party again, so don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that the entire idea of it was a rare thing, to begin with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And to be perfectly honest, Mitani is in the student council office right now, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, has he still not given up yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? What's going on between Airi and Mitani?" Mao must have been curious about that, as she joined the conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, Rintarou's been oddly fixated on Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't want anything to do with that person, though. He's so persistent…" Airi muttered, sounding exhausted.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was always mature and calm, so the always-energetic, always-excited Rintarou must be making her feel hard-pressed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it surprises me that Rintarou still hasn't given up.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did say that he didn't care about breasts anymore, so maybe his feelings might be genuine. The problem was that his interest this time gave him no chance at all…</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I wanted to date someone, it would have to be a more sincere person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi is a diligent person with a great mindset after all." Yuika chimed in, presumably having heard the circumstances prior.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, you two were in the same class this year, right?" Keiki commented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, Airi was even crying because of that." "Yuika?! You promised not to tell anybody, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Every single thing I hear from Nagase-san is so adorable."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both her affection for Yuika, her skill at looking after others, and even the gap between her cold shell and soft insides. Blushing at being exposed, Airi cleared her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than me, shouldn't you worry about your club's work for the contest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Contest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, you still haven't finished it? The deadline for the contest is right around the corner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… now that you mention it, Okita-sensei told me something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they barely entered April Okita-sensei called Keiki over to inform him of that. Since there would be a contest at the end of the month, he and the club would have to prepare something. Last year, Sayuki's work 'Evil Spirits of Rivers and Mountains' won said contest.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to create this product, Sayuki completely messed up the room, which led to the huge cleaning operation on the day when Cinderella's panties were found-but that's not important right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, can't you tell us about that sooner?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right, Keiki-senpai, we're all involved in this." "My apologies."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of everything that had happened related to Ayano, he had completely forgotten.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For crying out loud, Kiryuu-senpai… Yuika isn't telling you to win the prize, but at least turn something in. Otherwise, the club might suffer from that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The club's budget being cut would be an easy punishment, but the</p>
<p class="null-p">abolishment of the club would be no laughing matter. If that happened, Keiki wouldn't be able to look Sayuki in the eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess we have to pull an all-nighter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not studying for an exam. Even if you started now, you'd have to close up soon because the school closes, so just work on it tomorrow. As long as you finish it before the deadline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected of the reliable Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, they still had a bit of time left until the deadline. They should prepare everything and work on it tomorrow. Like this, the club's next activities were reluctantly decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright everyone, today the four of us will create a piece for the contest… so the bare minimum is to get at least one done!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaaaaay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, the calligraphy club's clubroom turned into a battlefield. The four members were fighting the approaching deadline. The deadline Teacher Okita gave was tomorrow, but considering the time frame, they had to finish it today. As things would be too close after classes, the president gathered everyone as quickly as possible. The large working space this time was the tatami space. Two large papers filled the table, and Yuika and Mao were working on them. Since not much space was available, the Kiryuu siblings moved towards the normal table with calligraphy paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'm done!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?! Mao-senpai, so fast!" "Isn't that a bit too fast?" "Let me see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Around ten minutes after their work began, Cpt. Nanjou raised a confident voice and gathered the other club members, who looked at her work. Written on the large paper on the tatami space was 'Naked Body-Only! A Manly Poking At Each Other!'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The atmosphere in the clubroom immediately turned subzero. "Heh, how's this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know what to say…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Firstly, Keiki wished she would do something about this awkward mood. "Mao-senpai, Yuika thinks this is a bit too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I second that." Mizuha nodded. "Really? I think I did a pretty good job." "Yeah, the quality itself is well done."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected of Mao's artistic talent, her letters were written beautifully and easy to read. That is why the choice of words just ruined everything about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, maybe we should leave out any BL-related stuff. As well as any other taboo words. If our work caused another problem, the club might actually get abolished now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what were you thinking of writing, Kiryuu?" "'World Peace', I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? That's so average that it's kinda boring." "Well excuse me, princess. I like to play it safe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides being a siscon, Keiki was a perfectly normal being. He did not wish</p>
<p class="null-p">for any sort of naked people poking at each other. "Then Yuika will choose 'Stealing One's Partner'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might go with 'First To Strike Wins', I guess." Mao added.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like your choices have a deeper meaning that I don't want to figure out…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was most likely an attempt at troubling Keiki. "So what were you thinking of writing, Mizuha?" "I thought of writing 'Family Safety'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both the Kiryuu peeps are going with the boring choices like a married couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thinks you lack a sense of humor." "You two really don't hold back at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, they were taking their work seriously. According to Yuika, this might lead to more people joining the club, so Keiki felt happy to see his junior's growth. Work continued in this manner, and after around an hour passed, a certain person entered the room without knocking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Oh my, this has turned more into a calligraphy club than when I was here."</p>
<p class="null-p">A black-haired upperclassman appeared, followed by everybody turning towards the girl. She was wearing a classic and youthful one-piece with a jacket, her hair tied up into a ponytail with a white scrunchie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, here I am." The university student Tokihara Sayuki responded with a bashful tone, flashing a wink. "I thought the deadline for the contest was coming up soon, and it seems like I was correct. Rest assured, because I am</p>
<p class="null-p">here now. I'll train all of you so that you will win the first prize for sure!" "Ah, it's fine, we just finished."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?!" Sayuki let out a bewildered and perturbed voice. Just as Keiki said, most members had just finished their work.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_14_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai, you're late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I would have had you draw mine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey now, that's against the rules." Keiki complained to Yuika and Mao. "Nii-san, Tokihara-senpai seems depressed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?" Keiki looked over at his senior, only to find her crouching down on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was my perfect chance to be popular with all my juniors, and yet…" "You wanted attention that badly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was as childish as always. She was probably lonely because quite some time had passed since she had graduated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted Keiki-kun to praise me a lot, so I was ready to work really hard… I even got my hopes up that he might make me his pet, so I brought my collar with me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on, where did you even take that out from?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In her hand, she was holding a familiar red collar, like it was a snack she was going to eat later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I have to say, with the way the room is an absolute mess right now, I feel an odd sense of deja-vu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence. I feel the same way."</p>
<p class="null-p">After putting away the collar, the girl looked around the room. A large quantity of paper was scattered everywhere, and ink splattered all over the place. The calligraphy paper and newspaper copies covered the ground so much that it was hard to see the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've finished our work, so it's time to put everything back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Keiki-kun, are you about to clean the room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. If I leave things the way they are, we'll get scolded by Okita- sensei again, and you're here now, so you might as well help out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The extra helper Sayuki made a 'Oh, how troublesome!' sort of face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… I have a really bad feeling about this, so I'm going home~" Sayuki said with a bright smile and attempted to turn around, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not letting you!" Keiki immediately grabbed her arm, not allowing her to move. "How naive, Sayuki-senpai. We've obtained a valuable labor asset, so I'm not letting you go this easily."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I knew it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"One year ago, Yuika and the others helped, so now it's Witch-senpai's turn."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that from Yuika, the youngest in the group, Sayuki apparently gave in completely. Once she had promised her help, they began with the cleaning. They moved their finished works to an empty classroom nearby so that the ink could dry. After that they brought in a bucket with dust cloths and other necessary cleaning instruments.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, Senpai, you can have the mop." "Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao handed Sayuki the wet mop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will take care of the tatami space, then." Yuika said and started gathering all the scattered calligraphy paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu and I will go through the room with the cloth then." Mao began to wipe the ink off the walls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, there's some ink on the shelf." Mizuha used the broom to point.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the same efficiency as before, the cleaning of the room proceeded smoothly. After working through most problematic areas, Sayuki's hand moving the mop suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun." "What is it, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are we spending our precious youth cleaning a room?" "Sayuki-senpai, you said the same thing a year ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">One year ago when they were forced to clean this calligraphy room, she tried to skip work with the same argument. Remembering that time, Keiki felt awfully nostalgic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, it seems like Witch-senpai never grows up, not even after graduating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, how naive of you, Koga-san. I'm an adult now, so I don't care what some small-breasted girl says."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?!" "Come on, no fighting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as things were going smoothly, the two eternal rivals got back into a fight. Of course, Keiki was used to this as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Sayuki-senpai. I've heard stories that you've become a rumor among the first-years, namely that you're a black-haired big-breasted beauty who came out of nowhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Well, as long as I stay quiet, people see me as a prim and proper beauty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And now she's said it herself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, do you also feel excited to see my body?" "No, not at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you make me your pet, you can do whatever you want with my boobs." "Man it's been a while since I've heard that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, she was just a perverted mature lady. As soon as she opened her mouth, her perfect image was ruined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, I can't help attracting boys with my beauty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your beauty, huh? Those boys are all looking at your indecent breasts, Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, the representative of small bumps is saying something again. Can any of you hear her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika has been growing! Also, what's that ponytail about, Witch- senpai?! Are you immediately trying to charm all the boys after entering university?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Another fight broke out between the two of them. However, the Kiryuu siblings watched over them with a warm smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sure feels nostalgic." "A real characteristic."</p>
<p class="null-p">The verbal banter between the two was one of the club's trademarks. Whenever these two were around each other, it felt a lot more energetic than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Kiryuu, are you sure about letting them be? We won't finish cleaning at this rate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Mao had said, they would never finish their work if the two of them kept fighting. Keiki wasn't good at getting people back under control, but as the current club president, it was his duty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right people, let's get back to work and clean up everything!" "Okaaaay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite classes being over, the clubroom was as noisy as always, even while everyone was focusing on cleaning. Yuika was as much of a sadist as always, Mao was still trying to gather more material for her BL books, Sayuki showed up after a while and was still on the search for a master, Keiki's new classmate Ayano was on the hunt for his underwear as always, and his little sister slash girlfriend Mizuha still had days where she wanted to go full commando.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki's high school life was riddled with perverted girls around every corner, and even so, he came to like the current life he had. Surrounded by these perverted girls, Keiki, who had wished for a normal life, may have already turned into a pervert himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After the cleaning ended, Keiki had to take care of the last few organizational problems on the agenda, so he told everyone to go home. He grabbed the bucket filled with water and the dust cloths and left the clubroom, carrying it to the boys' toilet on the second floor. There was a large sink mostly used for work-related stuff, and while enjoying the sounds from the sports clubs outside as BGM, Keiki washed the dust cloths.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like I did the same thing a year ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't doing it purposefully, but this flow of events was almost an exact repetition of last year's event. After cleaning, the girls went home early, and he stayed behind to clean the dust cloths. After that, he spotted a couple interlinking arms while walking home. However, that couple was nowhere to</p>
<p class="null-p">be seen, and instead was replaced by three girls with blue skirts talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">As they still had some of their youthful atmosphere left, it was clear they were new students. They seemed to be used to their high school life so far, and they each flashed relaxed expressions as they smiled at each other. Keiki felt the energy from these three rubbing off on him as he went back to his work. After he finished washing everything, he returned the cleaning instruments to the place they belonged and made his way back to the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, I found the love letter on the table."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, that wasn't true now. Neither a love letter nor white pair of panties could be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was one distinct difference Keiki noticed, which made him stop in his tracks. Of course, he didn't even have to look for it. All club members should have left, and yet a single girl stood at the window, illuminated by the setting sun. Upon noticing Keiki's arrival, his girlfriend turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, welcome back, Nii-san." "Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki called out to her, the girl smiled as her hair gently shook in the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you waiting for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep, I wanted to go home together." "You could have gone home without me." "But I'm your girlfriend, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to go home with the person I like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… is such flawless logic that I can't argue against it." Keiki smirked.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see. She waited for me because we're dating.</p>
<p class="null-p">The difference from last year's development was that their relationship had changed. It was simple and minor, but still a definitive change. Upon realizing that he was dating the girl, he felt his chest warm up. While he was basking in this happiness, Mizuha moved away from the window and walked towards the empty table. With a nostalgic gaze in her eyes, she ran her fingers along the wood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's been a year since I left the love letter here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With no name on it and the mysterious panties, you sure sent me on a wild goose chase."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You mean these panties?" Mizuha lifted up her skirt, showing the familiar white panties they had just been talking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I happened to wear the same ones today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't mean you have to show them off like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki reprimanded his little sister for her lack of purity, and she returned her skirt back to normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking about it, the reason we can be together like this is because you kept searching for the person who dropped the panties, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess those panties are the red thread connecting us." "Hehe, so romantic."</p>
<p class="null-p">One year ago, Keiki found the love letter in this very room. In a way, that day at the pool when he flipped up the girl's skirt to find the white panties of destiny had connected the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was always scared of telling you about these feelings of mine. But, day by day, my feelings for you grew stronger. I soon was unable to keep them locked away, so I wrote the love letter, wanting you to know that there's a girl who likes you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was scared of confessing her feelings… But even so, she wanted the person she cared for to know about them. This was how that love letter without a sender written on it came into existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I couldn't bring myself to write my name back then, but I'm glad I mustered up the courage to tell you 'I like you'. Because of that you finally saw me in the same light."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, the girl showed the gentle smile Keiki adored the most. If not for that love letter, nothing would have happened. He wouldn't have had to search for the Cinderella who had dropped her panties. He wouldn't have found out about Sayuki, Yuika, and Mao's fetishes. He would have never remembered that Mizuha and him weren't blood-related. The fact that these two, who had been raised as siblings, now had achieved a mutual love was all because she had mustered up the courage to confess her feelings even the smallest bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">I really am loved…</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since he started dating Mizuha, each passing day was filled with nothing but happiness. He had never known such happiness could exist before sharing the same feelings with the person he loved. When he realized that all of this happiness was a result of her feelings for him, he fell in love with her even more. Or rather, he found himself unable to hold back these feelings-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He ran towards the girl, embracing her with all his might. "N-Nii-san? What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I thought that I'd marry you in the future, I just couldn't hold myself back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, where did that come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I came back to the clubroom, I saw you looking at the ring." "Huh?! Y-You saw me…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, so he had. A few minutes prior, when Keiki arrived back at the room, Mizuha was looking at the necklace hanging down her chest. The item dangling from this necklace naturally was the ring Keiki had given to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had immediately put the necklace back, but Keiki still saw it. "So you turned it into a necklace instead, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't wear a ring at school, after all… but I wanted to always have it on me, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing an engagement ring at school would definitely make her stand out, which was why she chose to wear it on a necklace instead. As long as she didn't take it out, it was hard to see. More than anything, however, Keiki was happy she liked the ring that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I kiss you?" "…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">From within Keiki's arms, the girl slowly nodded. Her smile was charming and emitted a deep ocean of sweet emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she's this cute, of course I'd fall in love even with a pervert…</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the clubroom drenched by the setting sun, Keiki pulled the girl even closer. The fact that they were still at school, and that it would soon close, was all forgotten. Feeling this greatest possible love and its warmth directly, Keiki failed to convey his happiness in words, and instead kissed his albeit perverted but still cutest-in-the-whole-world girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">Many years had passed between that day and the current spring day. Keiki was wearing a white tuxedo he wasn't used to as he opened the door to the room his lover was waiting in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah, it's Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the center of the luxurious room sat the bride, looking at Keiki with a gentle smile. She was wearing a beautiful snow-white wedding dress. It was a shoulder strap-free type, revealing her beautiful shoulders and cleavage, which suited her slender but still well-developed figure. Her skirt was short as well, which called great attention to her dazzling and slim legs. Entranced by this sight, Keiki looked up at the girl as she stood up from her chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I put the dress on… how does it look?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So good I can't say anything but that it's beautiful." "Ehehe, thanks." The bride smiled adorably.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had always been beautiful back in high school, but in the few years that had passed, she had grown even more alluring. It's not like she had grown taller, or that her three sizes had changed, but it was more that the atmosphere around her that felt more mature. She had slightly longer hair as well, and had generally refined her looks rather than changing drastically. Of course, this made Keiki want to scream to the entire world that she would become his wife.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is everybody here already?" Mizuha asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I just talked with the guys. Shouma and Koharu-senpai are still the same. Rintarou seems to still be chasing after Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani-kun even went to the same university as her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And this is where the new information comes in. Apparently, Nagase-san finally gave in and agreed to a date with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Mitani-kun must have worked really hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it's only a matter of time until they start dating."</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering Airi's personality, she would never agree to a date if she really hated it. And Keiki knew all too well how weak Airi was to pushy people. As Rintarou changed his ways, grew a lot more, and started deeply caring for Airi, he basically had become a handsome catch on the level of Shouma. Airi was even more of a beauty, so the two of them were a good match for each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad Mao-chan managed to come despite being so busy." "Nanjou's a top-selling mangaka now after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan's picture book even won a prize a while back, and Tokihara- senpai managed to achieve a break as the 'Too Beautiful Calligraphist'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well online, she's still called 'Too Busty Calligraphist'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, while Mizuha was a university student, she won a prize for a romance novel she wrote, whose characters were based on herself and her older brother. Her impressive vocabulary and prose made her perfect as an author, and Keiki knew that. After graduating, they were both still living in the same house, and she was working on her series that had amassed a fair number of fans. Keiki himself had started working at an average company, enjoying both work and private life equally. Every day when he came home, his beautiful lover was waiting with a delicious dinner, so naturally he could work hard all day long. Even more so since they would soon graduate from simply being lovers, taking the next step to become life partners and tying the knot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that everybody from the calligraphy club and student council could</p>
<p class="null-p">make it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Outside of those two groups, Asahi, Yuuhi, Megumi, and Naoya had managed to make it. Of course, the same goes for their own parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I think you can finally stop calling me Nii-san, Mizuha." "But calling you anything else would just feel weird now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it, really. I like how you call me Nii-san. I really do, but it just doesn't feel fresh anymore. Not to mention that our surname won't change even after the marriage."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do like our name 'Kiryuu', though."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what happens when you marry your step-sister. Putting the name in the family register felt weird, to say the least.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that'll change soon enough." "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eventually, I might have to call you Papa instead." "D-Do you mean… Mizuha-san, are you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, not yet." "Seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought that they had created something new.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But since we graduated from university, I'm starting to feel like wanting one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I will do my best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted children right away, and to have them and his wife call him Papa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But before that, there is something else I need your hard work with, Nii- san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to help your bride put on her panties." "…Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san is not wearing any panties right now." "Are you kidding me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sadly, that is the truth."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha took out a pair of white panties. Of course, they were different from Cinderella's panties, but still charming and pretty in their own right. That aside, however, it seemed to be true that she was indeed going full commando.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Why? Didn't the staff help you with the wedding dress? Wouldn't they have found out if you weren't wearing any?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep, that's why I took them off after putting in the dress." "Why would you do that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That made no sense whatsoever. Why did she go and-?</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I just want to make Nii-san's heart race. I want you to only think about me, and with this, you definitely won't forget about today, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What a crazy bride I got myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki muttered an idle complaint, but was unable to deny the girl and her charming but also teasing smile. The one who falls in love loses. At the point in time he developed feelings for a perverted exibitionist, it was all over for</p>
<p class="null-p">him already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really like having me put on your panties for you, huh?" "I love it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You damn pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was something Keiki always thought about. For the longest time, Mizuha had kept her feelings hidden. That's why she wanted to be seen the way she was, which then became her fetish as an exibitionist. The reason apparently was back when she forgot a change of underwear when she went to the pool in grade school, but that was only one instance out of many, and the bigger one was most likely 'I want the member of the opposite sex I care for to only look at me'.</p>
<p class="null-p">She fell in love with her older brother, yet was unable to confess her feelings. Unable to suppress these feelings, and her desire for him to look at her, she became an exibitionist. That might be one explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nah, I guess she was just born with it." "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing at all. I was just thinking how perverted a married couple we must be to do this right before our wedding ceremony."</p>
<p class="null-p">This made Keiki's heart race in a lot of ways. There was no guarantee that they wouldn't be interrupted by the staff or their parents. Just to make sure, Keiki locked the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, the first time I put your panties on for you was back in our second year in high school, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki still hasn't forgotten everything that had happened in that summer. When Keiki urged the girl to properly wear panties to school, she told him to put them on himself, and he was wrapped up in this terrorist act done by a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We were in a public park back then, right? Thinking back on it, we really did some crazy things back then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And right now, too. If somebody saw us, we'd be done for." "Then why are you making me do this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't put them on right now, your bride will attend the ceremony without wearing any, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… would be bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if God allowed it, Keiki the groom wouldn't. "Wait, is that why you're wearing a short dress?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the exact opposite. I could do this kind of thing because the dress is so short."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I shouldn't have asked."</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, it looked great on her, so Keiki had no room to complain. "Then, dear prince, will you put these panties on me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't like this one bit, but with pleasure." "Then please do." Mizuha handed him the panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even that way of phrasing things was so adorable that Keiki found himself able to laugh about this whole situation. Since the door was locked, he accepted the panties, fully prepared. He crouched down in front of the girl, like a prince about to be crowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">Touching the bare and unprotected legs of his bride, the prince put the snow- white panties on her, this love, just as the prince in the story did with the glass shoe.</p>

<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">And now we've reached the 14th volume. How did you like it? This series started in January 2017, reaching its end after 5 years on the same month. Since I managed to finish the series the way I wanted it to, as an author, I have no more regrets. I think this was the best possible ending for HenSuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since I personally am the type who enjoys seeing the protagonists of a romcom dating after they get together, I paid a lot of attention to Keiki and Mizuha and how their relationship progressed. In this volume, these two started flirting more than they had ever over the past 13 volumes, so I hope you didn't suffer any heartburn or diabetes from reading this volume.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, just as a side note, isn't the cover with Mizuha in a wedding dress way too adorable? After being sent this illustration, I kept on shouting 'Even I would fall in love with her!' inside my heart. Keiki-kun, congratulations on your marriage, and I hope you explode for all eternity.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, this concludes the main series, but there will be an official artbook for the HenSuki series releasing in February, so I would be happy if you went to pick that up as well. It has tons of sune-sensei's illustrations, both in the novel and extras, making this the lewdest book to exist on earth. By the way, I also wrote an extra short story that will be added in there.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, my new series will be releasing this spring, so I hope you check that out as well. Sune-sensei will take over as the illustrator, and the people who enjoyed HenSuki will surely find something to like, so please look forward to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, as much as it pains me to say this, I need to move on to my thanks. To my illustrator sune-sensei who has provided wonderful illustrations since the very beginning; to all the staff involved who helped me to distribute this</p>
<p class="null-p">book, as well as my editor; to all the bookstore employees helping to spread my series; and finally to all the readers who have supported HenSuki all this time, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">I pray that we will be able to see each other again in the future.</p>
