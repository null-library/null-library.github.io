<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki was panicking. The right to go on a date with Keiki had been stolen from her, so her plan to enjoy Christmas Eve was ruined by her kouhai Yuika, and now she was being forced to accept the idea of Keiki going on a date with that flat-chested wench.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of all people, it had to be Koga-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the bathroom in her house, Sayuki let out a sigh as she soaked her body in the hot water. Mao or Mizuha asized, the fact that some shorty had stolen the show hurt her pride quite a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that she's sending me pictures about it… I wanted to go to an aquarium with Keiki-kun, myself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was how Sayuki knew of Keiki's date partner for the day. Yuika kept sending picture after picture of their date. A selfie with the water fountain behind them, a picture of them eating lunch together… Every single picture made them look like a normal couple, which only kindled Sayuki's jealousy further.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"According to Mizuha-san, Keiki-kun hasn't returned home yet, either… Ah!? Don't tell me that they're taking a break somewhere together!? Keiki-kun is going to spend the night with that flat-chested wench!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Today marked the day of Christmas Eve, the 24th of December. It is a day that is enjoyed by couples more than any other. It wouldn't be weird to speculate that their mood had become a bit too excited.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no, that's impossible. Knowing Keiki-kun, that'll never happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki was never the assertive type of boy. Even when Sayuki flashed her breasts that she was very confident about, Keiki had barely any reaction, so there's no way he would suddenly fall victim to the charms of such a shorty… "B-But… what if Keiki-kun did choose Koga-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had been left behind, even though she had won an incredible victory in terms of chest size, and had now been forced to watch this happen. Thinking about their times together in the clubroom, Keiki always doted on Yuika as well, so there's no doubt that he certainly didn't dislike her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that happened, then they might start dating for real…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki felt dizzy. She didn't even want to think about that. "…I guess I should get out now." The heat might have gotten to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about such uncertain things wouldn't do her any good, so she cut off that train of thought and stepped out of the bath into the changing room. She used a fresh towel to dry off her steaming body. After that, she carefully dried her long and silky black hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She saw something move from the corner of her eye. She wrapped the towel around her chest and stood in front of the window. From her viewpoint, she saw white snow falling down outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How rare…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The snow slowly drifted down without making a sound. The scenery was so overwhelming that Sayuki stared at it for a brief moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Snow on Christmas Eve is so romantic… It would be the perfect chance to confess to-Hm? Confess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, a certain doubt entered Sayuki's head. A Christmas date. The fact that they hadn't gotten home yet. This sudden appearance of romantic snow… All these keywords appeared in Sayuki's head one after another, leading her to a</p>
<p class="null-p">certain conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Don't tell me! Is Koga-san going to confess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not just confessing her desire for Keiki to be her slave, but a pure confession of love. Of course, Tokihara Sayuki had no way of knowing for certain that her deadly premonition was completely on point.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Yuika loves Keiki-senpai, so if you were to choose her instead of someone else, she wouldn't mind becoming a normal girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">On this snowy Christas night, standing on top of an empty pedestrian bridge, Koga Yuika made a proposal Keiki would have never expected to hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A normal… girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Met with this sudden proposal, Keiki stared blankly at the girl. He faced the blonde-haired girl, who was wearing a pink one-piece for the date and was clad with a white denim jacket. She had the outer appearance of an angel, but she actually acted like a sadistic queen. She was the kind of person who wouldn't hesitate to stuff her freshly-worn panties into Keiki's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now, this very Yuika had confessed to him, so of course he'd be taken by surprise. However, his underclassman wasn't quite done yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you were to wish for it, Yuika would stop her plans of making you her slave. She won't verbally abuse you anymore, and she won't try to discipline you. Just like today, we could hold hands, talk together, and take pictures. Yuika will become your ideal girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what he had wanted back when he started his De-Perversion Plan. Right now, his kouhai had offered to stop being a pervert out of her own free will.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you won't step on me any longer?" "Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You won't force your panties into my mouth anymore?" "Yuika will be more careful not to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew… That really is just like a normal girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">That much should have been something totally natural, but Keiki couldn't help but feel shocked. Maybe because of all the hardships he had gone through up</p>
<p class="null-p">until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about it? Yuika thinks it's not that bad of a deal." "That… is true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It certainly sounded quite appealing. He would be able to have a cute girlfriend for himself, and he had actually managed to correct one of the perverted girls around him. It actually sounded too good to be true.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just to let you know, Yuika wouldn't make an offer like this to anybody but Keiki-senpai." Yuika blushed a bit as she spoke with a sulking tone. "It's because Yuika likes Keiki-senpai, because she wants you to choose her, that she is willing to become a normal girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She likes Keiki, wants him to choose her, and is offering to become a normal girl. After hearing these straightforward words, Keiki's head started burning up. She tried to hide her flustered reaction, but Keiki could see right through it. It was clear that she truly held feelings for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika-chan actually feels that way towards me…?</p>
<p class="null-p">It still was hard to believe, but the girl apparently loved Keiki for real. If he were to accept this confession, Yuika would become a normal girl, and she would give up on trying to make Keiki her slave. Basically, that showed how serious she was about it. She had confessed to him, prepared for anything that came after.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then what about me? How do I feel about Yuika-chan?</p>
<p class="null-p">If you asked if he liked or hated her, he would choose 'Like' immediately. Today's date was lots of fun, and Yuika definitely was cute whenever she wasn't acting sadistic. Locking arms, holding hands, seeing her happy smile… This cuteness of hers caused Keiki's heart to skip a beat many times. It would be a lie to say he never thought about how great it would be to have her as a girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the event that he answered 'Yes', he would find some success in his plan, and he would manage to get a girlfriend at the same time. This might be a once in a lifetime opportunity for Keiki, who had lived his entire life without a girlfriend. If he just nodded here, a rosy life would await him. He started to think that there was no reason to deny Yuika. And yet-</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, he couldn't bring himself to answer. Even though this cute</p>
<p class="null-p">Kouhai of his had confessed to him. Even though she said she would stop being a pervert. He didn't know the reason why, but he felt something inside of him that pulled him back from giving a response right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, could you give me some time to think about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, he had to use this escape route. He was worried that he might have made his Kouhai mad, so he reluctantly looked at her face, but she seemed relatively calm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't mind." "Eh? …Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika never thought she would get an immediate response anyway. Knowing Senpai, it was obvious it wouldn't turn into a 'Alright, let's go out' kind of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really do understand me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew he didn't have this kind of decisive power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If anything, Yuika is relieved you didn't reject her right away." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fact that you're thinking about it means that you see me as a girl, right?" "!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he was hit with this surprise attack that was paired with a beaming smile, Keiki's heart skipped a beat. He thought that this was a bit too much for him. Today she had been constantly sending surprise attacks his way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika fell in love with Senpai because he always earnestly thought about her and her feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">In this world, only the two of them existed, and Yuika's voice filled the silence. "That's why you can take your time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Reflected in Keiki's eyes was the smile of an angel. That alone would be enough to make him fall head over heels for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will wait for your response."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, she gave Keiki a limitless postponement for his answer to her confession.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: Handing a girl a BL book is a simple job</p>
<p class="null-p">9pm passed, and after Keiki had safely escorted Yuika home, he arrived back at his own safe haven. He sat on the sofa in the living room and gazed at his smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown on the screen was the very last picture they had taken during today's date. The illumination of the train station was behind his Kouhai as she looked into the camera with a beaming smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My lord. She really is cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had her engraved in his mind as a sadistic girl, but seeing a genuine and normal smile like this from her was unbearable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was confessed to by a cute girl. I'm not going to wake up anytime soon, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To Keiki, it was something he would only be able to experience in a dream. He would have never imagined receiving a confession from Yuika, so waking up any second wouldn't surprise him at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But does Yuika-chan really plan on becoming a normal girl…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What if Koga Yuika wasn't a super sadist, but a girl you could find anywhere? If she were to act like she did on today's date on a daily basis, Keiki might just be able to experience the blooming youth he had always wished for. That was just how charming Yuika had been today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that a picture from your date today?" "Woooaeh!? Mizuha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he turned around to face the voice behind him, he found Mizuha standing behind the sofa, taking a glance at his phone. She had just come out of the bath, apparently, and she was wearing a comfy sweater. Her cheeks were slightly red from the heat. She flashed a V-sign, very much something his little sister would do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed. It is Nii-san's personal idol, the wonderful Mizuha-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of occupation is that? But more importantly, how long have you been there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Just a few seconds?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…" Keiki sighed in relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, she hadn't heard the whole part about the confession. "And why are you still like this, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, Mizuha-san was not wearing anything below. Thanks to the shirttail of her sweater, Keiki had no way of knowing for certain, but it wouldn't be weird for her to not be wearing any panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm wearing panties, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good. If you weren't, it'd be time for an emergency family meeting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was relieved to hear she was actually wearing them. If she wasn't, she'd really destroy her Onii-chan's mental health on a daily basis. Unaware of her older brother's worries, however, his little sister's gaze was still glued to the picture on his phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? So you went to see the lights in town with Yuika-chan? Hmmm?" "Eh, ah? …Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You forced your cute little sister to guard the house and went to play with another girl, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, um…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really lonely, you know." "O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why this much should be allowed, right?" Mizuha said. She moved in front of her older brother and grabbed the shirttail of her sweater, slowly lifting it upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san!? Why are you lifting your clothes up!?" "Mizuha doesn't know~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of character is this!? More importantly, your panties! I can see your snow white panties!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No worries. I'll show you my bra as well." "You're telling me not to be worried about this!?" "Ah, oops. I forgot to put on my bra."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're making me worry even more!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, her bare breasts were hiding beneath that sweater. If he was</p>
<p class="null-p">shown something like that, Keiki's reason would break down. "Fufu. At this rate, Nii-san will see all my embarrassing spots…" "So why do you look so happy about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the calligraphy club's resident exhibitionist for you. She's a pervert who gets excited by being seen naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, if you try to look away or run away, things won't end with just showing</p>
<p class="null-p">you, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you planning on doing!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was unsure of what might happen to him, but it was apparent that nothing good would happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is bad, Mizuha won't stop no matter what I say…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could already see everything up to her navel, and her panties in plain view, so it wouldn't take long until the dreaded moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to avoid this at all costs, which is why I invited Nagase-san in the first place…</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, the main goal for today was to escape the frenzy of the group of perverted girls. To escape from the demonic hands that were stimulated by the charm of Christmas, and to protect his own virginity. This was why Keiki had invited Nagase Airi for a date instead. However, he had been betrayed by the girl, whom he had assumed to be his ally, and was instead set up on a date with Yuika instead, which basically ruined everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe I shouldn't have come home today after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">But by the time he realized this, it was already too late-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nii-san? Just a bit longer, and you'll be able to see everything, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha continued to slowly lift her clothes upwards, showing the undersides of her breasts. She flashed a seductive smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh!? Now that it's come to this-" "…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't allow his little sister to reveal her bare breasts on a holy day like this. In order to stop this exhibitionistic play, he jumped up from the sofa and grabbed Mizuha's shoulders. After that, he kissed her cheek without a second thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fueh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Met with this surprise attack, Mizuha put her hands on her cheeks, looking up at her older brother in a daze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nii-san…? What are you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought I'd pay you back for leaving you lonely… So could you just accept this for today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you do something like this, I'll get even more excited, you know?" "Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, seeing Nii-san act flustered was pretty good in itself, so I'll forgive you." "…Thanks a bunch."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wanted to point out that both of their faces were red, but he kept it to himself. Either way, the strip show had been stopped, and that was all that mattered. Mizuha took a moment to fix her clothes and then gave an apologetic smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for going overboard." "Yeah, that was bad for my heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'm feeling refreshed now that I was able to strip in front of Nii-san." "Boy am I glad to hear that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha might look like a rational human being, but deep inside she was still a pervert. Keiki might have managed to avoid a worst-case scenario, but a rampaging pervert was something that had to be avoided at all costs. He had painfully learned time and time again that letting down your guard for a single moment could be life-threatening.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'd better keep Yuika-chan's confession a secret from everyone else in the club…</p>
<p class="null-p">This was what happened after the date. If the others found out, things would go south insanely quick. Keiki's body won't hold out against an onslaught from the others, so he decided to keep this fact a secret from everyone.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come here, take a look! Here we have Minami Mao's new release 'How to eat a delicious Christmas Cake'! One book? Thank you for the purchase!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In return for the 500 yen coin, Keiki handed over a thin book to the office-lady- looking Onee-san. After watching her walk off with a warm smile on her face,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why am I selling BL books here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few days had passed after the Christmas date, making this the 29th of December. Keiki was attending a doujinshi convention held in the local gymnasium, and he was the sales boy in this atmosphere overflowing with heat and passion. Of course, there was only one person who would be so cruel as to force Keiki through this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing, Kiryuu? You've gotta attract more customers." "Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person beside him bossing him around was none other than the reddish- brown-haired girl Nanjou Mao, today disguised with her hair down and a beret on her head. Around two hours ago, the girl had called Keiki. He had been summoned here and forced to sell the (R-18) BL doujinshi he had been the model for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've got some guts calling me here early in the morning and making me work like a slave."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You went on a Christmas date with Yuika, so helping me here should be the least you can do for me, right? It was a lot of work making the manuscript for this after you refused to act as my model, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of absurd accusation is that? And how did you hear about my date with Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because the person herself bragged about it. She talked about how you two went to the aquarium, how you carried her like a princess, and all that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything had been leaked already. But at least she kept the confession a secret.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wanted to go on a date, too." "What was that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing. Anyway, I won't let you go home today until we're completely sold out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah yeah, let's just get this over with."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki mentally hyped himself up to quickly sell all the books they had.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, considering how many she brought with her, this will probably be a long</p>
<p class="null-p">battle… Keiki thought to himself, but that turned out to be a needless worry. The Shortcake Series attracted customer after customer to Mao's booth, and the mountain of books rapidly grew smaller and smaller.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your books are really popular, Nanjou." "Thankfully, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your title is as horrible as ever, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you on about? It's the perfect name for the event. On this special night of Christmas Eve, Shouto gets to fully enjoy Keeki in all his glory. That's where the title came from."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not interested in the slightest, so please don't give me an explanation for it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like dying already just imagining a scene where the character he had modeled was getting messed up by the character his best friend was modeled after. He would have preferred to not see it at all, but because he had a mountain of books in front of him depicting it, that was nearly impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I have to accept the fact that Nanjou is pretty famous as a mangaka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Disregarding the content, it was admirable of her to work on something she truly loves. Even in a small local event like this, the fact that so many people stopped by showed just how talented she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, the club president stopped by before you came." "Sayuki-senpai did?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She hurried home because she wanted to read it right away, though." "So that's the kind of fans you have, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Are her entrance exams going to be okay?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once this is over, I have to prepare for FuyuComi." "Eh? Wasn't FuyuComi supposed to start today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll only participate on the last day. I do plan on walking around tomorrow, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just how active are you, Minami-sensei…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she ever get a free day? The two continued their everyday banter, and thanks to Mao's popularity, her books were all sold out in a mere two hours.</p>
<p class="null-p">"50 books, all gone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a small event, but I guess I should have brought a few more with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, you really helped me out today, Kiryuu. I would've been in a lot of trouble without you. Here's your compensation for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks~" Keiki accepted the can of coffee. "I'll be on my way home now.</p>
<p class="null-p">How about you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go check out the other circles some more." "I see. I guess that means we'll split up now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The doujinshi had all been sold, and the people organizing the event would clean up the table and chairs, so Keiki had no more helper work to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't mind going on an adventure into the BL world with you, though." "I humbly decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki would rather not step into this forsaken world. He was just about to walk away when Mao called out to him again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait a second, Kiryuu." "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you have some time, could I ask you to go on an errand?" "Errand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it's about this…" Mao took out an A4-sized paper bag. "This is the last copy of the newest release that I have."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you making me carry…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What if someone saw Keiki with this in his possession? Then again, everything had already been lost when Keiki had to work as a sales boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be like that. I was wondering if you could deliver that to Yuika's place." "Huh? Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Is there something wrong with that?" "No…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As of right now, Keiki still hadn't told anyone else about Yuika's confession. If the club members of the calligraphy club found out about this, the masochistic girl would throw a fit and Keiki's exhibitionistic little sister would start another strip show. In order to avoid any risky business, Keiki hadn't told Mao, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't mind mailing it over, but it'd be bad if someone from her family found it, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that'd be an instant family gathering, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could imagine all hell breaking loose if her parents found this book. The conversation at the dinner table would be more than just awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika's really looking forward to reading it. I'll be busy until FuyuComi is over, so she'd have to wait until next year to get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could understand the desire to read the newest release of a series he liked.</p>
<p class="null-p">She'd definitely be happy if I brought it over…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could already imagine a blooming smile in his mind. He compared the mental pain of having to carry a BL book to the smile of a Kouhai. After a brief silence while his internal battle was waging, he let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright, just this once."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unrelated to the confession he received, Keiki figured that she would be happy about it, so he decided to accept Mao's request.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around thirty minutes after Keiki left the gymnasium, he stood in front of the Koga Household.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I actually came here, but what should I even say when I see Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His mission was only to deliver the plastic bag. But that was the main reason why Keiki hesitated to ring the doorbell. As of right now, Keiki hadn't given her a response to the confession. He had thought about that confession every day since, but no solid response had formed just yet. Seeing the girl like this would be terribly awkward. Now that he had accepted this request from Mao, he couldn't exactly back down at the last second.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, whatever happens, happens…!" Keiki forced himself forward to ring the doorbell.</p>
<p class="null-p">After he did so, the door opened after a brief silence. "Yes, who is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki would have been more than happy if one of her parents had opened the door, but it turned out to be the very girl he didn't want to meet. Indeed, it was Koga Yuika, with her usual blonde hair and green eyes. But the reason Keiki's voice sounded dumbfounded was another-</p>
<p class="null-p">Eh, what? Why is she wearing bear pajamas?</p>
<p class="null-p">For whatever reason, the girl looked like a giant, comfy bear thanks to the pajamas she was wearing. She had the hood on, and the bear ears made her look really comfy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-senpai? What brings you here?" "What happened to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Why don't you come in for now? It must be cold outside." "Ahh, yeah… That would be the best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Talking about a BL book wouldn't be the best idea while standing in the entrance. Thus, he gratefully accepted Yuika's invitation and headed inside. He was guided to the living room and sat down on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, is coffee okay for you?" The girl asked as she headed over to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Yuika will brew some right away." The girl hummed to herself as she prepared the coffee.</p>
<p class="null-p">After watching her for a bit, Keiki was the first to speak up. "May I ask where your parents went, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're working. They don't even have time off at the end of the year. It's like they're working at some kind of black company~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't sure how to respond to that, but Keiki's parents were fairly similar. His parents showed no signs of coming home even at the end of the year. After this, a bit of time passed, and then Yuika brought back two cups.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go. It's still hot, so be careful." "Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">She put them down on the table. Keiki was thankful for some warm coffee to heat up his body, but the cup was still scorching hot. Instead, he took out his smartphone and pointed the camera at Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai? What are you doing?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Click click click click click click!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you just silently taking pictures!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I thought that I would preserve this sight. I haven't ever seen such a cute bear before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Bear? …Ah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, Yuika seemed to remember what clothes she was wearing. Her face turned beet red, and she frantically waved her hands around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This isn't what you think it is! Yuika isn't wearing childish clothes! She just happened to put it on today…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It looks exceptionally good on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that!? Are you saying that Yuika is a small child who looks good in such childish clothes!? You must be think that it's weird that pajamas from Yuika's middle school days are still a perfect fit, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never said anything like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai is an idiot! Yuika's chest might be small, but she is a high school student!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to be so embarrassed. What's wrong with a high school student liking bear pajamas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmph, you really don't get it." "Don't get what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't want the person she likes to think she's childish!" "O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait ten… no, five minutes!" Yuika said as she dashed out of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad. Yuika-chan is saying such cute stuff without a moment's hesitation…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a terrorist attack using a cuteness bomb. Even with an angry face like that, Keiki couldn't help but think that she was cute, and her words held insane destructive power. In order to hide the pounding of his heart, Keiki took a sip of coffee, and Yuika eventually returned wearing western clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Thanks for waiting…" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing a white sweater with a skirt and black tights, a winter-ish look that made Keiki entranced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, it's nothing… my apologies."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you turn all polite towards the end?" Yuika tilted her head in confusion and sat down on the sofa facing Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, you really surprised Yuika when you suddenly showed up in front of our door."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sent you an email, but I guess you didn't see it?" "Oh, really? Sorry, Yuika left her phone in her room." "What were you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cleaning the house. Did you finish your new year's cleaning already, Senpai?" "We did it yesterday. Mizuha is constantly cleaning anyway, so all we had to</p>
<p class="null-p">do was wash the windows and that kind of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's cleaning skills weren't to be taken lightly. She even made the clubroom look sparkly clean before winter break.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those pajamas are fairly useful for cleaning. Yuika doesn't have to worry if it gets dirty, and thanks to the hood, her hair won't get full of dust."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's why you were wearing those bear pajamas."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, wearing stylish western clothes while cleaning the house would be a total waste, so those pajamas were no doubt the logical choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what brings you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Nanjou asked me to bring you something. I totally forgot because of the pajamas."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please forget about that already… Wait, Mao-senpai?" "Yeah, she wanted me to bring you her newest release." "Mao-senpai's new release!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant Yuika heard those words, she jumped forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it 'How to eat a delicious Christmas cake' by any chance!?" "Indeed it is… Here you go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much!" Yuika's eyes brightened up, and she reached out for the plastic bag with her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that same hand stopped only a few inches before she touched it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, she directed a sharp gaze towards the plastic bag. "Mmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… it seemed like Yuika would look like a pervert if she just accepted this happily… Even after she said she would become a normal girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">During the holy night of Christmas Eve, Yuika had declared that she would stop being a pervert. As a result of that, she apparently felt a certain degree of reluctance to accept this doujinshi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't need it, I can take it with me when I leave, you know?" "No way?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu. What will it be, Yuika-chan?" "Uuuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki playfully waved the plastic bag in front of Yuika, who turned teary-eyed. "You don't have to hold back if you really want to read it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that it's a bit extreme, knowing Nanjou, but even normal girls read this sort of stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Nanjou asked me to deliver this to you, so it'd be bad if you didn't take it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then…" Yuika hesitated a bit, but eventually reached out for the plastic bag. After that, she tightly embraced it, flashing a beaming smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Thank you very much. Yuika will have to thank Mao-senpai later." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's a bit of a shame." "What is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thought you came here to give her a response, and it was just an errand. Yuika was actually pretty nervous, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It couldn't be helped that she felt that way. However, sadly Keiki didn't have a response yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I need a bit more time for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. Yuika will forgive you since you brought her Mao-senpai's</p>
<p class="null-p">new release."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly, Yuika let Keiki go fairly easily. Her sulking attitude seemed to be an act.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To make up for it, wouldn't you mind if Yuika joined you?" "Huh? Ah, I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, if you would excuse Yuika-" She said and sat to Keiki's left. Then she clung to Keiki's arm like they were lovers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan? What are you doing?" "Fufu. It's Yuika's self-PR time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Self-what now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There aren't many chances like this. So Yuika thought she had to be more aggressive to help Keiki-senpai come to a decision easier."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, if you were to take Yuika as your girlfriend, you would be able to experience something like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She spoke like she was promoting a new game that was about to release.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or at least that's the excuse Yuika thought of, but she just wanted to cuddle with you like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika loves getting spoiled, so she'll probably be really clingy if we start dating… Do you hate spoiling others, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Not really…" "Fufu, perfect." "!?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Keiki's heart skipped a beat at Yuika's innocent smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is bad…! Yuika-chan smells really nice, she's really cute when she's acting spoiled, and her soft chest is hitting my arm!</p>
<p class="null-p">If Keiki had let down his guard for but a moment, he might have just pushed down Yuika right then and there.</p>
<p class="null-p">This has to be against the rules!</p>
<p class="null-p">This cuteness was the ultimate weapon that would be able to kill Keiki's virginity. It was strong enough to make Keiki lose his excessive defensiveness towards his own chastity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Calm down… She's still that Queen who stuffed her freshly-worn panties into my mouth…</p>
<p class="null-p">She was acting like a normal girl right now, so she might take off her mask the moment Keiki relaxed. For now, he had to observe her and see if he could pull through with his De-perversion plan. That's why he had to do something about this situation right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, Yuika-chan?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The stimulus is a bit too tough on me, so could we keep it a bit more mild?" Keiki said, seeking to lessen the stimulus he was suffering from.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So then…" His Kouhai temporarily moved her body away, only to grasp Keiki's right hand with her left. "Something like this should be fine, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, this should be…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a much better fit for a beginner in love like Keiki. It made him feel relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah, this really feels like we're lovers…</p>
<p class="null-p">They sat next to each other on the sofa, holding hands and nothing more. Just with that, Keiki started to imagine them being a couple, and a soft sensation filled his heart. But why is it that…?</p>
<p class="null-p">…Hm? Just now…</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki glanced at the smiling profile of his Kouhai, he felt something like a gloomy sensation in his heart as well as a sense of discomfort. He felt a faint pain inside his chest.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, Keiki called his kouhai Nagase Airi to a nearby cafe. It was the same cafe he had used to get Yuika and Airi closer as friends. While he was pouring some hot coffee, the girl with her beige-colored twintails entered the cafe. She was wearing a cardigan with a flared skirt, and she gently waved her hand as she spotted Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, Kiryuu-senpai." "Yo, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">After exchanging a brief greeting, the girl sat down across from Keiki. At the same time, the waitress arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like a cream soda."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll take some more coffee."</p>
<p class="null-p">They gave the waitress their orders, and they quickly received their drinks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki flashed her a smile and spoke. "I'm listening."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry that I stood you up on Christmas Eve." "Very well."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the 24th of December, Airi had broken their promise to go on a date, and had instead sent Yuika. Indeed, this had been Airi's goal from the very start.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You forgave me fairly easily. Knowing Kiryuu-senpai, I figured you'd be more agitated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of image do you have of me?" "Fufu. Would you like to know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, I'll pass."</p>
<p class="null-p">If he heard that, his self-evaluation would probably take a dive, so there was no need to hurt himself like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Are you angry after all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really. You were just doing it for Yuika-chan's sake." "Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have been hung up on the fact that she had basically deceived Keiki. But when she heard his response, she let out a relieved sigh and ate some of her cream soda ice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leaving that aside, however, I'm angry." Airi muttered. "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why didn't you give Yuika a response?" "Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such a cute girl confessed to you, you know? Every normal boy would give an instant okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well, I guess it makes sense that you've heard that from Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi had been tasked to set up the date, after all, so it made sense that she received a detailed report.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I support Yuika. I heard a lot during a phone call. How she went to the aquarium with Senpai, how she got carried like a princess… All those kinds of happy stories, you know! She's super cute, isn't she!? She's so cute that I was about to fall in love myself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should you really be telling me that?" "Of course not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I figured as much!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So please keep it a secret from Yuika." "Will do."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, Keiki didn't expect Yuika to talk that fondly of their date… "Just how cute can she be…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki writhed in agony at the thought of his Kouhai happily retelling the events of the date to her friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why didn't you tell her okay? It's nothing short of a miracle to get a confession from a beautiful girl like Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mizuha, even Yuika had confessed to him. For Keiki, who had no experience with love and youth at all until now, it was a miracle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did she fall in love with someone like me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was willing to basically kill her old self so that she could be together with Keiki. Even though he had never done anything special for her, she held this much affection towards him. It was a mystery for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's not 'someone like you', okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't talk badly about the person my friend fell in love with." She spoke calmly, but she seemed agitated.</p>
<p class="null-p">With an angry, almost sad expression, Airi continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai is always acting considerate of me, your kouhai. You tried to fix my hatred of men, and you helped me change. It might not have been anything special for you, but I was really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I can understand why Yuika has chosen you. You're a person who deserves to be loved, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san…" Keiki was bewildered by the girl's serious tone. At the same time, his cheeks relaxed in happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think Shouma told me something similar before."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki found the mysterious love letter, Shouma gave Keiki some confidence. Just like Airi did now, he had told Keiki that he was someone who had the right to be the target of someone's affection.</p>
<p class="null-p">I haven't grown at all from back then…</p>
<p class="null-p">He never expected to suddenly have infinite confidence. However, there are people who luckily supported him to such extent. Maybe he should face his future more confidently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you get it, then tell her yes already and make her happy." "That's a different thing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How indecisive. What gripe could you possibly have with Yuika?" "That's not it, I just don't want to rush things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indecisive bastards like you should burn in hell." "What did you just say!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What a terrible thing to tell someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, there's nothing I could complain about. I was really happy when she said she would become a normal girl for me, and that shows how serious she is about me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, why-?" Then Airi raised her head like she had realized something. "Don't tell me, do you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, it's nothing." She had started her sentence, but she quickly swallowed her words. "Anyway, I'd feel bad for her if she had to wait for too long. Don't you dare make her cry, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't keep things up like this forever. He knew that he had to give her an answer as quickly as possible. But the answer just wouldn't come. Even though she went so far as to say that she would become a normal girl for him, he still couldn't choose her. Why?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is love, anyway?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did that come from? Are you asking me?" "It figures…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know if I'm right or not, but… if you want the other person to smile, if you want them to be happy, doesn't that mean that you like them?" Airi's assumption of love was quite romantic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Do you have someone like that, Airi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll hit you, okay?" Airi gave an irritated response.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika said that she would be willing to become a normal girl if it made Keiki fall in love with her. If that feeling was love, then Airi's explanation wasn't too far off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, was that it? If you wanted to hear my opinion about Yuika, couldn't you have just called me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, there's something I wanted to give you, Nagase-san." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, for you." Keiki took out a small plastic bag from his jacket's chest pocket. "A Christmas present. Though it's a bit late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had been planning to go on a date with you that day, after all. I had it prepared, but you never came."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, I'd be happy if you could take it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…T-Thank you very much." Airi accepted the present. "Can I open it?" When Keiki nodded, Airi slowly opened the plastic bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside was a memo pad with a cherry blossom design, and a pink pen to</p>
<p class="null-p">match. It was what Keiki had bought the day prior to the date after a lot of thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's still out of season, but since you always take notes, I thought it'd be perfect."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You won't get anything from me if you try to make me happy like this." "That threat doesn't hold much value if you avert your gaze like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, that only showed how happy she was. Keiki didn't miss the fact that her cheeks were flushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you show up in the student council room again, I'll make you some tea." "I'm looking forward to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Keiki still couldn't think of a response to the confession, but at least he managed to hand over the present that was long overdue. Of course, he kept it a secret that his heart beat a bit faster when he saw that Airi was this happy about the present.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The year was in its final stretch. It was the 31st of December. Keiki was enjoying his time under the kotatsu in the living room when Mizuha came from the kitchen with a tray.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The soba noodles are done." "Finally!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Two plates were set on the table. Mizuha joined Keiki under the kotatsu, and they clapped her hands together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the food!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They both started working on their soba noodles. "Delicious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder about this every year, but consuming carbohydrates this late at night feels like we're doing something bad, doesn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's little sister froze in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine… I held back during dinner, and tomorrow is the first shrine visit, so after lots of walking, I'll work off that bit of extra fat… yeah, it's fine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… I'm sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had apparently said something he shouldn't have. After he told Mizuha not to sweat the small stuff, she continued her late-night dinner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The year's about to end, huh?" "Yeah. A lot happened, didn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The biggest event that left an impression on Keiki was the love letter with panties attached. Ever since he had found Cinderella's written confession in the classroom, more and more girls had revealed their perverted tendencies, and abnormal circumstances filled Keiki's daily life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, a lot happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back on it, the year had been filled with perverts. "In the end, Mom and Dad never came home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's the same as ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their parents were an existence that even their own children rarely encountered. During the year, they were basically never home, and there were times when they didn't even come home at the end of the year. Of course, their parents couldn't be blamed. Both Keiki and Mizuha often spoke with them over the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought about his parents, who were probably employed at a black company, during his dinner. The countdown on the TV started. A female announcer stated that the last minute had arrived. And then, once only five seconds were left…</p>
<p class="null-p">'Five, four, three, two, one-Happy New Year!'</p>
<p class="null-p">The new year began with the announcer and audience clapping their hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a pleasant mood, Mizuha and Keiki celebrated the new year. "Happy New Year, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please treat me well this year too, Nii-san." They exchanged a few words and smiled. "Oh, everyone's sending me messages."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm getting them, as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma and Koharu had already sent Keiki a message, and Ayano was the starting point for the student council. After that followed the others, and Sayuki and Mao soon after.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Tokihara-senpai sent me a calligraphy picture."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here."</p>
<p class="null-p">While responding to each of the messages, Keiki received yet another. "Oh, from Yuika-chan… Hm? A picture?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with a message, Keiki received a single selfie. She was sitting on her bed, taking a selfie from above, throwing a kiss at the camera in her pajamas. The text underneath read 'Does this get your heart racing?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"That Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course it made Keiki's heart beat faster. Ever since the confession, that little devil had gotten much more aggressive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew, a thrown kiss. Yuika-chan sure is bold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't appreciate you peeking at my phone all the time." "It's because you were grinning to yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wasn't grinning!" "You totally were." "No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan is really cute, after all. I'm a bit surprised to see that she sent that picture to you. Did something happen that made you two get closer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What might you be talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Staaaaaaare…</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was weak to the stare of his little sister. The atmosphere made it seem like she already knew everything. Even though Keiki hadn't done anything bad, he subconsciously averted his gaze in guilt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine. We'll be visiting the shrine together with everyone from the club tomorrow, so we should probably head to bed now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yessir!" Keiki sighed in relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">From outside his gaze, Mizuha spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nii-san, could you look over here for a second?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Peek."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pfft!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki turned his gaze over towards Mizuha, she was sitting on the sofa, both her hands on her skirt as she showed her panties. Since she was wearing kneesocks not pantyhose, so the pink underwear came out clearly</p>
<p class="null-p">not tights today, the pink underwear was totally visible.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Wah! Mizuha-san!? What are you doing!?" "Your first view of the year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never said I wanted anything like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san will probably see lots of panties this year, as well, so I thought that I'd at least be your first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not looking at them because I want to, okay?" "Fufu, I took your first panty view."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What even is that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had created a new word, and she giggled. It seemed like this year would be another busy one, with Keiki being dragged around by the perverts even more.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: The Kotatsu-loving Tokihara-san</p>
<p class="null-p">"…ki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-senpai. Wake up." "…Wah? What…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the night of December 31st, after getting his first panty-flash of the year, Keiki woke up upon hearing someone calling his name. He found Yuika sitting on his bed, gazing down at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you finally woke up. Good morning, Senpai~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, huh? Why are you in my room, Yuika-chan?" Keiki lifted himself upright, confused by the appearance of the sudden visitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once her entire body entered his field of view- "…Huuuh!?" A cry escaped Keiki's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene that had opened up in front of him was too unbelievable. The blonde-haired girl sitting on the bed was neither wearing clothes nor underwear. Instead, she smiled at him in her birth attire.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan!? Why are you naked!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so surprised? Aren't you naked as well, Keiki-senpai?" "Eh? …Ah, you're right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't just Yuika, but Keiki himself was wearing nothing. He was going full exposure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, we're both naked now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you seem so happy about it!? And hide your body, will you!? I can see everything!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Why are you panicking like that? We're already lovers, aren't we?" "Lovers!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koga Yuika and Kiryuu Keiki are lovers? They had ended up in a haha hehe fufu</p>
<p class="null-p">Relationship?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, hold on! Wait just a second! When did that happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been confessed to, but he didn't remember giving a response yet. When Keiki asked that, Yuika blushed as she put both her hands on her cheeks, her body twisting and turning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't you say it a few hours ago? You embraced the embarrassed Yuika, and said 'I'm falling in love with your eyes'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said something embarrassing like that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter what you said. Yuika was just happy that you chose her, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-" On the narrow bed, Yuika slowly wrapped her arms around Keiki. "Tonight, please take Yuika's everything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waaaaaah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, love you <3"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh!? Don't push those small but soft things against meeeee!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt the defenseless and direct sensation of Yuika's chest pressed up against him, and the virgin boy let out a shriek of despair. At this rate, they'd go all the way to his 'graduation'. He'd lose his chastity without even knowing what was going on-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a moment!" "Huh? Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who interrupted this blooming romance was Tokihara Sayuki, who suddenly appeared on top of the bed. "Why are you here? And why are you also naked?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, Sayuki was also naked herself. She didn't even try to hide her well-endowed chest, as Keiki found trouble tearing his gaze away. Not to mention that he could see a lot of other places as well, thanks to the pose she was taking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't believe you, Koga-san. You're trying to steal my Keiki-kun away from me. You can't pronounce yourself his lover while forgetting me, his legal wife. You should know your place!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who's the legal wife?! Yuika is Keiki-senpai's girlfriend, so she's the new</p>
<p class="null-p">wife!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of development is this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chaos ensued at the sudden appearance of the black-haired beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only Yuika is allowed to receive Keiki-senpai's love! Because he confessed to her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, even I've been confessed to, you know. We were looking at the night scenery from our hotel room, and he took me by the chin and said 'I love your breasts more than anything in the world', you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I seriously say that?! And that kind of confession actually makes you happy, Senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought it was wonderful that you were honest with your desires." "Oh. right. I forgot you're that kind of person."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Sayuki-san is a helpless pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Hey, Keiki-kun? I'm sure you prefer my big breasts over whatever small things Koga-san has." The black-haired beauty said as she took a leopard stance in front of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did so, her soft-looking chest was in plain view, and it shook back and forth with every little movement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. If anything, Keiki-senpai finds charm in mine if for nothing but the sense of immorality!" The blonde-haired girl took the same pose as Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her small yet tender chest softly shook.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is exceptionally bad!</p>
<p class="null-p">To his right, he had Sayuki, and to his left, he had Yuika. The moment they appeared on his bed naked, the situation had already gone completely haywire, but now they were both approaching him with their chests completely in the open. Because of this overabundance of eroticism, Keiki's reason started to break apart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So then, let's have a showdown on who can satisfy Keiki-kun the most!" "That sounds good to Yuika!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">…When Keiki heard those words, it was already too late. "Here we go, Keiki-kun! Squeeze!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika as well! Squeeze!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyaaaaaah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was clung to from both sides, and he felt the softness of their cleavages directly against his skin, which sent his reason flying. Being sandwiched by small and big breasts at the same time made him almost bleed from his nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a great life I had, to be honest…</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when he experienced a fanservice scene that a harem protagonist would be jealous about, Keiki's consciousness left him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When his consciousness returned, Keiki was yet again lying in his own bed. When he looked over at the clock next to his pillow, he saw that it was 6am, and neither Yuika nor Sayuki were with him. That was enough to tell him that it was just a dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was one hell of a lewd dream…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right at the start of the new year, he had a dream that couldn't have been any lewder. Being approached by two naked girls? Just how much desire did he have bottled up inside him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, you two." Keiki apologized for seeing the two girls naked in his dream.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After waking up from that horrendous dream, time passed up until 10am of the new year. Keiki and Mizuha made their way to the shrine together, where they spotted Yuika and Mao in front of the shrine archway. Yuika, who was wearing a blue kimono, caught sight of the two of them first, and she waved her hand with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, Mizuha-senpai, happy New Year." "Happy New Year. Let's keep it close like before." "Happy New Year, Yuika-chan, Mao-chan." "Happy New~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, Keiki, Mizuha, and Mao all exchanged their New Year greetings. "You're wearing a long-sleeved, one huh? It looks good on you, Yuika-chan." "Ehehe, Yuika's mother helped her put it on."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Yuika was wearing a beautiful blue kimono, which made her look more grown up. The pouch she was holding matched the kimono, as well. As a side note, Mizuha was wearing a white duffle coat along with a skirt and tights, which gave her a rather childish look, and Mao had a comfortable-looking pair of pants and a jacket, giving off a casual vibe. As for Keiki, he was wearing a white knitted denim jacket and skinny black jeans.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to look lame in front of the girl who said she liked me, after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">It was very pure and simple thinking, but it was the best Keiki could manage as a beginner in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now we're just waiting for Sayuki-senpai, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The club prez sent me an email that said 'I have some business, so you go on ahead'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of business?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows?" Mao shrugged. "I don't know what it is, but we'll eventually run into her, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was still hung up on the 'business' part, but thinking too much about it wouldn't do anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's go, shall we?" He looked at the others. "Okay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The four of them walked towards the shrine. Since it was right after the beginning of the new year, a lot of other people had gathered there already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Thank you very much for the new release, Mao-senpai. It was as wonderful as ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-chan came here immediately after the FuyuComi." "I'm surprised you didn't collapse after that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had participated on the final day of the FuyuComi on the 31st of December, which was the day prior. She had sold all of the copies of her new book she had brought with her, and immediately made her way home to make it in time for the first shrine visit with everyone. That was quite the harsh schedule she was following.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, don't underestimate the passion of a fujoshi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just amazed more than anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">Exchanging words like this, they walked down the shrine pathway, which was lined in stalls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it's Kei-kun-senpai and everyone from the calligraphy club." "Rintarou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The first-year secretary from the student council, Mitani Rin, walked towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Happy new year, Kei-kun-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right back at you. You're not wearing female clothes today, I see." "Ahaha, even I can't put on a skirt every single day of the year."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou was wearing typical male pants with a coat, but even then, he could easily be mistaken for a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you off to pay your visits to the shrine, Senpai?" "Yup. What about you, Rintarou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was on my way home. We had plans to visit together with everyone, but I overslept and had to do it on my own."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you up all night or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, I was busy enjoying my gravure idol picture collection, and I lost track of time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a really awful reason to be late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, this year I wished that I would get a big-breasted girlfriend." "You're way too honest with your own desires…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing these words from Rintarou, the girls from the calligraphy club all took a few steps back, yet he showed no signs of being bothered by this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh, and Kei-kun-senpai…" Rintarou brought his body closer to Keiki, speaking in a quiet voice so that the group of girls couldn't hear them. He looked over at them-or rather at a certain individual in the midst of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was thinking this back during the culture festival, but Mizuha-senpai really is cute, right? She's totally my type."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, you saw her at the maid cafe, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shiho had asked Rintarou who his type was, he had answered Mizuha, as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's pretty popular with the first-years as well, you know? She knows how to cook, she's skilled with her household duties, she's always kind, and she's very proper."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…She's not as proper as you might think." "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nothing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had decided to keep the fact that Kiryuu Mizuha was an exhibitionist a secret. If someone else found out that on some days she came to school without panties, she might not be able to go to school anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, could you maybe introduce me to her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I refuse. Someone who's only out for breasts won't get my Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How rude. That makes it sound like I'm some kind of bastard who can only see girls for their chests."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And who was the one who just wished for a big-breasted girlfriend?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I won't lie that I quite like the idea of Mizuha-senpai having more than she actually shows."</p>
<p class="null-p">"See!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch, I get it. I'll do something about it myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their conversation came to an end, and Rintarou stepped away. "I'll be taking my leave here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, see you." Keiki saw his kouhai off and turned towards the others. When he did, he was greeted by the three girls all giving him cold stares. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what's with this atmosphere?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving aside Rintarou and his constant talk about breasts, Keiki saw no reason why he would deserve such treatment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Kiryuu?" "Y-Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you come to a common agreement on how much borrowing that photo collection would cost you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?" Keiki's eyes turned into dots, absolutely lost as to what Mao was talking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For crying out loud. Kiryuu, keep that talk for when no girls are around." "It can't be helped, Nii-san is a chest sommelier."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, you pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why am I facing this barrage of criticism!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the girls had assumed Keiki's previous talk with Rintarou was about lewd books and photo collections, so he had to work himself to death to clear up the misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, after the four had lined up at the shrine, their turn finally came up. They stood next to each other, threw 500 yen coins into the offering box, rang the ball, and clapped their hands together. Then, it went from Yuika to Mizuha to Keiki to Mao-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wish for lots of material with Kiryuu and Akiyama together this year…" "I wish for Nii-san to finally barge in on me bathing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">From both sides, Keiki could hear indecent wishes, but he decided to ignore them.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wish to survive another year plagued by all these perverts…</p>
<p class="null-p">With everything he had experienced the past year, Keiki knew exactly what he had to wish for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, what should we do now?" He asked. "Yuika wants to buy her fortune slip."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, same here." "Sounds good to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, Mizuha and Mao all agreed with the idea, so they headed to the shrine's shop. After handing the Onee-san in priestess attire the money, they all got their own fortune slip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, I got terrible luck…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The top batter got terrible luck right away…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It says 'Your luck at work is great, but breaks are important. If not, you'll collapse from exhaustion.' Huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not really advice you'd normally hear as a high school student."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, Keiki had to agree that Mao should take more frequent breaks from her work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got slightly good luck. My overall luck is pretty average, and I'm told that 'Good luck will come'. What about you, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here, only slightly good luck…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't exactly bad, but the additional information was what made Keiki so uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="null-p">'A good year awaits you. However, for having committed illicit acts, heavenly punishment will fall upon you. In particular, from above your head.'</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an oddly specific comment, which left even Mao and Mizuha puzzled. "Huh, that's a very straightforward warning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe the blackboard is going to fall on your head?" "As if."</p>
<p class="null-p">Things like that had never happened to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I'm not perverted enough that I would just 'commit illicit acts', so it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, you're a pervert through and through, Kiryuu." "Indeed, Nii-san is a pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai couldn't be more shameful." "You all agree with it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like he had been betrayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, after having that dream, I can't exactly refute them here…</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, he decided to change the topic. "What did you get, Yuika-chan?" "Excellent luck, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the paper, it said 'Great overall luck, but dealing with love will prove difficult. Maybe someone else will step in between?'. Yet again, that comment felt oddly specific.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph. This isn't excellent luck at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, fortune telling is still only fortune telling, so you shouldn't put too much faith into it. Let's tie it up over there."[1]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only if you put yours next to Yuika's, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki took the fortune from his Kouhai, she smiled a bit. Beside that, Keiki also put up Mao's terrible luck fortune. Right when they decided to check out the stalls, an incident happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… I can't anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Mao held her forehead and leaned against a nearby tree. "Nanjou? What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm feeling vertigo all of a sudden. All of the couples around us are starting to look like half-naked men to me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, that's the worst kind of hallucination you can possibly have." Keiki joked around, but it was true that she was looking awfully pale. "Mao-senpai, are you okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think so. I'm feeling really sleepy. It seems like I've reached my limit…" "That's what you get for going overboard."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not only did she finish her manuscript, she had also attended a local event to sell her newest release, participated in the FuyuComi, and even came back to the shrine without a break. All the exhaustion must have caught up with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you that you should have taken a day off." "But I wanted to go with everyone today…" "Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said this, and even Keiki didn't have anything to tell her otherwise. She might not say it out loud, but she could be pretty clingy at times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I guess you're right. I should be going home for today." "I'll go with her, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, please do."</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd be bad if she got washed away in this crowd, and since they'd be going to her room, sending Mizuha would be the best choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now's not the time, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, Mao and Mizuha walked down the path. Watching them, Keiki and Yuika were left alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess Nanjou's fortune turned out to be true." "Not to mention that it was really effective."</p>
<p class="null-p">It said that she'd collapse if she worked too hard, and it even happened on the first day of the new year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It seems like it's only the two of us now." Yuka muttered. "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai is nowhere to be found, so why don't we enjoy our time like it's a date?" Right after she said that, Yuika clung to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. This is much warmer, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to ruin your mood, but everyone's going to stare at us, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, everyone around had already directed their gazes towards the two lovebirds. And, in honest terms, it was pretty embarrassing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I was thinking this before when I stopped by your house, but you're getting really assertive as of late, aren't you? Even though you said you'd wait for my response."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika did say that, but she never said she wouldn't do anything in the meantime."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being the case-" Yuika still clung to Keiki's arm, and she put one finger on Keiki's nose. "So that you will choose her, Yuika will only get more aggressive from now on, so prepare yourself~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Do you finally understand? This is the destructive power that Koga Yuika possesses. The Kouhai who announced her desire to quit being a pervert is so cute that it's tough to handle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dear God, what should I do about this?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki asked, but alas, no answer came. That's when the angel and the devil on his shoulders made an appearance again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Evil Keiki-kun: "Why not just go out with Yuika-chan already?" Angelic Keiki-kun: "You can't. You have to think about it properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Evil Keiki-kun: "But this might be the last time you ever get confessed to by a</p>
<p class="null-p">girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">Angelic Keiki-kun: "That is true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Evil Keiki-kun: "She even said she'd stop being a pervert, so why not just go for it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Angelic Keiki-kun: That's true, a non-sadistic Yuika-chan is really cute, after all." Evil Keiki-kun: "And you'd get to do whatever you want with that cute Yuika-</p>
<p class="null-p">chan. Ain't that the best?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Angelic Keiki-kun: "…Yeah, it might be."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, the devil came out on top. Just as he said, the chances of Keiki being confessed to again after this is fairly close to zero. In that case, Yuika is very special.</p>
<p class="null-p">And I feel like we're a good fit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although not to the same number that Yuika does, Keiki reads books himself, and they're both more of the indoor type. On top of that, she offered to become a normal girl. There's no better reason that could tell Keiki to choose her. And yet he couldn't find an answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why do I feel so gloomy whenever I'm about to reach my answer?</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know why, but something made his chest tighten. He felt like he would regret giving a response without confirming this feeling. While he was lost in thought, he heard a cute 'Ding~' sound coming from his side, signaling an incoming call.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that was Yukka's phone." The girl took her smartphone out from the pouch she was holding, only to let out a shocked "Eh!?" after accepting the call. "Apologies, Senpai. Something urgent came up, so Yuika has to go home now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was a call from the rental shop. Yuika has forgotten to return a DVD, and if she doesn't bring it back this morning, she'll have to pay a late fee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it'd be best to avoid that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Depending on the establishment, that late fee could be quite high. Keiki himself had no experience with late fees, but he had heard that they could ask for up to 50,000 yen depending on the DVD and how late it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why not have your parents return it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… the contents of the DVD are something Yuika doesn't want her</p>
<p class="null-p">parents to see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see." Keiki nodded. "Something lewd." "Just a stimulating western movie!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That is what you call lewd, isn't it?</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway, Yuika will excuse herself for today!" "Ah, okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika dashed away in her kimono attire. After she had disappeared into the distance, Keiki muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan is a hidden pervert, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was quite excited at the sight of Mao's doujinshi, so she must be at that age.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, that fortune Yuika-chan pulled talked about someone bothering her… Was that it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mao, the fortune slips of the calligraphy club all turned out to be worryingly accurate, but that must be a coincidence. Fortune telling is just fortune telling. There's no way a piece of paper could have any sort of magical power like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki stood alone on the shrine grounds. "Now I'm all alone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had retired because of her exhaustion, Mizuha had followed her friend to ensure her safety, and Yuika had to leave early because of that urgent business. Even though the shrine grounds were filled with people, Keiki was all alone. He even ended up buying a chocolate banana out of boredom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I could never buy this with Nanjou around…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That fujoshi would definitely use this sort of thing as material for her doujinshi. "Still… just what is taking Sayuki-senpai so long?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She mentioned she'd arrive late, but Keiki couldn't find her anywhere. When he checked his phone, he hadn't missed a call or a message either. Nor did she respond to any his messages.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm? What's going on over there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the stall where they had just bought the fortune slips, a crowd of people had gathered. When he looked closer, a giant panel had been set up, and a big Japanese paper had been put on top of it. Next to it stood a bucket filled with</p>
<p class="null-p">black ink, and beside it was a giant brush nearly as tall as a small child. "Ahh, the new year's practice calligraphy writing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't exactly interested, but his eyes opened wide at the sight of the person who appeared next.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A black-haired girl showed up, wearing a white robe and red hakama. There were a few points that gathered attention, like her long black hair, or her breathtaking beauty, but the most prominent part of her was the girl's chest. Every time this priestess walked, her giant breasts shook left and right.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the self-proclaimed breast sommelier would not mistake these breasts. The person who appeared in front of the crowd was undoubtedly the club president of the calligraphy club, Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Sayuki-senpai here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been wondering why she wasn't coming, so he was only mildly confused at this sudden appearance. As her Kouhai watched over her, the priestess picked up the big brush in both her hands. She dipped the tip of brush into the bucket of ink, faced the paper, and started writing like she was stabbing the paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't hold back a voice of surprise when he saw how expertly the girl handled the brush despite its giant size. After a bit of time passed, the kanji for 'Fortune' had been written on the otherwise white paper. That's the kind of skill you expected from someone whose work made it big in a contest. Even an amateur could easily read the word written on the paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Sayuki put the brush back and bowed towards the audience, she received a round of applause. The girl smiled at this with a smile like an idol after a concert and headed back the way she came from.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki realized that he couldn't let her get away. He rushed through the audience and called out to her girl who was about to enter the shrine building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Ah, Keiki-kun. Happy New Year." "Happy New Year to you as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki exchanged another new year's greeting before asking his question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what are you doing here? I was really surprised to see you dressed as a priestess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you noticed? I was asked to help with this event." "Oh, you're helping out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Normally, it would have been the work of the Shinto priest, but he broke his hip. He requested someone from our family to stand in for him, since we're known for our calligraphy. But since my father is a shut-in, he told me that I had to do it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's why you were doing it."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what she meant when she said she had other business to attend to. "More importantly, what do you think? How do I look?" She spoke in a</p>
<p class="null-p">confident tone and spun in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"These priestess clothes look great on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, I see. That's what I expected to hear from the cosplay maniac Keiki-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">A priestess costume really hits the spot, huh?" "I'm not a cosplay maniac."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you like bunny girls and nurse cosplays, right?" "There is no boy on this green earth who dislikes them."</p>
<p class="null-p">A healthy boy should love all of them, so Keiki didn't feel embarrassed about it in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, are you the only one here, Keiki-kun? Where is everyone else?" "Ahh… Nanjou wasn't feeling too well, so Mizuha walked her home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, is she going to be fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The exhaustion from FuyuComi must have caught up with her, so she should be fine after getting a bit of sleep. And Yuika-chan had some urgent business come up, so she had to leave early as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm, really now…" Sayuki-san thought about it for a second. "So that means… you're free right now, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what it boils down to, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then could you join me for a bit after this?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I'm wearing a priestess outfit already, I might as well try out a new bondage technique, so I wondered if you could provide some support-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ask someone else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait. Don't go home. I was joking. Just joking." Sayuki grabbed Keiki's arm before he could walk away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing no other option, Keiki turned around with a sigh. "Consider the time and location before telling your jokes, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, you don't have to get so angry. Just wait a second for me to change." Sayuki gave her sulking Kouhai a wink and a warm smile. "Let's walk around the shrine together."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the shrine office's Japanese room, Sayuki took off her priestess clothes. She was now only wearing her underwear. Normally, this room was used for guests, but during events, the part-time priestesses could use this room to change. Since the room had a firewood stove, it wasn't cold by any means, but being naked in an unfamiliar place made Sayuki unable to relax, and she quickly donned her casual clothes. While she pulled her tights up over her legs, she thought about what Keiki had just told her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if Nanjou-san will be alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hopefully she had made it safely home with her escort. Sayuki was worried that she had worked herself to death after finishing her manuscript and attending those events. Though things should be fine since Mizuha was with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san went home with Nanjou-san, and Koga-san left early as well, so it's just the two of us now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she felt bad for seizing this chance, all is fair in love and war. Sayuki saw this as an opportunity to get closer with Keiki. Holding her fancy Western clothes to her chest, she steeled her resolve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is also a good chance to confirm it."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was something Sayuki had to find out. Namely, the details of the date between Kiryuu Keiki and Koga Yuika on Christmas Eve. Thanks to Mizuha's intelligence, she knew that they had been out fairly late. However, Keiki had never told anybody just what they did or how far they went, so Sayuki was very interested. She was too scared to ask him directly, in case he'd say something</p>
<p class="null-p">like 'We actually started dating~', so she had been agonizing over it this whole past week. She had to ask now or never, otherwise she might never find peace about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll definitely find out what you did with Koga-san…!"</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Around ten minutes passed since Keiki's upperclassman had gone to change. He was waiting outside when Sayuki came running towards Keiki, fully changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for waiting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have been in a hurry, as her cheeks were slightly reddened from the bit of exercise. She was wearing a gray knitted one-piece that reached down to her butt, along with black tights and a chester coat on top.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I had to report back to the Shinto priest." "It's fine. So what are we doing now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, I'd like to draw my fortune. They have the reputation of being oddly accurate here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I figured as much…" "What about you, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I already pulled mine. I got slightly good luck."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That kind of half-baked result suits you pretty well, Keiki-kun." "What exactly do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They exchanged casual banter, and Sayuki went to pull her fortune. "I wonder what my fortune will be this year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope it's better than mine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am the type of woman who can find ways to enjoy both terrible luck and great luck."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What meaning is there in it, then…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a positive mindset you wouldn't expect from a masochist, the girl opened her fortune slip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my…" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unbranded luck. It says 'Nothing perfect, but nothing awful.' But for romantic</p>
<p class="null-p">relationships, it says 'You will find mutual feelings with the person you love. You have the greatest compatibility'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that's pretty amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? I'll be happy to come to mutual feelings with Keiki-kun." "Huh, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed. You are my destined person after all, Keiki-kun." "D-Do you mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't plan on having any other master aside from Keiki-kun. Mutual feelings means that you'll accept me as your pet, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No it doesn't. Sigh, I knew this would happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had yet again wished for the girl to not say things with such double- edged meaning. Keiki almost mistook it for the romantic sense, but as always she had just meant it in the masochistic 'Make me your pet' sense. She doesn't want a wonderful boyfriend. What she really wants is a sadistic owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being the case, I would be a very happy pet if you could buy me some food."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is one crazy segue… but you worked hard for that drawing, so I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yay! I want some flour-based food!" "Yeah, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki walked towards the stalls with sparkling eyes, and Keiki showed a wry smile in response. Apparently, Keiki had to be careful with his wallet even on the first day of the year. Then again, Keiki himself wasn't quite satisfied with a chocolate banana, so he bought something, himself. They walked around the stalls for around ten minutes, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"We decided to eat something, and yet…" "There's nowhere to actually sit down and eat…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They had bought food and were carrying the plastic bags around, but all the tables and chairs were occupied by others, giving them nowhere to sit down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should we do? Should we go to the park nearby?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…" Sayuki thought about it for a second, only to let out a cute "Achoo!" in the process. "…It's a bit cold today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then do you want to come to my place? We have the kotatsu ready."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… Did you say…?" With an utterly baffled expression, Sayuki started at Keiki. "I'm going."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please let me visit your home!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so excited all of a sudden?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was a bit hesitant after seeing that reaction, but since he was the one who had invited her, he could hardly decline now. And that's how things were decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was around 1pm, and they were sitting in the living room of the Kiryuu Household. After taking off their coats, Keiki and Sayuki had entered the kotatsu and had fallen victim to the pleasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaa… kotatsus are the best…" "Right~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They had finished eating their lunch, filled their stomachs with yakisoba, takoyaki, and other various foods. Their bellies were satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really jealous of you, Keiki-kun. You had such a wonderful warming tool at your disposal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you have a kotatsu as well, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We do, but my mother prohibited me from using it since I would just loiter around all day. The one we used to use years ago is now buried somewhere covered in dust."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that your fault, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sound just like my mother, Keiki-kun~" The upperclassman said. A drowsy smile filled her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they spent a bit of leisure time like that, Sayuki sat upright and looked at her Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…By the way, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes~?" Keiki responded nonchalantly, only to regret it immediately. "Was your Christmas date with Koga-san fun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cough, cough!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This unexpected question caused Keiki to spit out the tea he had just sipped on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W…Why would you suddenly bring that up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no deeper meaning to it. I was just curious." "Uhhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"According to what I've heard, you enjoyed yourselves quite a bit, right? Koga- san sent me countless messages that day that made me think she was actually trying to harass me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About the aquarium, and about how you carried her like a princess." "T-That may have happened, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I heard from Mizuha-san that you came home fairly late. Were you really in the aquarium the whole time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-What are you trying to say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like he was in the middle of an interrogation. Did she find out about the confession? Keiki audibly gulped at the thought of that nightmare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope I'm wrong, but…" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You weren't taking a break with her, right?" "…Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki's mind turned blank. He thought he misheard that last part, so he tried to confirm it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… what do you mean by 'break'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about? I'm referring to having sex, of course." "Excuse me, but what are you talking about!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was Christmas Eve, right!? You all went on such a special date, and if there was the right atmosphere I wouldn't be surprised if you climbed the stairway to adulthood together! Weren't you indulging in some kind of satisfying S&M roleplay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, what the hell are you on about!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just the mere thought of that was ridiculous, not to mention the whole S&M thing afterwards. When Sayuki saw Keiki's reaction, her eyes opened wide in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, you really didn't do anything? On Christmas Eve? The day that gets all the boys and girls excited?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to act so surprised…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe you really aren't interested in girls after all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean 'after all'? I'm brimming with interest. The hell?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki would often oggle a good pair of breasts, his gaze always wandered towards miniskirts, and if he was allowed to, he would touch them as much as he could.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In other words, you're still a virgin, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's basically it, but if you say it to my face like that…" "So why did you come home so late, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, why? I want to know." "Well, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, it did snow that day, didn't it?" "D-Did it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Falling snow on Christmas is quite romantic, isn't it? It'd be a perfect time to confess your love, in my opinion."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…" "…Hey, Keiki-kun?" "W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't come home late because Koga-san confessed to you, right?" She spoke with a kind tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her smile emitted an insane amount of pressure, and made it look more terrifying than anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this? I feel like I'm about to be killed!</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's heart started racing. Sayuki was bringing him to the verge of revealing the truth. That being said, Keiki didn't want other people to know about Yuika's confession. Especially Sayuki, who held the top position in being bothersome when it came to that sort of thing. She's the kind of person who'd wrap herself in a giant ribbon and say 'I'm the present~'.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she found out about Yuika's confession, she would resort to measures Keiki didn't even want to imagine. If possible, Keiki didn't want to think about anything other than Yuika's confession itself. That being said, there was no other option but to cover it up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, that day, we got talking about 'Popular Urban Legends', so we</p>
<p class="null-p">stopped at a cafe and talked for hours."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that weird TV show, right? Koga-san seems like the kind of person who'd enjoy that. That makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was surprised more than anything that she had bought it. "…I was really worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Worried?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing… Fufu." "?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that it was nothing, but her cheeks looked oddly relaxed. Keiki was a bit confused, but was glad that the confession hadn't been found out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I feel much better now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment their conversation about that subject ended, Sayuki-san looked like a molten human as she sunk down onto the table with a smile. The sight of that was cute and funny at the same time, and Keiki couldn't hold back a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, would you like an orange?" "Please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll eat one as well." Keiki picked an orange out of the basket he had brought from the kitchen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, could you peel mine as well?" "Do it yourself, please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh? Keiki-kun, you're really starting to sound like my mother now." "You just act like a small child, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">They exchanged idle banter, and while Keiki was busy peeling an orange, their legs touched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the usual 'kotatsu happening'. However, because it happened with a girl outside his family, Keiki couldn't help but be embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you know…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't ever want to leave again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get you."</p>
<p class="null-p">The magic of a kotatsu is terrifying. A New Year's TV show ran on the TV, and they ate more and more oranges, and that was all they did. The kotatsu is something like a trap, not allowing you to leave ever again in case you dare set foot into one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I came up with the perfect method to escape the kotatsu." "And what is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I need to go to the bathroom." "Go ahead, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped…" The black-haired beauty grumbled as she forced her body upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, that's where the greatest event of the day occurred. Normally, Keiki would have watched Sayuki leave the living room, but three different misfortunate events overlapped, and thus a tragedy took place. The first misfortune was the fact that Sayuki's feet had fallen asleep after sitting this entire time. She didn't even notice until it was too late, and she immediately lost her balance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus follows the second misfortune, namely that Keiki was sitting in her way. Now that she had lost her balance, she fell directly towards Keiki, who raised his head in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As for the final misfortune, Tokihara Sayuki possessed a well-endowed chest. The moment Keiki looked up, he was greeted by two giant mountains falling down from the heavens.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Brea…sts…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the final word that came out of Keiki's mouth. "Hyaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mguh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't hold his balance after being hit in the face by Sayuki's full weight, and he fell flat on his back to the ground. The girl's chest pushed down on him. For an average girl, that wouldn't be too bad, but the volume of Sayuki's cleavage was special.</p>
<p class="null-p">Namely, they closed off Keiki's mouth and nose fully, cutting off all possible air supply.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki-senpai, move! I can't breathe!</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt the true danger for his life, and he tapped Sayuki's back several times. However, the situation was more grave than he had originally assumed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How troublesome. My legs have fallen asleep entirely, and now I can't move." "Gugh!?" Keiki made a plea for help that only sounded like a groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, he was about to lose consciousness.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Well, dying because of breasts I love so much isn't half bad, I guess…</p>
<p class="null-p">If he couldn't make it out alive, he at least decided to enjoy this sensation until his last moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Phew, I can finally move my legs again… Wait, Keiki-kun?" Far away, Keiki could hear Sayuki's worried voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah! Keiki-kun!? What happened!? Who did something cruel like this to you!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no one other than you. And the murder weapon was your breasts, Sayuki-san. Keiki tried to get out that dying message, but he couldn't muster up the strength to raise his voice, and instead just resigned himself to his fate.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">………Huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki opened his eyes, he found himself in his familiar living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh right. I went home and then breasts fell on my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had gone to take a trip to the bathroom, but had fallen over in the process, which had caused a breast attack against Keiki, which caused him to lose consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">But my head feels awfully light in comparison…</p>
<p class="null-p">It was light and warm, like something soft was hitting his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is… a lap pillow, isn't it?</p>
<p class="null-p">After that would probably be the part where Keiki asked himself who this lap belonged to. But of course, that answer was obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">These two mountains clearly belong to Sayuki-senpai.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hanging chest in front of Keiki's eyes could only belong to one person. Since he had received a lap pillow before, it felt all too familiar. Also, only one chest would be able to cover up the person's face like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">I know I should be getting up, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought about it for a second.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Well, I'll enjoy this a bit longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">He chose the second option just this once. It's not like you could ever grow</p>
<p class="null-p">tired of a beautiful girl's lap pillow, and since her breasts were the reason for this entire situation, it couldn't hurt to rest here a bit longer. Keiki closed his eyes again so that Sayuki wouldn't notice that he was awake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sheesh, who would lose consciousness because of breasts except Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She spoke in a slightly angry tone, and yet acted considerate of the Kouhai on her lap. Keiki felt the urge to point out the glaring flaw in her logic, but he had to keep quiet or Sayuki would find out that he was awake. If anything, though, she should be more careful not to kill others with that chest of hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's still sound asleep, though. Maybe he was tired?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm wide awake, actually.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This year passed by really quickly. We got more club members, went to the pool, went to the ocean, worked in a cafe during the culture festival… it was lots of fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah, that is true.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had enjoyed the calligraphy club atmosphere with just Sayuki, but the more people joined, the more noisy it got, and he looked forward to making his way there even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"On top of that, Keiki-kun sexually harassed me a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aaaand you just ruined it all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Personally, you're the best kind of pervert for me. You fondled my butt right below the crack."</p>
<p class="null-p">Did something like that happen?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that during their volunteer work earlier in the year? Keiki had used that weakness to stop the masochist from plaguing him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I went to the amusement park without wearing panties, and you even had to put them on for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that I remember it, that was awful.</p>
<p class="null-p">The no-panties date, the fact that she wore his underwear… all of these memories of her perverted tendencies came rushing back into his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Good grief, Sayuki-senpai is just…</p>
<p class="null-p">…A helpless pervert. But he still respected her. Even if she's a pervert, she's fun to be with, and that's her charm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But I could only have this much fun because I had Keiki-kun with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">…Hm?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe it's selfish of me to want to stay with Keiki-kun forever…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Eh? Sayuki-senpai…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe it's bad of me that I want to monopolize Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hold on, isn't this…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm relieved that nothing happened with you and Koga-san. If you started going out with her, you wouldn't have any more time for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't this something I definitely shouldn't be hearing!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started panicking, but Sayuki-san showed no signs of noticing. He was about to jump upright, but Sayuki's next words caused him to freeze in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki-kun?" The girl rubbed his head and called out his name. "I like you, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a grown-up tone, her words sounded sweet enough to melt any second.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">He heard the honest and most hidden feelings from that young maiden.</p>
<p class="null-p">Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh!?</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy had accidentally heard these words, and they left an even greater impact than being hit by the girl's breasts.</p>
Chapter 3: Do you like a big butt or a small butt?</p>
<p class="null-p">The short winter break came to an end, and the first day of the third school term arrived. During PE class in the 4th period, Keki was in the corner of the gym hall, dwelling in his thoughts while watching Shouma play basketball. Of course, the reason for this was Sayuki's words he had heard on the day of the first shrine visit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai… likes me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had totally missed his chance to 'wake up' from his fake slumber, and instead had acted like nothing happened. After the girl apologized for what had happened, she went home as well. She definitely shouldn't know that Keiki had heard her monologuing. But that didn't change the fact that he did hear her. And because of that, he'd been thinking about it nonstop ever since.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, Kiryuu-shi." "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki raised his head, he spotted Onizuka Megumi, who was wearing the same jersey as Keiki and waving at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Onizuka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm currently on the bench, so how about we talk a bit?" "I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Great. I'll sit next to you, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi sat next to Keiki, with a bit of distance between them. They hadn't talked ever since they met during the date at the aquarium. She was waiting for her own match to start, and when Keiki glanced over at the volleyball court, Mao had just landed a wonderful shot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-chan is so athletic. I'm really jealous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's the type of person who can do basically anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">She's good at playing games, she can swim, her drawings are even pro-level.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's the type of person who's loved by the gods.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akiyama-shi is also more of the sports type."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you ignore the fact that he's a lolicon, he's super handsome." "His girlfriend looks like a loli, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's a Senpai, but she's adorable at the same time."</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, Keiki was a bit leery of Koharu since she was such a stalker, but after he got to know her better, he held her in great respect.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Kiryuu-shi, are you thinking about something?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were just sighing all the time, so I was wondering." "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's probably why she had called out to him. "I can listen if you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki himself had come to a stalemate. An outsider's opinion might not be half bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">But bringing up the other people's names would be a bit…</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not that Keiki didn't trust Megumi, but Keiki wouldn't feel right just openly talking about other people's confessions.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll just use that manga cliché everyone always uses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is about a friend of mine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've read enough manga to know that you're talking about yourself." "Haha, no way. This really is about a friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, if you say so. I really like love talk, so give me something interesting." Megumi let out a sigh, and Keiki started his explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, there's this friend… let's call him K-kun. This K-kun was confessed to by a Kouhai of his last year on Christmas Eve."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A confession on Christmas Eve? Not bad, not bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, this K-kun is currently wondering how he should respond to that confession."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, the other day, K-kun happened to overhear a Senpai girl from his club saying that she likes him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew, that's a pretty abrupt development, isn't it?" Megumi's eyes lit when she heard this manga-like development. "I see, I see. So that Kouhai confessed to him, and how he also found out that his Senpai also holds positive affection towards him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what it boils down to." "Basically, it's a love triangle."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ironically, it used to be a pervert triangle. A triangle between Keiki, a Kouhai who wanted to make him her slave, and a Senpai who wanted to become his slave. Thanks to the development of romantic feelings on the behalf of the two girls, this abnormal relationship had changed into something different yet again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And now K-kun is lost as to what he should do." "Yeah, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"More than anything, he still doesn't know if his Senpai really holds romantic affection for him in the first place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, there's a lot of different kinds of 'like' in the world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki is a pervert who wants to be turned into a pet and humiliated. The word 'like' coming from her might be a different 'like' than a romantic one. That only left one possible solution of confirming it with the person herself. After hearing the circumstances, Megumi nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand the gist of it, so let me give you my analysis." "Please do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me start with the Kouhai." "Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If K-kun likes her, he can just go out with her, and if not, he can reject her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's pretty sound reasoning!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was so straightforward that Keiki himself was surprised. So much so that he couldn't even find a rebuttal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If anything, why is K-kun delaying his response? Is it that he doesn't like the girl who confessed to him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not the problem. She's genuinely cute. Actually, she's mega cute, and she even makes K-kun think that she's an angel. That's how cute she is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The heck is that? A lump of cuteness?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, that's not the reason why he's not giving her a response yet." "So…K-kun just doesn't like that girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki first saw Yuika, he thought that she was an unfriendly Kouhai. She wouldn't even smile. She'd basically ignore him if he talked to her. She wasn't social at all whatsoever. But Keiki couldn't help but be drawn towards the girl who was always sitting alone in the library room. He kept constantly talking to her, and she eventually warmed up to him. The first time Keiki saw her smile, he was really happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I never expected that she would stuff her panties in my mouth like that…</p>
<p class="null-p">She had turned out to be really perverted, and had inflicted a trauma upon Keiki that would probably never disappear. But he still couldn't help but think that she was cute. No matter what kind of devilish pranks she pulled off, Kieki would still forgive her. And thanks to her recent declaration that she wouldn't mind becoming a normal girl, she had stopped acting like a pervert altogether. If anything, she had become more cute after she stopped hiding her affection towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt happy when she smiled at him, and when they held hands, his heart would always race faster. He really felt like he was about to fall in love with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I think he likes her. But he's not sure if that emotion is romantic affection or not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds like an excuse from a boy who has no experience in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cruel! Even though you only recently got a boyfriend yourself, Onizuka- san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right~ Ever since we started dating, Nao-kun has been head over heels for me~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't need to hear you bragging right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, we were talking about K-kun." Megumi cleared her throat. "Well, if K-kun doesn't hate that person, he might as well go out with her and see how things work out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If K-kun were that heartless, he wouldn't have this much trouble." "Yeah, Kiryuu-shi doesn't seem like the kind of person who'd do that." "We're talking about my friend, remember?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, right, we're still going with that. It's completely obvious, you know." Megumi looked like she couldn't be bothered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to try dating her. I can't go into detail, but because that girl made such a serious confession, I want to seriously think this through, and give a resolute answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika said she wouldn't mind becoming a normal girl. That's why Keiki didn't want to give a half-baked answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, that sounds really complicated." "Yup, that it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">If he could make up his mind that easily, he wouldn't have so much trouble thinking about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'm glad." "About what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're acting like a real man and thinking about people important to you. It made me realize that you're a good person, Kiryuu-shi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san…" "-Ah, it's my turn."</p>
<p class="null-p">When they looked up, the girl's match had ended. Megumi got up and started to head over towards the court when she turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As for the Senpai, you should probably confirm her feelings first. It might just be a misunderstanding on your part."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… Wait, we're talking about a friend of mine, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to keep saying that." Megumi made an exasperated expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This seems difficult for Fujimoto-chan." These last words vice president Onizuka muttered didn't reach anybody's ears.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, once classes came to an end, Keiki made his way to the clubroom building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san's advice was completely correct, but confirming it with Sayuki- senpai sounds easier than it is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he could just ask her about it, he wouldn't be having this much trouble. The</p>
<p class="null-p">only way to bring it up would be to confess that he was pretending to be asleep when she said it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She probably said that because she thought I was sleeping…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way that Keiki could just say 'I was actually awake, tee hee~'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nor could he just ask 'Sayuki-senpai, do you actually like me?'.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I turn out to be wrong, it'd definitely be the worst part of my dark past ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">What would Keiki do if Sayuki responded with a nonchalant 'Huh? I don't, though.'? The hurdle for a boy to confirm a girl's feelings for them is way too hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm… What should I do about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without coming up with an answer, Keiki arrived at the clubroom. He opened the door and entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he stepped inside, he noticed something was off. "The heck is this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The door to the locker set up inside the room was open, and all the objects and private belongings of the club president had been taken out. On top of that, a girl's butt, covered in a blue skirt, stuck out from inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A butt!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Met with this unbelievable scene, Keiki had to look twice. However, the scene didn't change the next time he looked. What remained solidly in his field of view was definitely a girl's butt. Although Keiki couldn't see the underwear because of the skirt, the butt was still quite erotic to watch, and the bare legs showing between the skirt and socks held a great appeal. Keiki couldn't make out the upper body, but because of the skirt and butt, Keiki knew the owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it… Sayuki-senpai perhaps?" "That voice! Is that you, Keiki-kun!?" "I knew it was you, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face was buried deep in the locker, but the voice made it obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, don't! You can't, Keiki-kun! Don't use this chance to ravish my body as much as you want!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whaaat?! You won't?! You're not going to pull up my skirt, stare at my</p>
<p class="null-p">panties, and fondle my butt with your hands until you're satisfied?! …I mean, I love it when you purposefully ignore me, but why don't we go for something more stimulating this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of mood is this supposed to be?" Keiki felt stupid for worrying so much before coming here. "So what are you doing, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried to clean up, but then an avalanche happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you're stuck. I thought you were trying out some new kind of perverted roleplay or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, Keiki-kun? I seriously can't move right now, so could you help me?" "Yeah, yeah." Keiki would have felt bad leaving her like this, so he quickly went</p>
<p class="null-p">to help.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stood next to the girl and cleared away all the cleaning tools, documents, and other goods. After a few seconds, the work was done, and the black-haired beauty was freed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew. I felt like a mummy there." "Be more careful next time, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. You saved me." Sayuki stood up and gave her Kouhai a warm smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a surprise attack. It made him remember what happened on the day of the first shrine visit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was acting as weird as ever, but she was undoubtedly beautiful. She had great style and tall stature. Her long, glossy hair, white skin, and facial features all added to that beauty of hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she actually feels that way towards me?</p>
<p class="null-p">Could a beautiful girl like her really have feelings for an average Kouhai like Keiki?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I am Keiki-kun!" "…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki panicked and spoke his name like an NPC from some video game. "What's wrong? That's not like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really? I'm the same as alwaysh." "Alwaysh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" He bit his tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does that mean? Is that some new popular greeting?" "No, I just bit my tongue…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? You're acting a bit off today, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to hear that from the person who got stuck like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki managed to somewhat divert the topic. But that gloomy and hazy feeling inside Keiki's chest hadn't been cleared up so easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">My heart's beating like crazy, but Senpai is acting the same as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt a bit frustrated by that. Sayuki doesn't even know that Keiki had heard what she had said, and yet he was acting childish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my. Your face is a bit red, isn't it?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you have a fever or something?" "Wha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the second surprise attack of the day. Sayuki stood in front of Keiki and put her hand on his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm. It doesn't seem like you have a fever." "…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew. He knew that this action held no deeper meaning to it. She was just worried about her Kouhai. But knowing it in his head and accepting that with his feelings were two different things. The sensation of her palm on his forehead reminded him of the time she patted him on the head, along with her 'like', and his head burned up even more. Now that it had come to this, he had to confirm her feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry! I remembered something urgent, so I'm going home!" "Eh? …Ah, Keiki-kun!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was all too much for Keiki, and it made him run away. He grabbed his bag, ran past Sayuki, and dashed out of the room. At the same time-</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened to him? Rushing out like that…" The upperclassman who had</p>
<p class="null-p">been left behind stared after him in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After that day, Keiki started to avoid her. "Oh, Keiki-kun, good mor-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, I still have some homework left, so I'll excuse myself!" "Huh?! Keiki-kun?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the morning, when they ran into each other at the student entrance, Keiki ran away at full speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-kun, you're eating in the cafeteria as well-" "I'm sorry, a teacher called for me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait! You only ate a bite of your curry, though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki lied about the whole teacher thing and ran out of the cafeteria. "Ah, Keiki-kun! About the club today-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry! I have to watch an anime for girls that has a rerun going on right now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your excuses are getting worse and worse!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the third day after classes came to an end, Keiki grew tired and just came up with a random excuse. Once you make the choice to run away from someone, it requires an even greater amount of courage to face them again. Ever since Keiki ran away from Sayuki, just running into her made him feel embarrassed, and it turned into an endless spiral where he ran away the instant he spotted the girl. Of course, all her emails and messages were read and ignored.</p>
<p class="null-p">'What's wrong? Did I do something?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Why are you avoiding me? Do I smell?!'</p>
<p class="null-p">'If you don't respond, I'll become a priestess instead, okay?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'I think that leaving someone on 'read' without responding is pretty rude.'</p>
<p class="null-p">All these messages came in, but Keiki tried his best to ignore them. He felt scared all the same, especially since that last message sounded like she was seriously angry. Of course, since he kept acting this way, the people around him caught on to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, did something happen between you and Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the fourth day of him avoiding Sayuki, a Friday, Yuika asked that question while she was putting some returned books on the shelf. Of course, the person she asked was none other than the criminal Kiryuu Keiki himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nothing…at all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, you're really bad at lying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What about me makes you think that?!" "Literally everything. You're making it really obvious." "Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, could you bring Yuika that material over there?" "Yes…" Keiki took the book from the cart and handed it to Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put it in its proper place on the shelf and gave Keiki another dubious gaze. "Yuika can't help but feel worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Worried about what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whenever Keiki-senpai is with Witch-senpai, she always tries something indecent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay… Well, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But there's no need to hide that, right? Yuika knows about Witch-senpai's tastes. And you're still trying to cover it up. Doesn't that mean that something has happened that you can't even tell Yuika about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was sharp. It was a perfect conclusion. Although they didn't exactly do anything indecent.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't tell her, can I…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was still trying to think of his response to Yuika's confession. Even still, using the excuse that Sayuki might hold feelings for him as well would be too cruel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing is, when I went to the clubroom a while ago, Sayuki-senpai was stuck in a mountain of stuff and couldn't move her body."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, right, she was cleaning the locker." "You knew that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika helped her after that." "I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">That made explaining things more convenient.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And when I helped Sayuki-senpai there, I accidentally saw her panties." "Huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And she was wearing some really lewd ones. It made it a bit awkward." "Hmm? …Well it makes sense that Witch-senpai would wear nasty ones." "That's one horrible way to agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt guilty for making up a story like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then we can leave it at that. We still have work to do, so let's hurry and get this done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yessir~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki somewhat managed to avoid further investigation, and he focused on his work again. Since he'd been doing this for nearly two years now, he was used to the work, allowing him to know where to put a book just by looking at it. Right when he was making good progress, and put the final few books away-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oops…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki leaned over to pick up a book from the bottom of the basket, a pen fell out of his chest pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The pen rolled deeper into the rows of bookshelves.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where do you plan on going?" Keiki walked after the pen, his waist lowered. "Alright, I've finally got you."</p>
<p class="null-p">He grabbed his beloved pen and raised his head. "Mfugh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Something soft hit the front of his face, and Yuika let out a shriek at roughly the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki separated his face from the uncertain something, he found a familiar fabric.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ke… Keiki-senpai?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he lifted his gaze, Keiki was greeted by a beet red face. Said face</p>
<p class="null-p">belonged to Yuika. Her body shook as she pulled the green fabric-namely, her skirt-downwards, and Keiki realized the crime he had committed. Indeed, he had shoved his face right onto Yuika-chan's butt.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Um, it's not what it looks like, Yuika-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph…" Yuika glared at him, while holding her skirt down.</p>
<p class="null-p">The second Keiki saw that face, all the blood drained from his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is seriously bad!</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he didn't do it intentionally, he had still pushed his face right onto her behind. No matter what excuse he might make, it was undoubtedly sexual harassment. On top of that, since the victim was the sadistic Yuika, Keiki won't get away that easily. If anything, she'd probably step on his head after tying him up, saying 'Ahaha, a slave candidate like you has the nerve to touch your master?'-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…" "Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes." Keiki obliged without a second's hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the heater was working just fine, the floor seemed cold nonetheless. "Yuika will listen to any excuses you may have."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My pen fell out of my pocket, and when I was chasing it down, I ended up bumping into your behind. I am very sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? You wanted to touch Yuika's butt so badly that you would make up an excuse like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you come to that conclusion!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you're saying that you're not a pervert who is greatly interested in girls' butts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not in a million years. I would never want to be regarded as such a pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki did not dislike a good bum, but he decided to keep silent about that or things would get more complicated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Then do you not have any interest in Yuika's butt?" "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's Senpai, Yuika wouldn't mind too much if you touched it." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's nothing! Yuika didn't say anything! Because Yuika isn't a perverted girl!" Yuika-san retracted her previous words and frantically waved her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…" Keiki read the mood and decided to not press her on it any further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… it's fine. Just be more careful in the future, okay?" "Eh, that's all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you dissatisfied?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you were going to insult me, and step on me, and that sort of thing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wouldn't, because Yuika is a normal girl right now. The sadistic Yuika has been locked away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was their current agreement. In order for Keiki to develop feelings for the girl, Yuika had said that she would act like a normal girl. The moment Keiki heard that, he should have felt happy and accepted her feelings right away. So why…?</p>
<p class="null-p">My chest feels weird again. What is this gloomy feeling?</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time Yuika denied her true self, Keiki felt something sharp stab his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">But he was still lost as to what this unfamiliar feeling could be. "-Ah, an email from Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"From Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was freed from the lecture, and Yuika told him the contents of the email as he stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai says that she has some business after school, so club is cancelled."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because Keiki-kun isn't giving me any attention, I'll drown my sorrows in alcohol! But, since I can't drink alcohol, I'll make do with tapioca milk tea-is what she said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Drown her sorrows… She is still taking her entrance exams, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That girl is unbelievable. She talks about how much she likes someone when they're right in front of her, gets buried in trash while trying to tidy up the locker with her butt sticking out in the open…</p>
<p class="null-p">…Huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was thinking about that, Keiki realized something was off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was Sayuki-senpai cleaning the locker anyway?</p>
<p class="null-p">They had already cleaned the clubroom before the start of winter break. And Sayuki was never the type of person to clean. But before Keiki could finish his thoughts, the bell rang, signaling the end of lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">That very day marked the end of Keiki's constant running away. "You finally came. I've grown tired of waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki finished his cleaning duty in the classroom and quickly made his way to the shoe lockers at the front entrance. Tokihara Sayuki was already there, waiting for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you here, Senpai? Didn't you have some business to attend to?" "Hee hee. I just fed Koga-san some false information. If I had told you directly,</p>
<p class="null-p">you probably wouldn't have believed me, so I used that girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh lord…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's head felt dizzy. Sayuki might be a masochist, but she apparently was the type of person to learn things quickly. She knew that Keiki was together with Yuika for the library committee during lunch break, so she used that to spread false information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hate beating around the bush, so let's get to the main deal point away." Sayuki ran her fingers through her long hair as she approached Keiki. "Why are you avoiding me? Is there some special reason?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What might you be referring to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't play dumb now. You used to love me so much that you were constantly clinging to me, and now you've been avoiding me for the past few days. Of course I know that something's off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like part of that is totally made up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't remember being that clingy. If anything, the girl was the one who was always acting clingy towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was worried that my body odor was unbearable or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If anything, you smell really nice, so you don't have to worry about that." "Then why have you been avoiding me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…" There was no way he could tell her.</p>
<p class="null-p">How could he say he was avoiding her because he had grown too conscious of her? That's a reason only a grade school student in their adolescence would make. That being said, there was only one way to escape this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Au revoir!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took a sharp right and ran away. Indeed, the cornered Kouhai boy once again decided to run away from his big-breasted follower.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Hey! Why are you running away again!?" "Even I don't know anymore!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation only grew more confusing. Keiki didn't know why he was running away, nor why Sayuki said something like that. Keiki felt scared to know his feelings, or her feelings, but he couldn't bring himself to face them, so the only escape he could see was to run from her. But this time, the black-haired upperclassman didn't let up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey! Stop already!" "I refuse!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not letting you escape today!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you think you can catch me, then go ahead and try!"</p>
<p class="null-p">During both the culture festival and his work for the student council, Keiki had gained a lot of endurance. Compared to that, Sayuki was hopeless when it came to athletic abilities. The difference here was clear as day, so she shouldn't be able to catch up with Keiki anytime soon. As things stood, the distance between them didn't show any signs of shrinking. On top of that, thanks to Sayuki's well- endowed chest, it didn't take long for her to be out of breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… haaah… Wait a second… Wait… Kyaaa!?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki heard a shriek from behind him, which made him stop in his tracks. When he turned around, he saw that Sayuki had fallen head-first into the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Auuu…" "Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki completely forgot that he should be running away, and instead called out to Sayuki, who was glued to the ground like a piece of chewing gum.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai!? Are you okay!?" "I'm obviously not…" "Right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The impact must have hurt quite a bit. "Are you injured anywhere?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My nose hurts…" "Yeah, it looks red." "Could you help me up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood." Keiki grabbed Sayuki's hand, pulling up her body. "Can you stand on your own?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I should be fine now."</p>
<p class="null-p">As far as Keiki could tell, she wasn't hurt aside from her nose. When Keiki saw that, he let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for helping me up. And that's it, Keiki-kun." "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've caught you!" "Ah! Oh no!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the brief moment when Keiki let down his guard, Sayuki reached out for him with her hands. With a dull banging sound, the girl's hand was slammed against the wall behind Keiki, leaving him no room to escape. Of course, Keiki knew exactly what this skill was called.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A reverse wall-slam…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever a boy does this to a girl, you call it a 'Wall-slam', but when the opposite happens, and the girl becomes the assertive one, it's a 'reverse wall- slam', or so Keiki had heard. Sayuki must have been thinking of this back when she tripped. Specifically she had made him drop his guard, and had used this chance against him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh heh, this is the result of my hard labor!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me, but you're too close. Your chest is hitting me…" "Who cares about that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, they're hitting me quite a bit." "Shouldn't you be happy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I'm delighted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, you won't be able to run away anymore." "…It seems like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a big chest in front of him, and to his back was a wall. To his left and right were two arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why did you run away again?" "That's… Um…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it some kind of abandonment roleplay? Sorry, but I'm not in the mood for it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never intended for such a roleplay to happen." "Then stop running away already!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai…?" Keiki was surprised by the loud voice that Sayuki let out.</p>
<p class="null-p">This might have been the first time he had seen his Senpai so agitated. The two of them were at a distance close enough to touch each other, and from this close distance the girl made a distressed face as she dropped her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being avoided by Keiki-kun… makes me feel really lonely…" "Huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm about to graduate. So we won't be able to spend as much time together…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki heard that, he realized something. He had been ignoring the inevitable future. Tokihara Sayuki is a third-year student. That means she's going to graduate from this school soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see. That's why she was tidying up the locker…</p>
<p class="null-p">She was most likely trying to clean up as much as she could. Once February arrives, all the third years would be free from school, so she'd be retiring from the club as well. Even though Sayuki had treasured her time in the calligraphy club until the very end, Keiki tried to distance himself from her. He only needed to look at the tears in her eyes to realize how much that had hurt her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had only thought about himself, without even bothering to consider her</p>
<p class="null-p">feelings. He couldn't have done anything worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I do something to make you angry, Keiki-kun?" "No. You're not the one who's at fault, Senpai." "Then why were you avoiding me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my fault. I made things awkward myself…" "Awkward?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wouldn't be able to hide it any longer. And he didn't want to. He didn't want to betray his Senpai's feelings anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During the day of the first shrine visit, you came to my place, right?" "Indeed. We sat under the kotatsu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I lost consciousness because of your breasts." "I'm still sorry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"After that, you gave me a lap pillow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I thought your head would hurt if you left it on the floor." "During that time, I actually woke up midway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?" Sayuki's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I woke up fairly quickly, but I enjoyed your lap pillow so much that I pretended I was sleeping."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, wait? Hold on. This is too much to take in. So basically you were awake the whole time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I was just pretending to be asleep." "So that means…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kouhai she had assumed to be asleep was actually wide awake. When it dawned on Sayuki what that meant, her face turned beet red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You heard everything I said?" "…Basically, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How could this happen!?" Sayuki hid her face with both her hands. "I want to crawl into a hole and die."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I figured as much." Keiki would have reacted the same way if he were in her position. "I'm sorry for lying to you. But don't worry, I won't have any weird misunderstandings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Misunderstandings like what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Knowing Senpai, you must have been talking about a master and servant relationship. That you like your owner. I almost got the wrong idea that you actually had feelings for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's not a misunderstanding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…?" Keiki's gaze shot to Sayuki, who spoke with a sulking tone. "It wasn't… a misunderstanding…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you mean…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw his Senpai's moist eyes, Keiki felt his heartbeat accelerate. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were both blushing, and a sweet atmosphere clung to the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, a crowd started to form around them. "-Hey, look at them. Is someone going to confess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-A lover's quarrel? Just watching them makes my heart race." "-Calm down. They'll notice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to their loud conversation, people gathered around, watching them from the doors of the classrooms or corners of the hallways. To them, it looked like Keiki and Sayuki were a couple in the middle of a lover's quarrel. Feeling uncomfortable, Sayuki whispered to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Let's go somewhere else." "…Yes, let's."</p>
<p class="null-p">They chose the calligraphy clubroom for a calmer location. Since Sayuki had announced that the club was on break, nobody was there. Sayuki turned on the switch to the stove, stood with her back to the window, and crossed her arms with a displeased 'Hmph'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that bad?" She asked. "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it bad that I like you, Keiki-kun!?" "Are you getting angry at me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I am! I love you, Keiki-kun! I want you to hug me! I always look at pictures of you until I fall asleep, and I want to be lovey-dovey with you! I'm sorry for feeling this way!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry, it all rushed to my head." "A bit, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was trying to hide my embarrassment, so just forget about it." Her face was still red like before, so she must have really been trying to hide her embarrassment. "Still, I didn't think that you actually were awake back there, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really sorry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. To be honest, I've been worried ever since you went on that date with Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Worried about what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that Koga-san might get swept along in the atmosphere, confess to you, and you'd start dating right away. Well, I'm glad that it was just me thinking too deeply into it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ahaha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, Sayuki wouldn't be more correct about the confession. But Keiki somehow managed to cover it up on the day of the first shrine visit, and he decided to take that secret to the grave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought about it a lot back then. I realized I didn't want Keiki-kun to be taken away by her. That I wanted to be the one next to you, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why all my feelings just came gushing out when I gave you that lap pillow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's what that was."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I like you more than you might think. When you called out to me, right before the club would have been disbanded, and showed up every day in the room… I've liked you ever since then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every single word the girl said sent warm and passionate shivers down into Keiki's heart. There was no way Keiki would be able to stay calm if a girl he knew so well used words such as 'like' or 'love' when talking to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. You're turning red, Keiki-kun." "Whose fault do you think that is?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. I really never get tired of you, Keiki-kun." Sayuki snickered in a teasing</p>
<p class="null-p">tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her smile was so radiant that Keiki couldn't complain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And this is just like you, Keiki-kun. I tried to win you over and show you so many times, but you never realized."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no, there's no way I would have. You always talked about wanting to become my pet or wanting me to become your master, so I never would have thought you felt this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki wasn't so arrogant as to just blindly assume that she held romantic feelings for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Think this through, will you? There's no girl who would want a boy she doesn't even like to become her master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A normal girl wouldn't want to become someone else's pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">In this case, Tokihara Sayuki's fetish made things too complicated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really think that you have the talent to become a sadist, Keiki-kun." "That's not exactly a compliment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd probably be very happy if you became my master. You'd treat me well every day, using both belt and candy to make me feel blessed and excited at the same time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't want to imagine that kind of thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But there are times when I wouldn't mind forgetting all of that." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not going to give up on becoming a pet, you know? But there's no meaning to staying thickheaded if the person I like ends up hating me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to be even closer with Keiki-kun. And for that, I wouldn't mind forgetting about the master and pet relationship. As long as you keep me at your side, I can give up on being a pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, do you mean…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded almost identical to what Yuika had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, if possible…" Inside the empty calligraphy clubroom, filled with memories, the girl made her second confession. "…Please make me your girlfriend."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_12.jpg">
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: The First Pervert</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, Keiki sat on his bed, thinking about the incident that had happened a few hours prior.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai confessed to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was caught by surprise on his way home, driven into a corner, avoided the crowd, and finally heard the girl's true feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She even said she didn't need the response right away…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was already having trouble thinking of a response for Yuika, and now a second confession had surfaced. Naturally, that meant that Keiki had to think about the response for that as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How do I feel about Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the Senpai who Keiki had always admired. She had good grades, was very skilled in calligraphy, and the sight of her painting with her brush had robbed Keiki of his breath several times. At the same time, he found her cute. How she could be clumsy at times, how she pouted now and again, how she could act childish… He liked all of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the instant I found out she's a hardcore masochist, that image of a perfect Senpai was ruined…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought back to his Senpai's fall from grace, as she held that red dog collar in her hand, pushing the leash towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Please make me your pet,' she said. What a horrible line to hear from a Senpai you admire." Keiki laid face-up on his bed, thinking back to that time. "She was the very first pervert I met, wasn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since Keiki had started searching for Cinderella, Tokihara Sayuki was the first pervert he had encountered. And she was one of the more extreme ones as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She wants to be my pet, she wants to go on a walk like she's a dog… Honestly, I got a headache every time she asked for that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They went on a date to the amusement park, only for him to find out she wasn't wearing any panties. She had worn underwear she had stolen from Keiki's room. She was constantly acting like a pervert. But when Keiki had to make a choice between the student council with Ayano and the calligraphy club, Keiki chose the latter. The student council was a comfortable place, thanks to Shiho's kind leadership. Ayano was a comfortable classmate, and there were other cute Kouhais. And yet Keiki had decided to return to the calligraphy club. Because he didn't want to move away from the place where he had spent more than a year together with the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do I… actually like Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that Keiki liked Tokihara Sayuki as a person. But if you asked him if this was romantic affection, Keiki had no confidence in his answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both Yuika-chan and Sayuki-senpai said they'd stop being perverts, so I just have to figure out my own feelings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had planned on removing the perverted attribute from the girls in the calligraphy club, and ultimately wanted to get a girlfriend in the process, but he wouldn't have imagined that those same perverts would actually confess to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Angelic Keiki-kun: "Basically, their attributes don't have anything to do with your choice, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Evil Keiki-kun: "It's about who you like more, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Angelic Keiki-kun: "No, no, no. There's also the choice where you don't pick anybody."</p>
<p class="null-p">Evil Keiki-kun: "Or go out with both of them at the same time?" Angelic Keiki-kun: "You can't two-time like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Evil Keiki-kun: "But, I want a cute girlfriend~" Angelic Keiki-kun: "Yeah, that~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet again, the angel and devil inside Keiki came to an agreement. Of course, Keiki wanted a girlfriend. He's a healthy high school boy. Should he choose the cheerful and cute younger Koga Yuika, or should he choose the beautiful and enjoyable Onee-san Tokihara Sayuki? Or should he continue to protect his chastity and choose neither?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I do about this?" "…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice suddenly responded to Keiki's outburst, and he realized that the door was half-open, with his little sister Mizuha taking a peek inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't tell me she heard that?!</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd be bad if this exhibitionistic girl had found out about the two confessions. Mizuha might look calm on the inside, but if things go south, she's one of the first who'd go crazy. She might actually target her Onii-chan's chastity at this rate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never knew Nii-san was agonizing about it this much." "I-It's not that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I totally get it." "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're debating between if you want to invade your little sister's bath or sniff her underwear first, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of hellish choices are those?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Personally, I'd love it if you could sniff my panties while watching me take a shower."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That'd make me an awful pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hoped to high heaven that no such older brother existed in this world. "Then what are you so troubled about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…" Keiki thought about it for a while. "I was wondering which is better: Big breasts or small breasts." He came up with the worst possible response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And your conclusion is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't compare them. Everyone has their own taste."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a mediocre conclusion. The bath is free, by the way, so you can take yours next."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I will gladly do so." Keiki felt like he had lost something very important, but he still felt happy that he had managed to hide it from Mizuha. While putting the thinking about confessions on hold, Keiki enjoyed his bath.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sup, Kiryuu." "Ohh, Nanjou. Sup!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next Monday morning, when Keiki opened his shoe box, Mao called out to him. She was wearing a coat on top of her uniform, with her school bag hanging down from her shoulder as she took out her slippers from the shoebox. After they both finished changing shoes, they headed to the classroom together. Mao spoke up in a nonchalant tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That reminds me." "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it true that you had a lover's quarrel with the club prez last week?" "…How do you know about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she was talking about that reverse wall-slam. Keiki had assumed that none of the calligraphy club members were present, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megumi sent me an email." "It was Onizuka-san, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the student council's vice president for you. The news had reached her quite quickly. Then again, it wouldn't have taken long for rumors to spread.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that the club prez pulled a reverse wall-slam on you? And you looked like you were really enjoying it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… not true…" "Clearly not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, her breasts were basically rubbing against me." "Woah, Kiryuu, you're a total pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to hear that from a BL doujinshi artist."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the kind of pervert who'd fantasize about boys and men from around her mingling with each other. Keiki felt he was much better off mentally than a BL manga. And while they were talking back and forth about perverts, they made their way up the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, you'd been avoiding the club prez as of late, right?" "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did that get resolved?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess, but another problem appeared in the process?" "What kind of problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, it's a bit complicated…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like Mizuha, Mao was a pervert who was targeting Keiki (and the material he could provide her). He wanted to avoid leaking the fact that he had been confessed to. But what were the right words to say here?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You're always hiding something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?" Keiki turned around. There, he saw Mao standing still on the stairs. She directed her obviously-displeased gaze up towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When a man is hiding something, it's usually because he's cheating, isn't it?" "What are you talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just doubting you. I'm wondering if you threw Akiyama away to take the club prez."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just for the record, I've never once gone out with Shouma, nor do I have any plans to do so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Where did that even come from?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then there's nothing going on between the club prez and you?" "Y-Yeah, nothing at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you say, but knowing you, you probably got cornered by her and your thing grew huge."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously what are you talking about?!" That was a really dirty joke, even for Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You cheater! Keeki should only have eyes for Shouto!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, is this what I think it is?! You were working on your manuscript all night, weren't you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sure was! What of it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That explained a lot. This side-tail girl had worked on her manuscript until early morning. Since Mao was skilled at putting on make-up, Keiki couldn't tell right away, but now that he looked closer, he could see bags beneath her eyes. She must be suffering from a lack of sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go to the infirmary." "The infirmary?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, we'll go ask Tachibana-sensei to give you a bed." "I don't think it's good to skip classes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When did you turn into such a diligent person? There's no way you can take</p>
<p class="null-p">classes seriously like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine, then. I'll take a nap if you sleep with me." "No, I won't. What are you talking about?" "Hmph. So stingy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of cute face are you trying to make? Stop pouting."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw his classmate puff her cheeks, Keiki's heart tightened. Nanjou- san might just be the type of person to end up acting like a spoiled kid. At the same time, that just showed how tired she must be, which was why Keiki took her hand and led her to the infirmary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can go by myself. We don't have to hold hands."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And who was it that almost collapsed on the day of the shrine visit?" "Now that you mention it, I don't have anything to rebut that with…" "See? Let's go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao stopped resisting and started just following Keiki silently. "Good grief, why do you have to work so hard?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She'd been totally out of it during the shrine visit as well. Why had she been going overboard so much as of late? Offering every part of yourself for something you like is a good thing, but Keiki felt worried that she would break down from the exhaustion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Does Keiki like the club prez?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was leading Mao to the infirmary, Keiki heard something quiet muttered behind him, but because of all the confusion and stress as of late, he decided to ignore it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once school came to an end, Keiki made his way to the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work today~" He gave a brief greeting as he entered inside. He spotted Sayuki sitting on the tatami mats, greeting him with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-kun. Good work today." "H-Hello, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">The confession came to Keiki's mind again, making him feel slightly embarrassed. Trying to hide it, he headed over to his usual spot and put down his bag. Right when he sat down on the folding chair, he remembered what he was</p>
<p class="null-p">supposed to share.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, right. Nanjou isn't coming today." "Oh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she's still pretty busy."</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking a rest in the morning, Mao went to her classes in the afternoon. She told Keiki 'I'm working on my manuscript, so I'm going home' and left the classroom before anyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Mizuha said she has cleaning duty, so she'll probably be late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… Oh right, Koga-san mentioned she went over to the library office today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh really? That sounds like her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, it's just the two of us until Mizuha-san shows up, isn't it~?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, Keiki~~~kun!" "Woah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a surprise attack. Sayuki suddenly appeared behind Keiki, embracing him from behind. Her hands wrapped around his neck and started tickling his chest. At the same time, her well-endowed chest sent a warm sensation down his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?! What are you doing?!" "Hmm? I'm just showing you my love for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In this position, your something else is showing something else entirely!" "I'm just using my womanly weapons. It'd be a waste not to use them." "You don't have to act all calculating now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, the breasts held no sin. And no boy would hate this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">It pains me to say it, but I guess I should just let this happen…</p>
<p class="null-p">All his skinship so far with Sayuki was related to her own masochistic desires. And what is this current situation? A beautiful, big-breasted Senpai of his was embracing Keiki from behind. She had her arms around the boy's neck, and her soft breasts were pressing against his back. A sweet scent drifted over from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is this not the perfect situation I've always dreamed of?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki wasn't the most assertive boy out there, but that didn't mean</p>
<p class="null-p">he never wanted something like this to happen. Of course, he had always hoped for a destined encounter with an unfamiliar and cute girl, but he'll gladly take the same with an older Onee-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it? Do you… dislike this type of girl?" "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">How could he hate that? Compared to Yuika's childish and spoiled attitude, Sayuki used her entire body to show him affection, making her seem cute in her own way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you made me your girlfriend, I'll do something even better for you." "Something even better?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For example… a sandwich?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of sandwich are we talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. I'll leave that up to your imagination." Sayuki snickered. "By the way, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy you came to the clubroom today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I would… after what you said yesterday…"</p>
<p class="null-p">How she felt sad being avoided, and the face she made. Keiki couldn't just stay away after seeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. I really like that about you, Keiki-kun." "Ugh… you really throw a straight ball, don't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That sort of move held the highest destructive power, so Kieki would have appreciated it if she could dial it down a bit. Not to mention that Keiki had reached his limit with the soft sensation against his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-It's fine now, right? Could you let go now?" "No can do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because… if you look over here now, you'll see how red I am…" "Huuuh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki-san said something like a true maiden in love. She had apparently gotten flustered after saying 'like' and 'love' and all that. After that, the girl's mouth didn't open again, but feeling the racing heartbeat hitting his back made Keiki's heart race also.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was Sayuki-senpai always this cute?</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how grown-up she might look, she was still an adolescent girl on the inside. She'd get hurt if you avoided her, and she'd get flustered if she's revealing her true emotions. Now that Keiki understood that, his face started to burn up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why are you flirting around in broad daylight like this?" "Huh? …Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">How long had she been there? With the closed door behind her, Yuika sent an ice cold gaze directly towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, if it isn't Koga-san. Welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Witch-senpai, aren't you closer to Keiki-senpai than usual?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just your imagination. Maybe your eyes have gone bad, Koga-san." "What did you say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Another battle started not even ten seconds after they ran into each other. "For now, get away from Keiki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to. Nor do I think you have any right to tell me what to do." "Hmph…" After her request was flat-out denied, Yuika puffed out her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say that, then Yuika has her own idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without answering Sayuki's question, Yuika put down her bag and moved in front of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She clung to him from the front. Her small body pushed right against Keiki, leaving no gap between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hee, hee. Now we're even." Her victorious smile was cute. So cute that Keiki couldn't even get angry at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me, Koga-san, but you could maybe move away? I was the first one who caught Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Unless Witch-senpai moves away, Yuika won't." "Then I won't let go unless you do, Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, but we can't stay like this forever, you know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was getting close to his limit. Both Sayuki and Yuika's behavior hadn't changed even after they stopped acting like perverts. Keiki realized that he couldn't do anything about this, so resigned himself to this fate and closed his eyes. With Sayuki at his back and Yuika had his front, he had no option of moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this the sandwich she was talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surrounded by big and small breasts, Keiki couldn't do anything but sit back and enjoy it until Mizuha came back from cleaning duty.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh. A sandwich from Tokihara-senpai and Koga-san. Aren't you a lucky boy?" "Honestly, it wasn't half bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tuesday came around, and after classes came to an end, Shouma and Keiki sat by the window in an otherwise empty classroom, talking about this and that. Shouma had known about the perverts for a long time, and now that he had a girlfriend of his own, he was always Keiki's number one advice-giver.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That aside, you sure are greedy, Keiki. Getting confessed to by two girls? If the boys found out, they'd plot an assassination against you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think so, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what's your plan of attack now, Keiki?" "To be honest, I'm at a loss."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will you choose big breasts or small breasts? It's an endless debate." "No, I'm not hesitating because of the size here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it were me, I'd take small ones in a heartbeat." "I wouldn't have expected any less from a lolicon."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Keiki had asked the wrong person for advice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really am at a loss. I've been thinking about it for quite some time now, but I can't come up with an answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since the two of them said they like me, I want to seriously think this through, but the more I think about it, the worse it gets."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like or hate. Pervert or no pervert. All of these things were jumbled together, hiding the answer he should be looking for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe you just don't want to hurt anyone, Keiki?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a kind person, after all. You don't want anybody to cry, and maybe that's why you can't find your answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not wanting to hurt anybody. Not wanting anybody to cry… That truly was something Keiki was always thinking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… might be true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he had to guess, Shouma was probably speaking the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I might be scared. Scared that by finding my own answer, or by choosing someone, that I might hurt someone else in the process."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Keiki might just lack the courage to choose a single girl. Even if he were to choose someone, someone else would be hurt. Someone else would cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you stop doing things for someone else's sake, and just act according to your own desires?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Think about who you're the happiest to be around. Maybe then you'll find an answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had never thought about it that way. He had only ever focused on the other person, completely disregarding his own feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was only thinking about what kind of answer I'd give the two of them." "That's the good part about you. And that's why I want you to be happy,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why? Even though Shouma had said something so moving and gratifying, Keiki felt more relieved than anything as he thought I'm glad Nanjou isn't here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks. I'll try to think about myself some more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. Whatever choice you take, I'll be there to support you, Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to this conversation, Keiki started to feel like he was seeing the light.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was glad that he decided to talk to Shouma, after all. "Still, it finally happened, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both Koga-san and Tokihara-senpai had been giving off a lovey-dovey atmosphere whenever you were around. It was just a matter of time until they confessed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the first Keiki had heard of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then again, I didn't expect both of them to go for it at the same time." "Why didn't you just tell me, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be too unsophisticated, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That it would be. If Keiki were in his position, he probably would have done the same. As the conversation calmed down a bit, Shouma flashed a relaxed smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder which princess will capture Keiki's heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki accompanied Shouma down the hallway towards his club. He spotted two familiar silhouettes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Isn't that… Rintarou and Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Oddly enough, Rintarou was wearing the male uniform, and facing him stood Mizuha, wearing a coat over her uniform. Judging from the situation in front of him, Keiki guessed that Rintarou must have called out to Mizuha in the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a rare match to see." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha and Rintarou had met each other before. On top of that, Keiki remembered his conversation with Rintarou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what he said during the shrine visit was true…" "What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou said he was planning on going on the offensive with Mizuha?" "Really? Mitani-kun and Mizuha-chan, huh~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder what they're talking about. Mizuha-chan looks like she's enjoying herself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't pick up what exactly they were talking about, but since Mizuha was grinning, it couldn't be anything like the usual sexual harassment that</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou loved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And why are you making such a complicated expression, Keiki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know. It feels like I'm a father who's about to have his precious daughter stolen away from him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, right. I forgot you're a total siscon." "Am I really that much of a siscon?" "Indeed you are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, if he was a siscon, then it couldn't be helped. And since he was such a siscon, seeing his precious little sister talk with another boy would make him agitated, and of course he would feel the desire to break between the two right away.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, a heavy atmosphere reigned in the student council office. Sitting around the large table were the members of the student council: Fujimoto Ayano, Onizuka Megumi, Nagase Airi, and Mitani Rin (in girl's clothing).</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a grave situation. If you compare it to last year, we're in an even more unfavorable condition." The vice president Megumi looked at the documents at hand as she said this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In terms of numbers, the difference is about 5%, but if this continues on for every year the school will be in big trouble eventually." The treasurer Airi gave more accurate numbers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means we have to come up with a better strategy. It isn't something we have to prioritize right away… but what do you think, Ayanon-senpai?" The secretary Rinko directed his gaze over towards the student council president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm…" Ayano thought about it for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">It hadn't been very long since she had been elected the student council president, but she still had to make a choice beneficial to everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's something we cannot ignore as the student council, so let's try our best at it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, no objections." Megumi gave her consent, and Airi and Rinko nodded along as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this, Ayano flashed a tender smile and gave her conclusion. "Alright, then. Airi, could you take care of this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave it to me, Ayano-senpai! I will definitely fulfill my role!" Airi gave an immediate response.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that her admired Senpai trusted her was enough to get her excitement boiling. The meeting ended fairly quickly after that, and Rinko pointed at Airi's hands, or more accurately at the memo book she was holding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san, is that a new memo book? It's so cute!" "Eh? …D-Do you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, the cherry blossom pattern is adorable! Where did you buy it?" "W-What does it matter?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh? You could just tell me… Then let met at least get a good look at it~" "No! No can do!" Airi embraced the memo book, hiding it from Rinko's hands,</p>
<p class="null-p">who gave a defeated 'So stingy~'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, that Mitani…" Airi grumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Some people just love talking about everything, and sometimes that can be more of a problem than a blessing.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no way I can tell him that I got it from Kiryuu-senpai…</p>
<p class="null-p">If Rinko found out the man-hating Airi would actually use a present she had received from a boy, rumours would start to spread immediately. She knew she couldn't disclose this information.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of Senpai, he still hasn't given Yuika a response. He should just say yes and go out with her…</p>
<p class="null-p">All it would take would be a short 'Yes' from Kiryuu Keiki, and then Yuika's happiness would be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I know." Airi came up with a good idea and smiled to herself. "For this, I think I'll ask the calligraphy club for help."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Exactly one day passed since Keiki had asked Shouma for advice. Inside the clubroom of the calligraphy club, Keiki, Sayuki, and Yuika all sat around the table, drinking tea, when a rare specimen showed up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nagase-san. It's been a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good day, Tokihara-senpai." The twin-tails Kouhai-Nagase Airi-gave a short bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">After everything that had happened, Airi and Sayuki had gotten much closer. "So what brings you here today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, about this…" Airi took out a booklet.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the official pamphlet for their Momozawa High School that they were attending.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, how nostalgic. I took a look at that before I was studying." "Yuika as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're making a new pamphlet for the students who are graduating this year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the student council even does work for that?" Keiki said in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I became responsible for it, so I was hoping everyone from the calligraphy club could help me out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Help you out in what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because of the declining birth rate, the number of graduating students at our school has gone down in number."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that sounds pretty tough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had even heard of some schools that had to close down because they didn't have enough students.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As the student council, we would love to attract more students, so we decided to put a lot of work into the pamphlet this year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And we decided to use a cute girl to model our uniform." "Hmh, hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As the person responsible for it, I would love it if I could get Yuika as the model."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Yuika-chan?!" Keiki asked in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi nodded. "If we could get Yuika, a world-renowned beauty, to act as our model, we'd definitely get more people to apply here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I bet you'd get more boys for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leaving aside all that, Koga-san is a total beauty after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Sayuki both consented. Then again, would Nagase-san be okay if more boys started attending the school? And there was also the problem of Yuika's opinion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No thank you. Yuika would rather not become some kind of attraction." "No way?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I figured as much."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, Yuika made a truly disgusted expression. "Why not have Airi be the model instead?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'm not as cute as Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? You're plenty cute yourself, Nagase-san." Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wha?" Airi froze when she heard the boy's praise. "Y-You won't get anything even if you praise me, okay?!" She grew beet red and gave a template tsundere response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai calls everyone cute, doesn't he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think Keiki-kun would make a great host in a host club." "I don't do it on purpose…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's and Sayuki fixed Keiki with cold gazes, and he suffered through it. Airi cleared her throat and spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika, why is it no good?" "Because Yuika said so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? I guess? What a shame~ But wait… who helped you score that Christmas date again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…" Yuika was clearly shaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, the person who had caused the date between Yuika and Keiki to happen had been Airi. In other words, Yuika still had a debt to repay-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Okay, Yuika understands." "Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But she has a condition." "What kind of condition?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A boy will have to be in that picture, right?" "Indeed, we have to show the male uniform as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then Yuika will think about it if you make Keiki-senpai the model." "Huh? Me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just perfect. I was thinking of asking Kiryuu-senpai in the first place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki never expected to be scouted as a model.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai's facial appearance doesn't really stand out, in a good way of course, so Yuika's cuteness will be emphasized even further."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san, even someone like me will feel hurt if you say that." It did hurt to be told that he basically looked average.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're going to introduce the school, wouldn't a black-haired model be much more impactful? I mean, blonde hair makes her look like a delinquent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse you?!" Yuika shouted in anger when Sayuki said that. "That's too much of a cliché! Yuika's hair is natural!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I want to apply as a model to take a picture together with Keiki- kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way! The person who will take a picture with Keiki-senpai will be Yuika!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two model candidates glared at each other. Airi observed this scene and flashed a teasing smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're as popular as ever, Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to a certain someone." Keiki couldn't even be bothered to deny it anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, they wouldn't reach a conclusion at this rate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright, it can't be helped then." Airi let out a sigh and stepped between the two fighting girls. "Now, now. Calm down, you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Witch-senpai…!" "Koga-san just…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. I understand where you two are coming from. Why don't we just take pictures of the two of you and then choose the better one? How about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A wonderful idea…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, no voices of complaint were raised.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">On the day of the photoshoot, five people had gathered in front of the student entrance after classes came to an end. The people present were the three models Keiki, Yuika, and Sayuki. Airi was also there to oversee the process as a member of the student council. Finally, a certain hoodie-wearing girl arrived, taking the role of the photographer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Ootori Koharu, and I'll be the photographer for today. Let's make this a success." Koharu introduced herself, giving a slight bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki watched this and felt healed by his upperclassman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai is the photographer, huh? There isn't anyone else who'd be better suited for the role."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She helped us a lot during the election, after all. I thought that the picture had been professionally taken."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki, Airi also gave a very positive evaluation herself. Koharu-senpai had become something of a personal photographer for the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not losing today, Koga-san." "That's Yuika's line, Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two girls were exchanging a few words of banter. "Alright, let's get this started!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Koharu's instructions, the photoshoot started. More than half of the students had already left school, making this the perfect chance. Yuika and Keiki started out as the models, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. It feels a bit… normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi checked over a few of the test pictures, but didn't seem quite satisfied. "It's for the school's pamphlet, so shouldn't that be just fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu's picture showed Keiki and Yuika standing next to each other in front of the entrance. It should be totally enough to show off the uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, we're planning on trying to get more people to apply to our school with this pamphlet. We have to have an impactful picture that will make more people want to come here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's Kouhai was oddly passionate about this. She was fired up enough for you to burn your hand if you touched her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what kind of picture are you imagining?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san, do you have something specific in mind?" "Let me think…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Koharu asked this, and Airi put one finger on her chin, thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know! Kiryuu-senpai, please embrace Yuika from behind. I want you to look like lovers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on! Airi?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Keiki and Yuika shouted in disbelief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't accept any complaints. This is for the school's sake. We want to give other people the idea that you can enjoy both your youth and your studies here at the same time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urgh, that's really solid reasoning…" "What should we do, Keiki-senpai?" "I mean, I don't mind…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Keiki-senpai is fine with it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two grew conscious of each other and started fidgeting nervously. "Wait a moment! I won't accept something as indecent as this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The only person to complain was Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once Yuika is done, you can do it as well, Tokihara-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I will wait in expectation."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki immediately grew quiet. Nagase-san had gotten exceptionally good at handling Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So then, let's restart the photoshoot. Kiryuu-kun, take care of Koga-san properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood." Keiki stood next to Yuika. "Yuika-chan, here I go…" "Y-Yes please…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had come this far, Keiki had to go through with it. He walked around</p>
<p class="null-p">his Kouhai's back, wrapping his arms around her small body. "Hawa?! Hawawawa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment his arms touched her, Yuika let out a shriek. Her face must be as red as a tomato by now. And Keiki's was the same-</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika-chan is so small. She fits right into my arms, she's soft all over, and she smells really nice…</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Yet again, Keiki grew fully conscious of Yuika's femininity. She seemed completely different from a normal girl, which made his heart race yet again. And if that weren't embarrassing enough already-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waah! This looks great!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is super cute when she's beet red~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh, I feel like my owner is being stolen by another dog…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The people around them made their own comments about the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what am I doing…?</p>
<p class="null-p">No one had an answer to that, most likely. "Yuika~ Could we get a more natural expression?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How could Yuika make a normal expression now?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes passed like this, with occasional teasing from Airi's part. "Alright, I think we're done!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu lowered her camera with a smile, finally freeing Keiki and Yuika. "Y-Yuika thought she would die from the embarrassment…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While the two of them caught their breath, Airi checked the pictures on the camera, seeming satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good job, Kiryuu-senpai! Thanks to you, I got to see possibly the cutest picture of Yuika I've seen yet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like her goal had changed midway through, but Keiki lacked the energy to point that out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But can you really use this picture? They're way too close. People might think that this is an indecent school…" Oddly enough, Sayuki was the first person to bring up decency.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, I doubt the teacher would give us permission to publish this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then this picture will have to be rejected." "Why did we work so hard, then…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu and Airi gave their merciless conclusion. It just shows that effort and investment don't always pay out. Keiki grit his teeth at the unfairness of the</p>
<p class="null-p">world, and Yuika walked over to Koharu, speaking in a quiet voice. "Um, Ootori-senpai? Could Yuika have a copy of that picture later?" "Fufu, of course. I'll send you a copy later, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much!" Yuika gave a beaming smile. "Yuika-chan looks like she's happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course she is." "Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had originally just been talking to himself, but his Kouhai next to him had apparently overheard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you not even understand why? You sure are dense, Kiryuu-senpai." "Oho? So you're saying that you understand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. She's happy to have a picture taken with the person she likes." "Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a picture with the person she likes. That's why she wants it. When you put it like that, it sounds so simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that I think about it, she was always looking at the picture of us on the date with such joy…</p>
<p class="null-p">She treasured it because it was so important to her. On the way home that day, as they sat in the bus, she continued to gaze at their picture where Keiki was carrying her like a princess. The instant Keiki understood that he himself had made her this happy, his cheeks started to burn up like a volcano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That Yuika-chan… How far is she willing to go to seduce me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's heart couldn't catch a break. She had, on purpose or by accident, been pressuring him more and more after the confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe. If you understand how charming Yuika is, then get together already and live happily ever after."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Happily ever after…" Keiki didn't expect to hear that. "Nagase-san, did you set up this photoshoot for Yuika-chan's sake?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought it was weird from the very beginning. Since Airi was Yuika's friend, she should know just how much she hated being a model for anything. But she used this photoshoot as a chance to get Keiki and Yuika closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Who knows?" Airi smiled and chose to remain silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki had his ideas, but he had no way of confirming them. "It's my turn now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a brief break, Sayuki switched places with Yuika, and the photoshoot continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-san, could you move closer to Kiryuu-kun?" "L-Like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perfect! It looks very cute!" Koharu gave a few quick commands as she pressed the camera shutter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu-senpai should just go work as a professional cameraman, Keiki thought to himself as the photoshoot continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you're taking pictures for the new school pamphlet?" "Okita-sensei?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their teacher Okita, the club advisor of the calligraphy club, appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, don't mind me, I was just walking around school," She said. "Don't mind me, just continue-Hm? Tokihara is participating?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right… Is there some sort of problem with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not really a problem, but wouldn't it better to take a picture with a student who isn't going to graduate this year?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to that nonchalant comment, Sayuki's retirement as a model had been decided, and they used Yuika for the pamphlet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, I'm so tired…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The photoshoot came to an end, and Keiki flopped onto his sofa at home without even changing out of his uniform. Mizuha had returned home earlier, and she brought him some cold tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work today. I never expected Nii-san to be chosen as a model." "I was just there for support, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Then as a reward for your hard work, I'll make Nii-san's favorite meat and potato stew, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that sounds great!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha returned back to the kitchen wearing her apron, humming to herself as she started preparing dinner. Keiki heard rhythmical cutting with the kitchen knife, and then he remembered something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were with Rintarou at school a while ago, right? What were you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mitani-kun? He invited me out for some tea." "That bastard has no restraint!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was something only a normie would be able to pull off. "I had to go shopping for dinner, though, so I had to decline." "I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, I feel like Mitani-kun has been talking to me pretty often as of late…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Ohhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou seemed to be the assertive type.</p>
<p class="null-p">He looks like a beautiful girl on the outside, but he can be so manly when he wants to…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki often forgot about it because Rintarou wore female clothes, but Rintarou always talked about breasts, so he was definitely a normal boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no doubt that Rintarou is out for Mizuha's breasts. She's got more than it looks like, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was actually the second biggest in terms of size in the calligraphy club, even beating Mao in the process. Of course, Keiki knew that Rintarou wasn't a bad person by any means. But using this as the main reason to approach his little sister was no joke for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He might not look like it, but he comes from the planet of boobs. Be careful, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…?" Mizuha's hand came to a stop, and she raised her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">She made an expression like she had seen something unexpected, and then she flashed her usual gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Okay. I'll be careful." She seemed happy as she accepted her older brother's advice.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be a bit sudden, but I'd like to hold a winter training camp!"</p>
<p class="null-p">During the latter half of January, on a normal weekday after classes had come to an end, Sayuki came to the clubroom and immediately blurted out a strange request. Out of the four people sitting at the table, Keiki gave the first response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did that come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good question. It's mostly because I'm tired of studying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If anything, you're not studying at all. Are you, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed. Thanks to my academic skills, I should be able to make it into the university I'm aiming for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you say, but isn't our local university here pretty top-class?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the genius girl of the calligraphy club for you. She should be able to get into her university of choice with ease.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But everyone around me is studying! I just feel mentally tired. Is this the exam doldrums?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds a bit different from the exam doldrums Yuika is used to…" "Don't worry, the club prez is just weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika and Mao muttered to themselves. But Sayuki continued talking without being bothered in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being the case, I don't have to worry about my studies in the slightest right now, so now that I've finished the National Center Test, I want to relax! Let's go on a 2 days, 1 night trip this weekend!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And where were you thinking of going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hee, hee. There's only one place you can go, right?" "A hot spring city?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. That sounds pretty good, but that's not it. It's the snowy mountains!" "The snowy mountains…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A ski slope definitely sounded in-season. However, the reaction that the girls had to the idea was relatively cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm bad with cold places…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here. I like curling up under a kotatsu much better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika just wants to lock herself up in her room instead." Mizuha, Mao, and Yuika all voiced their opinions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a pretty mediocre response from the crowd."</p>
<p class="null-p">There are a lot of girls who don't like the cold, so Keiki had expected as much. "A-Anyway, we're going there! It's already been decided!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls stared blankly at Sayuki, utterly confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if you all don't want to come, it'll just be Keiki and I alone together for 2 days and 1 night~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, all three girls visibly twitched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be even more fun, I guess. Nobody will bother us that way, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have any say in the matter, huh?" Keiki felt oddly nostalgic when he realized his opinion wouldn't be taken into account.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-That won't do, Witch-senpai! Yuika won't allow a trip to happen with just the two of you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, leaving a high school boy and girl alone like that would be unhealthy." "I suddenly feel like going skiing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Provoked by Sayuki, the girls made an immediate 180-degree turn in attitude. "That's a pretty nasty way of getting what you want," Keiki sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, the snowy mountain trip with everyone from the calligraphy club was quickly planned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I'll have to arrive at a conclusion now." The only boy in the club secretly steeled his resolve.</p>
Chapter 5: A certain calligraphy club's snowy mountain trip</p>
<p class="null-p">Weekend had arrived, and it was around noon. The members of the calligraphy club were greeted by a silver world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the mountaaaaaaains!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So cold! White! And full of snow!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The weather had blessed this ski resort, Keki and Yuika were brimming with energy at the sight of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you keep screaming like that, you'll cause an avalanche." "Sheesh, you two are acting like kids."</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Sayuki and Mao were acting like their parents. The final one to comment was Mizuha, who just shivered from the cold and groaned. They had taken the bus early in the morning, and after arriving at the lodge, they immediately headed to the ski resort.</p>
<p class="null-p">They all were in perfect ski attire, with Keiki wearing grey, Sayuki blue, Yuika pink, Mao orange, and Mizuha green. Naturally, they were all wearing headgear and gloves to protect themselves against the cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'll have to thank Ootori-san for letting us borrow her residence here." "Right. I'll let her know the next time I see her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like before, they were residing in yet another house belonging to the Ootori Family. Apparently, they had quite a few residences like this, which was quite an impressive thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? What's wrong, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's little sister pulled on his sleeve and pointed to the ski center building they had just come from.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I just read books inside?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're dead-set on not going outside, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki himself fought hard to withstand the stabbing cold hitting his skin. For someone like Mizuha, who was more vulnerable to the cold, this must be even greater suffering. But the person who answered Mizuha was Sayuki instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not allowing anyone to stay inside. Everyone will be participating." "Ehhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we're here already, I want to have some fun with you, Mizuha." "If you say so, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to their skilled persuasion, Mizuha agreed to participate. You rarely would see snowy mountains like these where they were from, so it'd be a waste to spend that time inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, it's pretty hard to move in this ski outfit. On top of that, it feels like the girl power is way too low compared to a swimsuit or something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Girl power? Well, that's just how it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why don't we wear swimsuits all winter to entrance Keiki-kun all year?" "You'll die, so stop that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't want to see a frozen dead body wearing a swimsuit. The goal of these clothes was to protect against the cold, so it couldn't be helped if they didn't look quite as fashionable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Forget the swimsuits, how about we go ahead? We're just wasting time here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! Yuika wants to have a snowball fight!" "But we're at a ski resort."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has never skied before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I guess it hardly ever snows in our town."</p>
<p class="null-p">The most they had gotten all year was the small amount on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">And it all melted soon after.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a bit before, but it's been a hot minute." "You can ski, Mao-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mama would sometimes take me to a ski resort when I was little." "Nanjou can basically do anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can borrow skis and sleds. Since I can't ski at all, I think I'll gallantly ride a sled."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is that gallant?" Yuika gave the proud Sayuki a cold gaze, and then Mao called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why not try some skiing after the snowball fight? I can teach you." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. I'd be lonely skiing all on my own."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much! Yuika is actually a bit interested."</p>
<p class="null-p">The unathletic Sayuki chose the sled, whereas Yuika challenged the ski slopes with the assistance of Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll try some skiing myself. How about you, Mizuha?" "I'll just make a snow man over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That actually sounds pretty fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was the type of person who could work on something alone, which made this a perfect fit for her. After everyone made their choices, they started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, this is pretty fun." Keiki was a beginner at skiing, but just sliding down a hill wasn't as hard as he had imagined, and he managed to be fairly successful.</p>
<p class="null-p">The wind blowing past him gave him a rush. He felt like he could get used to this. After enjoying his time alone a bit, he found himself back at the bottom. Mao and Yuika walked towards him with skis and ski poles in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you're doing pretty good, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you just have to get used to the basics." "Yuika is still a bit scared…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I guess you can't ski that well yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you ignoring Nanjou's advice?" Keiki asked, and Yuika made an awkward face in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-senpai is showing Yuika the basics, but it's still too hard for Yuika…" "Ugh…Sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Nanjou is mostly skiing by intuition alone, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the type of person to do things with natural talent, so teaching this might not be the easiest thing for her to do. Keiki felt a bit bad for Mao, but at this rate, neither of them would be able to enjoy skiing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why don't I teach her, and you go ski some, Nanjou?" "Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I feel like taking a break anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then please do." Mao gave a slightly defeated apology and went up towards the higher-skilled course.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing her off, Keiki turned towards his student. "Then should we start the lesson?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do, Keiki-sensei!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika formed fists and gripped her ski poles in determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For starters, forget everything Nanjou taught you. It probably won't be of much use."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Yuika figured as much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You won't be able to turn into a natural in just a day, so let's focus on the beginner course for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, we'll start with the ハ posture…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started with a basic lecture, teaching her what he had learned from watching others and trying himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you can't stand fully upright right after you start skiing, you have to drop your center of gravity some more. Lower your waist a bit." He explained, using the mental picture he had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… a bit more like this…" Keiki moved next to the girl, putting his hand on her hip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like this. You have to angle your knees a bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… O-Okay…" Yuika started fidgeting, but she obeyed Keiki's advice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's great. Then next is how you hold the ski poles." Keiki confirmed the improvement in her posture and went on to check how she was holding her poles.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, he walked around behind her back, grabbing both her hands and moving them back and forth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you're skiing, you hold the tips of the sticks behind you-" "A-Aren't you a bit too close…? Y-Yuika can feel your breath!" "…Huh? Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing that something was off with his student, Keiki put the lesson on hold. When he walked around the girl to face her, he was greeted by her beet red face. It looked like a ripe apple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay? Your face is burning red." "Whose fault do you think this is?!" "Huh?! You mean it's mine?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're way too close! You're touching Yuika's hip, embracing her from behind like it's natural, and your breath was tickling Yuika's neck that entire time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Oh. Sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Keiki had been a bit too close after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just saw parents teaching their children like this before, so I used that as a reference."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, you were treating Yuika like a child, and that's why you got so close."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh…" Keiki didn't know how to respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika however didn't dwell too much on it. She just fixed her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, Senpai acting so clingy wasn't half bad either. Yuika was a bit surprised, but it felt like we're a lovey-dovey couple…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lovey-dovey couple?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was surprised, but she wasn't wrong. A one-on-one lesson between boy and girl could easily be interpreted like that. Keiki kept that in mind during the teaching afterwards, and after a few ups and downs, Yuika managed to ski for around one hour without falling over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki finished coaching his Kouhai, and after he took off his skis, he went back to the ski resort to take a break. He spotted Mizuha near the building, taking pictures of two snowmen. They were about the size of grade school children, with small branches as limbs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you made two snowmen, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was thinking of only making one, but then it might have felt lonely, so I made them a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see." Keiki said. "But since they're a couple, why not give them some children as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that sounds nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki just blurted out the first thing that came to mind, but Mizuha immediately agreed. She put away her smartphone and flashed a smile as she stood in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will you help me, Nii-san?" "Sure thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's make some children together, okay?" "Phrasing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That could sound like something entirely different depending on context. "I'm always ready to go, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're talking about snowmen, right?!" After that, they made lots of children.</p>
<p class="null-p">After making some (snowmen) children with Mizuha, Keiki took a quick bathroom break inside the skiing center, and when he came back out Sayuki called out to him, pulling a sled after her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-kun, were you taking a break?" "Yes. What about you, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been riding solo on my sled this entire time, so I wanted to go down from a bit higher up. Why don't you join me, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been planning on skiing some more, but riding on a sled didn't sound too bad. With that decided, the two sat on the lift and slowly moved up towards the summit. All the other guests around them were equipped with skis or snowboards, making Keiki and Sayuki the only ones with a sled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The view up here is something else." "Yes, we're pretty high up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are we going to be fine going down all this way with a sled?" "Sure thing. Let's hop on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yessir."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki took the lead, and Keiki got on the sled after her. "Hold on to me, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will do."</p>
<p class="null-p">Safety first, after all. They both tightly held onto the grips on their left and right. After checking that everything was ready to go, they started descending. They slowly picked up speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, this is pretty fun." "Right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">You couldn't make any precise moves steering-wise, but it had a different type of enjoyment than skiing. It made sense that this was popular with children.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I always admired the idea of riding a bike with two people." "A sled is a lot different from a bike, don't you think?" "Really? Maybe you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, aren't we going a bit too fast?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed we are. Maybe we started a bit too high up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also… if we don't take a right soon, won't we go off-course?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sled was hugging the left side of the course, sliding down at quite an impressive speed. If they kept going the way they were headed they'd end up in a thicket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, turn right! You have to turn right now!" "Turn? Can you even do that with a sled?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?" Keiki's brain was filled with fear after hearing that. "Senpai, stop!</p>
<p class="null-p">Stop!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know how to use the brakes!" "Are you kidding me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their only saving grace was that no cliff was in front of them. But the fact that they were sledding at high speed didn't make it any less dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouaaaaaaaaaaah?!" "S-Stoooooop!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their desperate attempts to stop proved to be futile, and they dove straight into the thicket ahead of them.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">In a deep forest covered with snow, Sayuki and Keiki finally came to a halt and got up from the sled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought I was going to die…" "Same here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If possible, Keiki would rather not experience that again. "Sayuki-senpai, are you hurt anywhere?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine. What about you, Keiki-kun?" "Same here."</p>
<p class="null-p">After moving his body to check for injuries, he found nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, he was just tired because of the near-death experience.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've gone down quite a bit." "That's right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They looked up at the place they fell down from. Although it wasn't a vertical wall, climbing up that slope…</p>
<p class="null-p">"That looks like it'd be be quite difficult." "Indeed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If they lost their footing in the process, things might go downhill. Literally and figuratively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's take a detour and go back to the ski resort." "That's all we can do, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">It would mean they had to walk through the forest, but it'd be much safer than trying the risky way up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about the sled?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's leave it here. This is an emergency situation, so I'll explain it to the staff later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the two started walking back towards the ski lodge. Although they had gone off-course by quite a bit, the area wasn't too large to begin with, so they should make it back soon. That being said, after they had walked for a few minutes, that naive thinking was blown away. Unlike the ski resort, which</p>
<p class="null-p">controlled the snow in the vicinity, here it was left all alone. The snow could even reach up to their knees depending on the location, making this quite tiresome work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, it's pretty deep over here, so be careful." "Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki was taller than the girl, he walked in front and made a path. It proved to be the right choice to leave behind the sled. They wouldn't be able to make it through here carrying something that big. But their surroundings started to change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, it's starting to snow…" "No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The clear sky was suddenly filled with thick clouds, and just when Keiki was thinking about the cold breeze that blew past them, particles of snow came falling down from the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the mountains for you. The weather changes as quickly as the temper of a cheating husband."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really couldn't have thought of any better example?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, this wasn't the time to joke around. Keiki glared up at the snow falling down, muttering to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This might actually be really bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, a few minutes later, his bad premonition turned out to be true. While they were on the move, the weather turned bad really quickly, and the gentle snowfall started to turn into a storm. The wind grew stronger, and the temperature dropped significantly. However, the biggest problem wasn't even the wind or temperature, but the endlessly-falling snow. Because of this, their field of view grew much smaller, and they soon lost track of the direction back to the ski resort.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy and girl stood still. "Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…" "Isn't this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed it is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The 'Stranded in the Snowy Mountains' event?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's talk about this. A 'stranded in the snowy mountains event' is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It's a life-threatening situation. You often see such developments in manga or dramas, but most people seldom run into one in reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?! W-What should we do?! What do we do about this?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's calm down for a moment! We have to contact someone in times like these!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's right, we have the weapon of civilization-namely a smartphone- with us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, it's always a bad idea to panic. If you start acting rashly based on anxiety, you'll lose sight of what's around you. The perfect counter to emergencies is to stay calm. For starters, they just had to contact their friends and request help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah." Sayuki grew pale. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought it'd be bad if I lost it, so I left my smartphone in my room…" "Ah, me too!" Keiki screamed in despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew his luck so he had left his phone in his room for safety reasons. "…It's my fault. I said we should ride the sled down from the summit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm at fault just as much, since I didn't think of the danger and just joined you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, let's focus on getting home safely for now." "…That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Casting blame in a situation like this wouldn't do any good. Keiki felt relieved that Sayuki didn't stay in a disheartened mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">But thanks to this blizzard, I can't even see right in front of me…</p>
<p class="null-p">These were really snowy mountains, so if they walked over a cliff without realizing it, that'd be an immediate game over. Now that they had lost their way, wandering around carelessly might make their situation even worse. If only they could at least find a spot to wait out the storm…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun!" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a building over there!" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki looked over to where Sayuki was pointing, he spotted a black shadow. He couldn't make out the exact shape because of the blizzard, but judging from the size and general form, it should be a house or building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perfect timing! Let's go, Sayuki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a ray of hope in this disastrous situation. They rushed over to the building, only to find out that it was a small mountain hut. Compared to its small size, it had relatively big windows. It was a perfect place to seek refuge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me! Is someone in there?!" Keiki knocked on the door, but no response came.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, it was deserted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't seem like anybody is here, so let's use this to shelter ourselves from the blizzard." Keiki said. He brushed the snow away from in front of the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me help you."</p>
<p class="null-p">They cleared away the snow until the door opened, and Sayuki turned the doorknob. They hurriedly went inside and closed the door behind them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, we're saved…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Luckily the door wasn't locked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if we'll get scolded for just entering."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was an emergency situation. I'm sure they'll forgive us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, we'll just have to stay on stand by until the snow stops. It'd be great if they had something warm in here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably not. It's just a small mountain hut, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A small hut like this wasn't made to live in, so it was more like they were now inside a freezer. The floor was solid concrete, and there was a big shelf standing in a corner. The room was roughly twelve square meters, and unfamiliar tools most likely used to deal with excessive snow were scattered about. Since this</p>
<p class="null-p">wasn't a place made to live in, there wasn't anything to be found to warm oneself. It was a great place for protection against the blizzard, but staying here for too long wasn't an option either. On top of that-</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good. My clothes are wet from the snow…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki looked down at herself, and Keiki nodded. Since they had been walking through the blizzard, water had built up inside their clothes. The same went for their headgear and gloves, quickly robbing the two of them of the last bit of warmth they had. At this rate, the situation would only get worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this rate, we'll freeze to death."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if there's no heater in here, we might find some towels or other clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's look around." Keiki tried to stay positive.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, nothing of great value was found. There was no stove and no matches. It was of little surprise that they couldn't find any clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's nothing to warm us up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I found some blankets, Sayuki-senpai!" "Eh, really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. But…" Keiki continued as he showed her the blanket. "There was only one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the sight of that, Sayuki lost her ability to speak. They needed two blankets for two people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun…" "Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know of one method to survive this situation…" "What a coincidence. So do I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If they continued to wear their drenched clothes, they would eventually freeze to death. With the blanket Keiki found, they could warm their undressed bodies, but with only one available…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically… we have to warm each other's bodies…" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki spoke with an embarrassed tone, which only added to Keiki's own</p>
<p class="null-p">embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This is embarrassing, so I'd prefer it if you didn't look at me." "Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My underwear today isn't cute at all." "That's what you're embarrassed about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes passed after they found the item, and Keiki and Sayuki were sitting next to each other under the blanket. Of course, below this blanket they were only wearing their underwear, so they were basically naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's much warmer now." "That it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this is really embarrassing…" "That it is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our only saving grace is that our underwear was dry enough to keep on." "If not for that, I'm pretty sure that my reason would break down."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could thank his lucky stars for that. Then again, this situation was already dangerous enough for his reason.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"But we've shared a time like this together before, so this is nothing special."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When we went to the pool together during the summer break. My bikini top was washed away in the wave pool and you covered my chest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I remember now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't allow the girl to be publicly embarrassed like that, so he resorted to a last-ditch effort of embracing her face-to-face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking back on it, I did something outrageous there, didn't I…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I was really happy." The girl showed a kind smile. "Keiki-kun will always protect me. Even today when I was riddled with anxiety… Even though you're younger than me, you're very reliable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see." He felt embarrassed to be told that so directly. He didn't know how to handle this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. I really love you, Keiki-kun." "Huh? S-Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl gently leaned against Keiki, putting her head on his shoulder. Yet again, Keiki felt like his reason was about to break apart like a glass falling to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I imagined it every single day. A future I spend with you, Keiki-kun. Not just right now, but the two of us being together forever. I realized just how fun it would be."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I'm a masochist, I like it when someone treats me roughly, but… If it's Keiki-kun, then I probably would be just as happy with normal love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki heard this, he didn't know what to say. He had never thought that the girl would ever tell him this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt happy, but yet something stung right in his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's the same as with Yuika-chan…</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he felt happy hearing this, he also couldn't fully accept the</p>
<p class="null-p">feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki-senpai said that she would become a normal girl for me. That should make me happy, and yet I feel so gloomy…</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt gloomy, and his chest tightened up. Every time he received affection from them, every time he felt attracted to them, this unfamiliar feeling would appear. Keiki had assumed that this might be the reason he couldn't find an answer to their individual confessions, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">Do I actually not want the two of them to become normal girls?</p>
<p class="null-p">That hypothesis could explain this reaction. Even though Keiki thought it was idiotic, that idea wouldn't go away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Keiki-senpai! Witch-senpai! Are you okay?!" "…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The door to the cabin swung open and Yuika jumped inside, bringing Keiki's thoughts to a screeching halt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, there they are! Mao-senpai! Mizuha-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The blonde-haired girl turned towards the door again, and both Mao and Mizuha stepped inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you're right. Both of them." "Thank goodness…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They spotted the two lost people and sighed in relief. Of course, this is where you would normally que an emotional reunion, but Yuika made a cold gaze as she looked at the inside of the cabin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You two. Why do you look like that?" "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, Keiki and Sayuki were still almost naked. Even if they were covered in the blanket, you could still see what was beneath. The clothes they had taken off were right next to them as swell, so trying to deny it wouldn't work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We came here rushing out of worry… and then we find you like this?! How shameless can you be!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it, Yuika-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was an emergency situation. Our clothes were drenched because of the blizzard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then again, I can't say I disliked the situation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are a pervert through and through, Witch-senpai!" Yuika vehemently complained at the sight of her two upperclassmen. Keiki ignored her, however, and asked his Kouhai a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I'm surprised you found this place in the middle of that blizzard." "What are you talking about? It already stopped snowing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? No way!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki glanced outside and saw the sun shining like that blizzard just now had been a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How fickle can the weather up here be?" Keiki muttered in disbelief, when Sayuki spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, how did you know we were here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a stupid question. Once it stopped snowing and we returned to the cottage, we could see two tracks outside, so we didn't even have to search for long."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, the cottage?" "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is right behind Ootori-senpai's private residence." "What did you say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that exclamation, Yuika and the others waited for them to change, and once they went outside, Keiki and Sayuki saw that this small cabin was a mere ten meters away from the Ootori residence.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Around thirty minutes after they had been saved, Keiki was warming himself up in front of the stove inside the living room, and Sayuki came back, having just finished her bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew. A hot bath after being lost in the woods is the best." "How ironic, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about MIzuha-san and the others?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're out getting the ingredients for dinner. There's apparently a</p>
<p class="null-p">supermarket a few minutes away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh really? Ah, the bath is open, so feel free to use it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for letting me go first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Ladies first,' as they say."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki went up the stairs to his bedroom, put on a change of clothes, and headed to the bath. While engulfed in the calm scent of warm water, he took off his clothes. When he passed by the mirror in the changing room, he remembered what happened in the cabin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai sure was beautiful…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The softness of her skin, her sweet scent… It all came rushing back to Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Not good." He forced his head clear of these impure thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he dwelled on it any longer, things would get awkward once he saw Sayuki again. For now, taking a bath comes first, he thought, and he took off the rest of his clothes and headed into the bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, this is pretty big."</p>
<p class="null-p">The cottage's bath was a sight to behold. It was more than two times the size of an average family bath. It had a much larger bathtub, which would be able to fit maybe four girls at the same time. After Keiki washed his hair and body with the provided shampoo, he headed towards the warm water. A milky-flavored scent filled the area, which helped Keiki relax even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh, I'm coming back to life…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been tired to the bone after getting lost before. The bath water healed his exhaustion to a level where he felt he could fall asleep any second.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right. I wonder what's for dinner today." "We're making paella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, really? That sounds great…"</p>
<p class="null-p">………Hm?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me for a second~" "…Wueh? Huh? Mizuha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The door had opened without Keiki even realizing it, and Mizuha entered. And, of course, she was naked. She was covering her body with a bath towel, but that didn't exactly cover much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on a darn second?!" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am! Taking a bath! Right now!" "Yup. I knew that before I came in." "You just admitted to your crimes?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What a ridiculous turn of events. Ignoring the fact that this wasn't even their own home-No, even then it would be weird-she was invading the bath of her older brother during such a situation. That was too bold even for Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that Nii-san was taking a bath when we came back from the shopping trip, so I thought I might join you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should you really be saying that? If I scream, the others will come running." "What kind of threat is that supposed to be?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What made her think of saying something like that? "So wait just a second until I wash my body." "…Can I leave first?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Did you say something just now?" "I was wondering if I could leave first." "Hm? Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you some kind of deaf NPC?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the sounds of it, Keiki was not allowed to leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">What in the world is going on?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki made sure that he wouldn't see anything by turning his back towards his little sister. That removed the risk, yes, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the shower behind me still makes it exciting…</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the water hitting the ground tickled Keiki's ears. Because he had averted his field of view, his ears must have grown more sensitive. Inside his head, Keiki chanted Mizuha is my little sister. Mizuha is my little sister. Eventually the sounds of water stopped and Mizuha walked towards Keiki with the bath towel</p>
<p class="null-p">wrapped around her. With no reservation whatsoever, she sat down facing her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, this feels great, right?" "R-Right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why aren't you looking at me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I thought it'd be bad if I looked too much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can if you want to. I'm already shoulders-deep in the water, and the bath salt makes it hard to see, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" Keiki gave in to Mizuha's logic and faced her directly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as she had said, Keiki really couldn't see much below her shoulders. "Fufu. You finally looked at me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The smile Mizuha gave Keiki inflicted him with a feeling of discomfort. It didn't look like her usual relieved one. It was more like she was forcing herself to smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? You're acting weird, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Weird? …Yeah, I guess I really am acting weird right now." When she stopped her fake smile, she looked like a lost child. "Hey, Nii-san. I was really scared today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Scared of what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The weather at the ski resort turned bad really quickly, and Mao-chan left with Yuika-chan inside, but Nii-san didn't come home… And then we talked about how you might have gotten lost somewhere… and Mao-chan said we should just check the cottage…" She hugged her shoulders tightly as she spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"While we were heading back here, I was really scared… Scared that Nii-san… that even Nii-san would vanish from my side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was crying. Keiki's little sister who rarely, if ever, cried, was now holding her shaking shoulders as big round tears fell from her cheeks and vanished into the warm water. When Keiki saw that face, he understood the crime he had committed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm a moron.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mizuha had still been young, she lost her real parents in an accident. She knew the pain of never seeing someone precious to you ever again. And yet</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had made her truly fear that yet again. "…! Mizuha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he realized it, he was already embracing the girl. "I'm sorry for making you worry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a brief moment, it didn't matter that they were naked in a bath. Keiki just felt like the girl would break if he didn't do anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm safe, okay? I definitely won't leave you alone, so… stop crying, please." "…Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Okay." Mizuha's body relaxed in Keiki's arms. "I'm really glad that you all were okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have been worried even after Keiki and Sayuki were found. She had probably come to check up on him in the bath to try to cope with this anxiety. Keiki decided to stay like this until her anxiety went away. Time passed as he embraced his cute little sister. Then it happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…" "Keiki-senpai…" "Kiryuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?! Everyone?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The door to the bath had happened without a sound. Sayuki, Yuika, and Mao were all standing behind it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Taking a bath with your little sister is one thing, but hugging her while you're both totally naked…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe Keiki-senpai is actually the biggest pervert in the calligraphy club?" "You're crossing the line that siscons aren't supposed to cross here, Kiryuu." "Hold on! You've got the wrong idea about this!" Keiki was attacked by a fear</p>
<p class="null-p">of death and ostracization from society.</p>
<p class="null-p">He moved away from Mizuha as he tried to think of an excuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki spoke up. "We don't need any excuses. Mizuha-san must have tried to seduce you again, right? She said she went to the bathroom, but I never thought</p>
<p class="null-p">she'd take such a drastic detour."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I decided to try to seduce Nii-san for a bit." "Mizuha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but Nii-san was the one who hugged me." "Hold on?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they heard these words, the gazes of Yuika and the others turned colder than any blizzard. What made things even worse was that Keiki couldn't argue back, since it was the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey Keiki-kun?" "Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just because you two are a siscon and brocon doesn't mean you can take baths together forever, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed." Keiki couldn't think of anything else to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it took a lot of time to clear up this misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">They finished eating their dinner made by master chef Mizuha, played some card games in the living room, talked about this and that, and eventually all headed to their individual rooms. Since they had three rooms to sleep in, they split up into pairs like they did back during summer camp. Keiki slept alone, Sayuki and Yuika were in one room, and Mizuha and Mao were in the other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki turned off the light in his room and lay face-up on his bed, thinking about what had happened that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, I couldn't think of how to respond…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The incidents with Sayuki and Mizuha were too hectic, and Keiki had no time to come up with his response to the confessions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's smartphone vibrated. He turned over on his bed and found a single unread message.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sender turned out to be Nanjou Mao. The message read: 'Can you come to the porch right now?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does she want at this hour?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't mention the reason, but Keiki couldn't sleep either way, so it didn't matter. Keiki put on a hoodie and headed out to the porch. When he walked down the hallway and opened the door, he was greeted by the girl, her hair down, wearing a cardigan. She turned around to face him, giving a quiet 'Yo' as a greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad you're still awake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I couldn't really sleep. How's Mizuha doing?" "She fell asleep right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It must have been a real shock for her to hear that you got lost." "It seems like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry Mizuha too much, will you?" "I know. I'm reflecting on it."</p>
<p class="null-p">They had been lucky this time. Next time, things might not end so happily. If Mizuha were the one who had ended up lost, Keiki would have probably gone crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it wasn't anybody's fault, so there's no use getting hung up on it." "Yeah, thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. We're good friends after all, Kiryuu." Mao said nonchalantly. When Keiki heard her say that, he felt relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, did you have any reason why you called me here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right…" Mao suddenly started fidgeting. "I want you to take a look at this, Kiryuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something you want to show me?" "This…" Mao handeed Keiki her smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reflected on the phone screen under the starry night was a familiar magazine cover.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It came out today. The magazine that has my oneshot." "Oh? Seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's only the digital version. I couldn't bring the physical copy with me." "It's fine. I'll buy it myself once we get back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this has the manga you were working on before?" "Yup. The one I finished when you helped me."</p>
<p class="null-p">That must have been around the end of the sports festival. Mao's first manga for the magazine had been turned down, which put Mao in a slump. Keiki helped her gather data, and they had stayed over at a hotel. On that night, Mao finished the manuscript.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made several changes after that with the help of my editor, so it took some time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it was fun. Every time I fixed it, it got more and more interesting. Though I got seriously close to running out of time towards the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, you've been really busy as of late."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not only was the BL manga on her schedule, but she also had to focus on the oneshot for the magazine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's lots of reviews out already. I just checked them." "And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hee hee, what do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could guess, thanks to her confident smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All great. Even my editor praised me. They told me that a serialization might not be far away at this rate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously. And it's all thanks to Kiryuu." "Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I could power through it because you stayed with me. I thought I was done for back then, but I'm glad I kept going."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So thank you. I'm really glad we met each other."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see…" Keiki's heart skipped a beat when he saw the girl's oddly innocent smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew he didn't do much. He had just helped her out a bit, and most of this was thanks to her hard work. But he felt happy knowing that he could</p>
<p class="null-p">support the girl just a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If my manga ends up getting serialized, you'd better buy a hundred volumes of it, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't get ahead of yourself there… But I'll definitely buy it." Keiki said. He felt like she might be able to do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew that she had enough raw talent, and that she had the desire to improve herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but I'm not going to stop being a BL mangaka either. I still need you to flirt with Akiyama more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll have to pass on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">All that serious talk from just now had been ruined. But Keiki felt relieved to see that Mao was acting like her usual perverted self.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Huh? Why do I feel relieved?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why would Keiki feel relieved that the girl was remaining a pervert? This thought soon turned into a strong feeling of discomfort.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt so gloomy when Yuika-chan and Sayuki-senpai said they'd stop being perverts, but I feel relieved to hear that Nanjou will continue being a BL mangaka…</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a clear contradiction.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it was weird from the very beginning. I had been hoping for the perverts to become normal people, but I couldn't fully accept Yuika-chan acting normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt happy after hearing their feelings. The sweet sensation in his chest after hearing they were willing to become normal girls wasn't fake, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">So why couldn't I choose one of them?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why couldn't Keiki find an answer? Why did he hesitate for so long? If only he had a small hint…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nanjou?" "What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If the person you liked didn't accept that hobby of yours, would you give up on it just for the person you like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Where did that come from?" "Just tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Hmmm…" The girl thought about it for a second, and eventually made a serious expression. "When we went to the sea together before, we were</p>
<p class="null-p">looking at the stars, right?" "Yeah, during summer camp."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels like it's been such a long time. Then again, half a year has passed since then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, because of Sayuki-senpai's chocolate-" "We're not going to talk about that, Kiryuu." "…Right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided to not remember the tragedy that had occured.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, I asked you what you'd think if I stopped drawing BL books, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, now that you mention it…" Keiki faintly remembered that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a question like if Keiki could fall in love with her in that scenario.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't joke about that any longer. BL is my everything. It's my reason for living."</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the starry sky, the girl made a confident smile and continued. "That's why I won't stop doing it, even for the boy I like!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">These words felt like a falling star falling into Keiki's chest. There's no need to change yourself, nor to give up on the things you like.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_11_15.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Mao's words repeated inside Keiki's head. "Ah, I finally understand…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything connected inside his mind. The reason why he couldn't respond to Yuika and Sayuki's confessions, and the origin of that gloomy feeling inside his chest. It all clicked. The final piece he needed finally filled in the puzzle.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">On the morning of the new week, Keiki got up from his bed and sent a single email. He kept it short. 'Please come to the library room today after school'. It was time to give his Kouhai a response to her confession.</p>
Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, once classes came to an end, Keiki made his way to the library room. He entered the room that was filled with dusty books and a moldy smell. After he had waited for a brief moment, Yuika entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you wait long, Keiki-senpai?" "No, I just got here myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that." She showed a faint smile and grabbed the hem of her skirt. "So, today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I finally have an answer. I'm sorry that you had to wait until today." "You can say that again. Yuika thought you might have forgotten about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika pouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew that she was allowed to have that reaction after he had made her wait for around a month. But, thanks to that, he had finally managed to face his own feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can Yuika hear your response then?" "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stood up, facing Yuika. Her green eyes were gazing directly at Keiki, waiting for what he would say next.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry. I can't respond to your feelings, Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't go out with Yuika. That was the answer Keiki had arrived at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is… that so…?" Yuika muttered quietly, showing no emotions at first. "Yuika had prepared herself for the possibility that she might get rejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She wanted to properly give up after being rejected. She doesn't want to be a bother for Senpai and be regarded as a woman you wouldn't want to have around… She had planned on giving up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A tear ran down her cheek. She was crying so silently that Keiki wouldn't have realized it if he wasn't looking at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please tell Yuika. How should a normal girl react? Should she think of the other person, and give up with a smile? If so, then Yuika-won't be able to become a normal girl!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…? Woah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like Keiki had relived that time. Just like on the day he had found out about Yuika's sadistic nature, Keiki was pushed down on the ground, landing on his behind, and Yuika hopped on top of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?! What are you-?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up for a second!" "Bguh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">To rob Keiki of his ability to speak, she covered his face with something. It felt soft, warm, and gave off a certain amount of volume and elasticity. It felt oddly familiar to him…</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, is this Yuika-chan's butt?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, what was pressing down on Keiki's face was Yuika's butt, covered with pink fabric. She rubbed her butt around like she was marking him with her smell. With both his nose and mouth covered, Keiki found himself unable to breathe. All he could do was groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like Yuika was too naive. She should have done this from the start." She said with a cold tone. "Yuika will make you choose, Keiki-senpai. Will you take back your previous words and become Yuika's lover, or live on to become Yuika's pig for the rest of your life?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmgh…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Become her lover or her pig? Neither choice was favorable for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but you can't talk like this, right? Then let's do it like this. If you want to become Yuika's lover, tap your right hand on the floor, and if you want to become her pig, tap your left hand on the floor." The girl explained the rules like this was just a game.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with her butt still on his face, she forced the choice onto Keiki. "Now, Keiki-senpai. Which will you choose?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mgguh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki himself started to sweat profusely, but the sweet scent coming from her behind made his head spin. Though he felt physical pain, he also felt relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah, Yuika-chan feels way more normal when she's sadistic, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she often resorted to physical violence, she was cuter than any other sadist in the world. That was the true identity of Koga Yuika. But, even so, Keiki couldn't accept her love nonetheless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tap, tap, tap.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tapped both his hands on the floor. He hoped that would get across that he had no plans of doing either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why? Why is Yuika not good enough?! After she acted nice, after she acted like a normal girl, you still won't choose her?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mguh!" Keiki still could barely breathe, and just groaned again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though… Even though Yuika likes you this much, even though she only has Keiki-senpai…!" Yuika let her feelings flow out of her, and her movement finally stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please… take responsibility…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The responsibility for having made Yuika soft like this…!" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she said that, large tears fell down onto Keiki's chest. She must be talking about the first time they had met in the library. She told Keiki that she had loved him ever since. When he heard that, he felt happy, yet sad at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl had finally calmed down, and was sitting on the ground next to Keiki like like a puppy that had been scolded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Are you not going to choose Yuika, Keiki-senpai?" "Yeah, I can't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your answer won't change?" "Yeah, it won't change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Yuika not good enough?" "Yeah, it can't be you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Everytime Keiki responded, it felt like sharp needles stabbing his chest. And the person being told these words must be hurting even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really happy to hear you say that you were willing to become a normal girl for me. When you acted normally, you were really cute, and I might have been able to fall in love with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought he had been done dealing with perverts. They would never consider his opinion. They were always sexually harassing him and treating him like their plaything. That's why Keiki had felt really happy to hear Yuika say she would be willing to become a normal girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I don't want others to change themselves for me. I don't want them to kill themselves. Nobody will be happy if one party just has to hold back."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the origin of Keiki's sense of discomfort with Yuika's confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of what Mao had said, he finally realized it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It all makes sense now. That you being a sadist is just the same as me liking big breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That example is the worst, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who am I to change your interests? If someone told me to start liking small breasts now, I doubt I would be able to do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This really is the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah, that it is. All this time, Keiki had said that it had to be a normal girl or nothing, and yet in the very last moment, he had done a complete 180.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I realized it thanks to you, Yuika-chan. Everyone has their own interests, and that's what makes them special. That's what makes them irreplaceable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want you to force yourself to change. But I also can't become what you want me to."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't feel any excitement from being treated badly by a girl. He hated being stepped on, and he'd feel sad if he were insulted. That was why he couldn't become a masochistic pig for Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why… I'm sorry. I can't go out with you." Keiki finished telling Yuika his feelings. She stood up and gave him a glance that made it clear she still didn't feel satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that all?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that the only reason why you rejected such a cute Kouhai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell Yuika. With your own mouth." "…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't the place to hide it any longer, and the girl knew that. That was why she wanted to hear it. Even more than that, Keiki didn't want to lie to someone who had confessed with all her heart. Even if someone ends up hurt, even if someone ends up crying, his feelings wouldn't change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have someone I like."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">This afterword will contain spoilers, so proceed with caution.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you very much for buying the 11th volume of HenSuki. This time, Keiki decided on his response to his Kouhai's confession. How did you enjoy it? The 10th volume ended with all the people from the student council, and the 11th volume delivers the all-stars of the calligraphy club again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oddly enough, with everything that has happened, it makes me feel that maybe the protagonist became the biggest pervert, but that's probably just my imagination, right? I mean, first the dream, then being sandwiched by breasts… I guess any healthy boy would surely enjoy that.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, my favorite scene in this volume is probably Yuika-chan in her bear pajamas. Yuika-chan is really cute, and the color illustration has healed my heart. It made me want to get a hugging pillow of her like that, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one who thought that. I hope that the other girls will wear some bear pajamas at some point as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for the cover illustration, Sayuki-senpai took the spotlight this time, as well as several scenes in the volume overall. Her best scene probably was the one in the cabin for me. It made me realize that the girls of the calligraphy club are all cute in their own right. And this very Sayuki-senpai will graduate soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the time from Christmas Eve to the first shrine visit, all the way into the start of the third semester, the protagonist finally came up with one answer. Now that he understands his own feelings, who exactly will be the target of them? And how will Yuika-chan act from here on out? What will happen to the de-perversion plan?</p>
<p class="null-p">There are still many unanswered questions related to the protagonist and the heroines, so I hope you stay with them until the very end.</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, let us meet again in the 12th volume. Hanama Tomo</p>
