<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the latter half of August, and towards the end of summer break.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki opened his eyes, he was greeted by a girl, who was lying next to him in his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wrapped in a pink pyjamas, the girl who was letting out sleeping sounds was Kiryuu Mizuha. Bearing the same name as Kiryuu Keiki, she was his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, she should be his little sister, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why am I this excited by my little sister's sleeping face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had seen that sleeping face countless times already. Until now, he hadn't felt this way, because the other person was his little sister Mizuha. But Keiki knew very well why that had changed. He remembered back to that incident at the pool. Inside the pool building, on the staircase to the second floor, he had flipped up her skirt. Of course, his goal wasn't sexual harassment. It was to find out if he was wearing 'Cinderella's panties' that had disappeared from his room. And, just as he had suspected, Mizuha turned out to be his Cinderella. She was indeed wearing those pure white panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had turned out to be the Cinderella who Keiki had been searching for for so long.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until then, everything was good, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they had a short exchange, until Mizuha suddenly pressed her lips against Keiki's. That soft feeling, and the girl's body heat, together with her soft aroma… everything was burned into this memory of his first kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he remembered the kiss with Mizuha, Keiki writhed in agony on top of the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, why is Mizuha in my bed? …Ah, don't tell me, we crossed that line last night?! No wait, I would surely remember something like that-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Mizuha slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she looked at Keiki, she started smiling, and…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san… Kiss"</p>
<p class="null-p">She suddenly overlapped her lips with Keiki's. Just like the time at the pool, it was a sweet, so sweet, lovers-like kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ehehehe, I did it again," Mizuha giggled with an embarrassed smile as she separated her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Keiki's face went stiff.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………E…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Emergency family meeeeeeeeeeeting!!!!!!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that, an emergency early-morning family meeting began.</p>
<p class="null-p">The participants were Keiki and his little sister, sitting on the bed, facing each other. Of course, the topic was the ongoing lack of morals inside the family.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From this point onward, kisses are prohibited, Mizuha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't 'Ehhh' me. Why did you even snuggle into my bed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was lonely, after all. Nii-san has been so distant from me recently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I would be after suddenly being kissed by my little sister…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was confessed to by his little sister at the pool, and his first kiss was suddenly stolen too, so of course that would make any boy confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I don't think that kissing the boy I love is wrong, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you going to marry another girl besides me, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I can be quite the devoted type."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki knew that very well. After all, she would always cook for him, and she was very good at housework. When she found porn magazines in her older brother's room, she still smiled at him, did everything she could for him, and most importantly, wasn't perverted at all. To many boys, she would be the perfect type of girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, Mizuha is cute, and I think that you're very charming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she was praised, Mizuha's cheeks started turning red. Seeing that, he felt the strong urge to hug her immediately. That's how cute she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even if you ask me to suddenly develop romantic feelings like that… Mizuha is still my little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're not related by blood, though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the main problem. After she confessed to him at the pool, Keiki did indeed call his father to make sure that she wasn't lying, and he had confirmed it. On that day, he found out that Mizuha was actually his sister-in-law.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we're not blood-related, we can do perverted stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perverted stuff?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, Nii-san hasn't been confessed to by any girl other than me, right? Since I also stole your first kiss, choosing me wouldn't be a bad idea, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san… do you hate me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like that is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course he didn't hate her. It would be fine to say that he loved her, and treasured her. However, that feeling was only familial love, and not love towards a person of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love Nii-san, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She once more directly confessed her romantic feelings for Keiki. "Though Nii-san might only see me as a little sister right now, I've always seen Nii-san as a normal boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, my breasts are also pretty big, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I wouldn't choose girls because of their breast size."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But all the porn magazines that you have are full of girls with big breasts, though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you know that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sometimes left them lying on top of your bed, you know? You didn't hide them properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm very sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, truth be told, at the day at the pool, Keiki had indeed found out that her breasts were the second largest out of the four of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're interested… Do you want to cop a feel?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably realized that he was staring at her chest. While kneeling on the bed, she stretched out her hands and hugged Keiki tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mizuha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How are they? I think that they're pretty fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that right now?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't dare say it out loud, but the breasts that were pressing against him really were horrifically voluptuous. Their soft volume was directly transmitted, even through her thin clothing. Keiki knew very well that his heart shouldn't be beating as fast as it currently was, but he couldn't stop it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha let out a soft giggle, and rubbed her cheek on his chest. With this cute gesture, he felt like something very important inside of him was about to break.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this? This is really bad! I might actually die from her cuteness!</p>
<p class="null-p">This clearly surpassed the level of just being very close siblings. Indeed, they weren't connected by blood, but Keiki still thought of her as his little sister. If he was continuously kissed by her like that, or hugged like that, he would surely eventually start thinking things like "My little sister wouldn't be too bad, I guess?", and just imagining it made Keiki shiver from a terrible feeling of guilt.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to avoid this result, Keiki had to take more drastic measures. Before his rational thinking reached its limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He softly grabbed her shoulders and pushed her away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Mizuha's going to fight like that, then I have my own idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idea?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To Mizuha, who was staring at him, he declared his resolve with a strong voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san… Will run away from home!"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: And like that, the older brother decided to run away</p>
<p class="null-p">The day he was kissed by his little sister. After returning to his own room, Keiki immediately called his parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Yeah, yeah, helloooo?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, Dad?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa?! Wait what, why are you panicking like this? You see, I'm the middle of my job right now~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care about that at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh, isn't that a bit too cruel?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have something important to talk about. I'll just be as direct as possible but… Are Mizuha and I only siblings-in-law?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah, yeah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So flippant?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the heaviness of this information, Keiki couldn't back his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is Mizuha my sister-in-law?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No wait, you don't remember?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, well it makes sense. Both you and Mizuha were really young at the time… Actually, Mizuha is the daughter of a dear friend of your mother. I guess it's been around 10 years already. You see, Mizuha lost both of her parents in an accident. Since she didn't have any other relatives, we decided to take her in."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's parents had passed away in an accident. Hearing of his precious little sister's past, Keiki's chest hurt immensely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So basically, Mizuha was adopted?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's exactly right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you never tell me something important like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because there was no need for it. Even if we're not related by blood, she was a full-fledged member of our family. Both me and</p>
<p class="null-p">Mother thought of her as a real daughter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And to be honest, a daughter is cuter than a son, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't want to hear that at all!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Overwhelmed by anger, Keiki cut the call. For a second, he had actually thought that his father was cool. But not after that last piece of unnecessary information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So we really aren't related by blood…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he had confirmation from his parents, there was no need to doubt it anymore. Keiki and Mizuha weren't related at all. It sounded absolutely impossible, but he had to accept it. The most prominent proof was probably that they didn't look like each other in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki looked average, while Mizuha was an incomparable beauty. The older brother's hair was straight, while the little sister's hair had lovable curls. Even that kid they had met in the park a while ago said that they didn't look like each other at all. And ever since he had walked in on Mizuha when she was in the middle of changing in the bathroom, he couldn't help but feel nervous around her. Thinking about it, Keiki's body had probably always seen her as a member of the opposite sex, instead of as his little sister. Feeling your heart skip a beat because of the opposite sex is a completely normal reaction. "Haaaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a long sigh, Keiki collapsed onto his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I never expected my little sister to be Cinderella…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He also never suspected that she was adopted and wasn't his blood-related little sister at all. So much information assaulted his brain that he couldn't come up with anything. Nevertheless, Keiki had to think about the love letter again.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how cute she is, Mizuha is still my little sister-</p>
<p class="null-p">With these thoughts in mind, he wanted to respond properly to Mizuha's confession. Of course, he couldn't have anticipated that she was actually his adopted sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What in the world should I do now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it okay to go out with her now that they know that they aren't blood-related? Is it okay as long as she's cute?</p>
<p class="null-p">And even if it was technically socially acceptable, what about the feelings of the people involved?</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, even if they tell me that we're not related after all this time…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no way that he would be able to see her as a member of the opposite sex after having lived with her as family members under the same roof for so long.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had been around three months since he found that love letter in the clubroom. He had finally found out that the sender was his little sister, and had even found out that they weren't blood related. But the prince's story with Cinderella was still far from over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around 2 hours had passed since Keiki declared that he was going to run away, and it was now around 10am. Immediately after the stores opened, three figures including Keiki could be seen seated at a restaurant. Across the table from Keiki, the "Akiyama Shouma and Ootori Koharu couple" (temp) was sitting. While the boys we wearing comfortable clothing, Koharu came wearing a water-colored onepiece with a cardigan instead of her usual hoodie. When Keiki called them for assistance, both of them gathered here without complaining at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So just as you had imagined, Kiryuu-kun, your Cinderella was really your little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that Mizuha-chan is actually adopted."</p>
<p class="null-p">After they all had ordered iced coffees, Keiki explained the recent events and the identity of the Cinderella whom he had been looking for for so long. And of course the fact that said Cinderella was actually his little sister. Just like Keiki, both Koharu and Shouma were very surprised by that grand reveal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were living under the same roof for so long without realizing that you weren't related? How idiotic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, now that you say it, you really don't look like siblings at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you both were in the same year, I thought that you were twins."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was totally obvious after I had found out about Cinderella's identity thanks to Koharu-senpai's photo…."</p>
<p class="null-p">The day the letter was left behind in the clubroom, Koharu had taken a photo. Inside said photo Keiki saw Miharu, at a time and place where she should not have been, which was why he was able to deduce that she was Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And when Keiki was about to turn her down, Mizuha-chan revealed that you actually aren't related, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that she stole your first kiss, which resulted in you not being able to answer her. And now your relationship is as awkward as it gets, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's about the sum of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Cinderella turned out to be the prince's little sister… now that's a really novel idea, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Finding out that a family member of more than ten years isn't actually blood-related is just total trouble. And then she confessed her love for me and suddenly kissed me… I have no idea what's happening anymore," Keiki sighed and rested his head on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, from what I can tell, Mizuha-chan is quite the catch, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean yeah, Mizuha is a beauty. She's cute, kind, worries about me, and does a lot of housework, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha is my little sister, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's not blood-related though, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, I can't just see her as a member of the opposite sex." "Well, I guess you're right. It really is a difficult situation."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shouma expressed his sympathy, Koharu spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To me, a forbidden relationship between an older brother and a little sister sounds pretty exciting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai really likes gossip, doesn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Every girl does."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So how far have you gone with Shouma, Koharu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu twitched while sucking on her straw at the sudden change of topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? What's with that reaction? D-Don't tell me, have you already…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl who looked like a grade school student was actually in her third year of high school. Though she doesn't look legal, she was in fact above the age of consent. Since they were a young couple going out with each other, it might be too much for them to handle, and they could have given in to their desires. After going to the beach together, they might have just stayed at a nearby hotel…</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Gulp," Keiki gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of this tense atmosphere, Koharu slowly started talking with flushed cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, a while ago, Shouma-kun kissed me on the cheek!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you a grade schooler or something?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Koharu put both her hands on her cheeks, letting out an embarrassed "Kyaa~~~", and even Keiki had to accept the fact that she looked really cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank God… I was worried that Shouma wouldn't be able to hold himself back if Koharu-senpai showed herself in a swimsuit in front of him…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what kind of monster do you think I am?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a lolicon, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, well, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">The ikemen freely admitted to the title bestowed upon him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, let's get back on topic. Keiki. You're running away from home right now, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I couldn't keep up with it all. I really need some time to think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I wanted to ask Shouma if I could crash at his place for a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really want to help you, but right now, the older brother of my cousin is staying over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… that's not going to happen then, is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently said person was a university student, so he should be on his summer vacation too. Keiki would feel like a total bother if he stayed over at Shouma's house right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what about my house?" Koharu offered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, would that be fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, we have a lot of free rooms."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A home with a lot of free rooms…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what you would expect from the daughter of a company president. The amount of rooms in her home was fundamentally different from a commoner like Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll have take you up on that offer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're going to stay over at Koharu-chan's home…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-?! Is that killing intent I feel?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt murderous intent crawling up his back, and his friend's face entered his view. Shouma had bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Somehow, I feel a stare of envy directed at me, so I might have to decline that offer after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai really is loved~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"???"</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like the relationship between the couple (temporary) was processing quite well. Since Shouma showed this much concern for Koharu, Keiki doubted that the day when they would start going out officially was that far away. And as a friend to both of them, he felt really happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">After bidding farewell to Shouma and Koharu, the runaway young boy was now in a nearby park, lost in thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I ran away in the heat of the moment, but what should I do now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He contemplated this serious problem while sitting on a park bench. Kiryuu Keiki-kun's runaway plan consisted of… nothing at all, and the only items currently in his possession were his smartphone and his slim wallet. Of course, he didn't have enough income to book a room at a hotel to spend the night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's so hot… I miss the AC…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was already August, it had gotten even hotter than before, and the sunlight was burning his skin. The UV index was even higher than usual for this time of year. Normally, Keiki would make his way back to his cool and comfortable home immediately. However, since he was the person who had announced that he was running away, that was something he couldn't do, especially not in a situation like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">I haven't even cleared anything up yet…</p>
<p class="null-p">What should he do now that he had found out that he wasn't actually related to Mizuha?</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of answer should he give in response to her confession?</p>
<p class="null-p">His feelings still weren't cleared up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That reminds me, Mizuha and I ate some ice cream on this very bench before."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was back when Yuika and Mao had joined the calligraphy clubroom. He met Mizuha on his way home from school and decided to buy some ice cream at the shop that had opened close by here recently. At the time, he had no idea that the girl held romantic affection towards her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though we're always together, I didn't understand Mizuha one bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially that smile she always showed him. What kinds of feelings did she have as she continue to live under the same roof as Keiki? Maybe he had only seen one side of Kiryuu Mizuha up until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Oh, if it isn't Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who called out to him was his classmate, Nanjou Mao. She was wearing glasses with plain clothing, and seemed to have given her hair no attention whatsoever that morning. She was carrying a bag from the convenience store in her hand. As if it was the most natural thing to do, she walked up to Keiki and sat down next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing in a place like this, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I could ask the same of Nanjou. I'm not used to seeing you looking like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't stare too much. I can't help it. I pulled an all-nighter last night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"An all-nighter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sort of in a slump with my shoujo manga, you see. When I wanted to try a change of pace, I worked on a BL manga for an event, and before I had realized it, it was already morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, since I had gotten hungry, I went to buy some food."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it, it's almost time for lunch."</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as the word 'lunch' came up, Keiki's stomach started rumbling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you hungry too, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I haven't eaten anything this morning, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I don't have anything but anpan, but you can have some if you'd like."</p>
<p class="null-p">(TLC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anpan)</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nanjou is a goddess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just bread. Not to mention that a goddess wouldn't be wearing a tracksuit like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, both of them started eating their anpan. Maybe it was because he was starving, but Keiki thought that the anpan tasted even more delicious than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Kiryuu, what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anybody would be able to tell that something is off if they saw you sitting here dejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh, actually, there's some weird thing going on between</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha and me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, you had a fight? Since it's Kiryuu we're talking about, you probably did something perverted to Mizuha, right? Peeking while she was taking a bath, sniffing her panties, or something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just who do you think I am?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A hopeless siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't have any rebuttal to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, fights always happen, no matter how close you are. My mom and I often fight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I don't do the laundry right, when the food she makes isn't any good… fights happen a lot because of the smallest reasons.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's something that makes you a family, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha and I have never really fought all that much, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that maybe just because she's been holding back? Mizuha isn't the type of person to be selfish, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You might be right about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The kind, thoughtful Mizuha would never complain or get mad. Just like Mao said, Mizuha never was selfish, nor did she ever ask for anything unreasonable. Even so, she would always stay firm when it came to Keiki. That basically showed just how important Keiki was to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha is pretty popular with the boys, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's not the type to stand out, but she is cute. She's polite, kind to everyone, and the type of person who's liked by both boys and girls. Ever since she entered high school, she's been confessed to countless times."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, she never once accepted any of them, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Ohhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you look like you're relieved? You're such a siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for being a siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">-But I wonder why?</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki imagined the scene of Mizuha getting confessed to, he felt a really unpleasant feeling in his chest. Since this had never happened before, he was also at a loss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I actually need some advice from Kiryuu. Do you mind if I ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Advice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that big of a deal, okay? I would be happy if you gave me a bit of your time, that's all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Yay~!" Mao said with a child-like smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">And before Keiki had a chance to react, a sketchbook and pencil appeared in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll make you pay for the anpan - With your body."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, be obedient and take off your underwear!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Wait a second, what are you saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, you're so dense. I need you to do this so that I can properly draw a penis."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, what are you saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu fu fu… I don't get a chance like this very often. I'll make use of Kiryuu's banana, and turn it into some great material for my new work!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly decline!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you getting embarrassed for? That's weirdly cute, you know? Kehehehehe. I'll make you strip even if you don't want to!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good. Is she completely off her rocker because of her all-nighter?! W-Wait! Don't put your hand on my pants!"</p>
<p class="null-p">People who are suffering from sleep deprivation have a high chance of losing their grip on reality. She was pretty weird normally, but the current Mao-sensei was in even greater spirits than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it fine isn't it fine~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before his female classmate was able to pull down his pants in a public park, Keiki desperately ran away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaah… Haaah… I wasted precious energy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Around 5 minutes had passed. Keiki put one hand on a telephone pole to steady himself and deep breaths. Luckily, the fujoshi wasn't chasing after him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why did I even run away from home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did Keiki run away - from Mizuha? The reason for all of it was because she turned out to be his Cinderella. After he found out that his longed-for Cinderella was his little sister, he was confessed to by her, and he found out that they weren't actually connected by blood. Since she had confessed, they wouldn't be able to return to their previous relationship. Whether he accepted her feelings or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wouldn't be able to treat her the same way he did before. They probably wouldn't be able to return to being normal siblings. Realizing that was more painful than Keiki had ever imagined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see. I'm just scared of giving her an honest answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">The time he had spent with Mizuha was so much of a blessing that he had believed it would last forever. However, finding out that she was Cinderella had brought those peaceful days to an end. Whatever answer Keiki came up with, their current relationship would shatter, never to be repaired again. Even though he should've been able to make up his mind when he confronted her that day at the pool. But he didn't even give her a response.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki had even realized it was cloudy, it had started raining.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rain, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though the weather had been so sunny and hot earlier, the sky had suddenly turned an ominous grey, and the world was wrapped in darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki didn't have an umbrella. He couldn't exactly check the weather forecast this morning, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I'll go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, the young boy's running away from home ended after around half a day. Of course, he was completely drenched by the time he got back home.</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning, Keiki was lying down on his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-38.5 degrees. You have quite the fever," Mizuha said in a worried tone after checking the thermometer.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for his cold was without a doubt the rain from the previous day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made some rice porridge, so try to eat a bit. If not, you can't take your medicine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm sorry, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're sick, so it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">With her usual kind smile, she started feeding him some porridge. Keiki didn't even have the energy to feel embarrassed about it, so he allowed himself to be fed, drank the medicine, and laid down again. When he closed his eyes, he could hear the faint rain still coming down outside. Since it had been raining since the previous morning, it was colder than you would expect it to be, since this August had been rather warm so far. Or maybe it only felt cold because his body was undergoing a fever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…My head hurts… I'll just sleep…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the comfy blanket that Mizuha had given him, Keiki slipped away into the land of dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when Keiki opened his eyes again, it was already past noon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What greeted him wasn't his little sister sitting next to the bed, but a girl with long black hair. She was wearing a skirt and a matching blouse. Politely sitting on a pillow, Tokihara Sayuki noticed that Keiki had opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you're awake. How are you feeling?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… a little bit better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, why are you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I met Mizuha-san in the supermarket. She told me that Keiki-kun had gotten a cold. Ah, Mizuha-san should be making some lunch right now. She really is a wonderful little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right… She is."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since his parents had gotten too busy to stay at home, Mizuha would always look after Keiki when he caught a cold. Remembering those times, he felt his chest getting warm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I will be nursing Keiki-kun until lunch is done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, there's no need for Senpai to go this far…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. We have to help each other out when we're in trouble. I'll start nursing you immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, Sayuki stood up and took off her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?! What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What am I doing…? I'm taking off my panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In order to help Keiki-kun regain his energy. There's no way that a boy wouldn't get his energy back after receiving a girl's freshly-worn panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Panties aren't some sort of energy drink, you know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, enjoy my panties to your heart's content. You can sniff them, lick them, or even try putting them on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible… I thought that Keiki would totally be the type to bite into them with no remorse at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what kind of opinion do you have of me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. It seems like panties were the wrong choice. Then would this be the right way to go about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right way to go about what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll just do this."</p>
<p class="null-p">After pulling her panties back on, Sayuki snuggled up in the blanket next to Keiki, like a cat who wanted to be spoiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai… What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're sleeping together. Since it's a bit cold today, I'm going to warm my master up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that it's warmer this way, but still…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Until lunch is ready, we can just relax a bit like this. I'll do this for you until you fall asleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't sure if it was because of the embarrassment or the tension, but Keiki was now wide awake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, Keiki-kun, your face is getting red, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whose fault do you think that is…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His complaint was ignored, and Sayuki started stroking Keiki's hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun. When we were at the pool, you saved me when my bikini top got washed away, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, something like that happened, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">When the whole crew had gone to the pool, he tried to hide Sayuki's bare upper body by tightly hugging her. In retrospect, that was quite a bold move from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're always saving me. You saved me when the calligraphy club was about to be abolished, and you saved me that time at the pool. I can't do anything but calligraphy, and I can't cook like Mizuha-san. Staying by your side like this is probably the only thing I can do. I want to do something for Keiki-kun, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words echoed inside Keiki's head. He was unable to give up on her entirely precisely because she said things like this from time to time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So If Keiki-kun wishes for it, you can even bury your face into my breasts, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please give me back my admiration. But if that's the case, then can you stroke my head a bit more?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your wish is my command."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming to be happy that she had the chance to spoil him, she had a gleeful smile on her face. Keiki was about to close his eyes and give in to the warmth surrounding him-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Suuu… Suuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai completely fell asleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">It had only been a few moments since they had started lying next to each other. While Keiki was busy thinking about how to deal with this situation, the door to the room slightly opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, are you awake?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The worst timing possible. What his little sister could plainly see was her beloved older brother sleeping with a back-haired beauty next to him. After an awkward pause, Mizuha, holding the tray with Keiki's lunch on it, turned around on her heel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please take your time~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong! You're really, really wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Stopped by her older brother's desperate plea, Mizuha let out a sigh and turned around once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, how did it come to this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai just did this on her own. Don't tell me… Are you mad, Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really. It's Nii-san's business after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, you have to hurry and eat so that you can take your medicine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With this tension-filled atmosphere, Keiki ate some dinner. After making sure that he had swallowed the medicine, Mizuha took the tableware with her and left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ahh, my head is spinning again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he didn't have that much of an appetite, he couldn't eat much dinner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hadn't gotten a cold since he became a high school student, so he had completely forgotten what it felt like. By the way, Sayuki was still next to him, sound asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's just doing her own thing as usual…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he started poking at the girl's cheeks, the door once more opened and a girl with a small stature poked her face in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yuika heard that you weren't feeling well, but you seem to be in high spirits like usual."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Koga Yuika, a fellow member of the library committee, and Keiki's kouhai. She had blonde hair, and she looked straight at Keiki with her blue eyes as she entered the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you do something with Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't do anything. She just crawled into my bed and fell asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika-chan, why are you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika got a email from Witch-senpai saying that Keiki-senpai wasn't feeling well, so she came to check on him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just a cold, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't pretend to be better than you are. Keiki-senpai looks terrible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well yeah, I'm really not feeling up to much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, you really became a weakling… But a Senpai like this isn't too bad, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, sorry. I don't feel like playing along with that at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having been restrained by that phrase, the girl quietly sat down next to the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, Yuika has brought you some souvenirs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't have to do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no, Yuika thought of bringing them now that Senpai is so weak."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Yuika took out of her bag was a red collar. For some reason, it was the sort of collar that you would see on a dog's neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A collar for pets."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll ask this up front, but why a collar?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Just leave everything to Yuika. She will personally turn you into a proper pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly is fine about this?! It doesn't feel like there's anything fine at all?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should Yuika put it on you herself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't wear it, okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His Kouhai was as crazy as ever. She's crazy enough to try to force her male Kouhai to wear something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, Yuika is only joking about the collar. This is what she brought for real."</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting the collar away, Yuika took out several paperback books.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have a a lot of free time when you're sick, after all. That's why Yuika chose the books that Senpai was most likely to enjoy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, there are actually books that curse you when you read them, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't waste them on me. Take those ones back home with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Please give them a try~ If you do, you might be unable to go to the toilet at night just like Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a shame, but Yuika can't help it, it seems. How about we finally wake up that big-breasted ghost over there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The blonde-haired girl lifted herself up and stood up next to the bed. She grabbed the shoulders of the sleeping upperclassmen-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Here we go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">-And pulled Sayuki off the bad with all her might.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After falling to the floor, Sayuki's eyes shot open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing, really…?" Sayuki rubbed her butt as she slowly got up.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Yuika flashed a victorious smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Just when I was wondering who it was. It's Koga-san. Why are you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wasn't Witch-senpai the one who sent Yuika the email? 'Since</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki-kun can't resist today, we can do whatever we want,' it said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't look at me with those eyes, Keiki-kun. It was just a joke," Sayuki averted her eyes when Keiki glared at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, Yuika will be the one taking over the duty of nursing Keiki-senpai. This big-breasted useless girl can go home already, since she wasn't helping at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You two. Can you not start a fight right here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tension started to fill the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. How about a truce for as long as Keiki-senpai isn't feeling well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say that, but what exactly are you doing, Koga-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika climbed onto the bad and hugged Keiki's arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, this time Yuika will be sleeping together with you, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will be the one to warm Keiki-kun up, like a loyal pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because she didn't want to lose to her Kouhai, Sayuki followed suit and grabbed Keiki's other arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun? You like big breasts, so you won't be satisfied by Koga-san, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really deserve the name 'Witch-senpai!' Are you trying to seduce Keiki-senpai with your body?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them started fighting while lying next to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… I'm actually sick right now, so can you fight somewhere else, please?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His body started feeling even more hot, and he could feel his soul leaving his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-A flower in either hand, I see, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_9.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">All of a sudden, the door opened, and Mizuha was standing in the doorway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, you two. We wouldn't want this poor Nii-san to suffer any more than he has to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's also true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you two listen to Mizuha and not me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since neither of them had listened to him at all, Keiki was still less than satisfied. Whatever the reason, he had been saved from that situation thanks to Mizuka, and could now let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki had a dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an incident that occurred more than 10 years ago, when Keiki was still only 4 years old. On a certain day, his parents suddenly came home with a girl he had never seen before. She looked to be about the same age like Keiki. His father said "This girl will become a part of our family from today onwards."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Family?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Since your birthday is before hers, she will be your little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Little sister…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki looked at the girl again, she whispered these words with a sad expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, Keiki didn't know why she had suddenly become family, or why she had made such a face. But he didn't want the girl to keep making that face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's your name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, huh? I'm Keiki. Mizuha's Onii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onii…chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm your Onii-chan. Since we're family now, we'll be always together from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Always……….together……" Mizuha looked dumbfounded as she opened her mouth. "…Wahhhhhh…!" And she suddenly started crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Huh? Why are you crying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki panicked, trying to stop her from crying. He didn't know why the girl was crying. Since he was just a child, he could only softly stroke her hair and try to comfort her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the first memory Keiki had of Mizuha. The long-ago day on which they became family. The day they became siblings. A very important memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened his eyes, bright moonlight peeked through the gaps of the curtains. He forced his body to stand up inside the dark room and reminisced about the dream he had just had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did I forget about that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The dream was about the first time that Keiki and Mizuha had met.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the time, I told Mizuha that I would become her Onii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wanting that sad expression to turn into a smile, he had said those words. When she started crying, Keiki could only stroke her hair and try to calm her down. In response, she stopped crying, and she hadn't separated from him for quite some time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, that had probably been right after the girl lost her parents. Her parents must've meant everything to a small child like her. Since she had lost her everything, it wouldn't have been odd for her heart to break into pieces. The girl must surely still remember that scene as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I've decided. From now on, I'll stay as Mizuha's Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, they had been living under the same roof as family. For more than ten years, they were family.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if we're not related by blood, Mizuha and I are family. We're siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">This has to be the right choice, Keiki thought. When morning came, he would act as an older brother, the same as always. Though they might not go back to exactly how they were, he wanted to make an honest effort. He wanted to make sure that they both could continue being close siblings just like they were before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Still, what a weird time to be so clear-headed."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he checked the time, it was 1 am in the morning. Since he had slept since lunch, his body felt better and his fever had gone down drastically.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll go wash my face."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he wanted to take a shower, he decided not to since he still wasn't completely better yet. After stepping out of his room, Keiki headed towards the bathroom. He went down the stairs and opened the door. "…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was this late, there was still a light on in there. When he looked around, he saw a naked girl, having apparently just finished her bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them froze and stared at each other. Returning back to her senses a bit faster than Keiki, Mizuha hid her body with the towel in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, s-sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after, Keiki also realized the situation he was in, and hurriedly turned his back to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm really sorry. I didn't think that you would be taking a bath this late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah… It's okay. I'm fine if it's Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you can get angry at me. It was my fault."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't. It's embarrassing, but I don't mind being seen by the person I like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, uhm… Thanks for the treat…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki became flustered by Mizuha's bold words. Even if an older brother shouldn't ever get excited by his little sister's naked body, he couldn't stop his heart from racing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'll be waiting in the hallway, so call me when you're ready," Keiki said and left.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stood outside the bathroom in the hallway and rested his back against the closed door, trying to cool his head. Though he could hear the sound of rustling clothes behind him, he tried not to think about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Nii-san, is it fine for you to be up already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, yeah, my fever went down quite a lot, so it's all good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then it's fine, but don't overdo it, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ahh, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">While they were talking through the door, Keiki realized why she was taking a shower this late. She had probably been watching over him, always by his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ahh, yeah, I know. I won't exert myself too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm, it seems like you understand," Mizuha said with in a satisfied tone. She then changed the topic. "But still, you must be very lucky to have a flower in each hand like you did this afternoon. Any boy would be envious of you sleeping with those two cute girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, I wasn't even able to enjoy it at all because of the heat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder about that. You didn't seem all too displeased."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to be quite displeased, Mizuha-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Not really."</p>
<p class="null-p">This way of talking was pretty rare for her. And she had been like this ever since Sayuki and Yuika went home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I recall correctly, something similar happened before when both of them came over to play. Mizuha was weirdly displeased, and she said something like 'Nii-san is my Nii-san only, okay?'. It was so cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Are you there? Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he called out to the girl who had suddenly become quiet, the door opened. The sight that greeted him was Mizuha, wearing a shirt and shorts. Her face seemed to be somewhere between a frown and a pout as she focused her gaze on Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the time, I thought that they were going to take Nii-san away from me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Ohh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, he would take these words to be a conformation of love for her older brother, but now that he knew her real feelings, he understood their true meaning. She was nervous to see her loved one being lovey-dovey with other girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? For what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the reason why Nii-san caught a cold. Because I was being selfish, Nii-san ran away and got wet because of the rain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that was because I wasn't acting like a grown-up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But please don't worry. I won't kiss you anymore if you dislike it that much. We can just do it even more once I've gotten Nii-san to fall in love with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That soft smile of hers tugged on Keiki's heartstrings. Keiki thought that this honesty was the most charming part of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that reminds me. Can I use the prize for that pool competition now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that order."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had thought of a prize to make everyone take part in a competition at the pool. This prize was the right to say an order that Keiki had to follow. And since Mizuha was the winner, she had won the right to order anything she wanted from Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll say this up front. I won't give you my savings. I won't crawl around the city on my hands and knees. I won't do anything like that, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't ask for something that weird," Mizuha said with a bitter smile and a deep breath afterwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">She lifted her head and gave her order with a serious face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just for tomorrow, please become by boyfriend. I want you to go on a date with me. Not as siblings, but as lovers."</p>
<p class="null-p">After she finished saying her piece, Mizuha's cheeks were coloured a vivid red. You could clearly tell that this was the gaze of a maiden in love who wished to spend time with her beloved-</p>
<p class="null-p">Again, why is my heart beating so fast…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though this was his little sister. The girl who had been his family for as long as he could remember. At that moment, Keiki felt the decision he had made inside his heart starting to crumble.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: He's my Nii-san but it doesn't matter if there's love, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was 8am, and Mizuha's figure could be spotted in the bathroom. After putting in the hot water and adding some bath salts, Mizuha slowly stepped in and let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Taking a bath this early in the morning, am I? I must really be motivated."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though there were times when she would take a bath this early, she wouldn't warm up the water this much. After all, that would be a waste if you considered the cost of electricity and such. But there was a reason why this economist Mizuha was taking a bath right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine. After all, today I'm going on a date with Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her plans for today were a date with Keiki. That was why she was taking a bath this early and thoroughly washing her body. She wanted to make herself look as cute as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I really love Nii-san a bit too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">If someone called her a brocon, she wouldn't be able to deny it. And also, they weren't actually siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Siblings, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">An older brother and a younger sister. This was Keiki's and Mizuha's relationship. Exactly because she knew that this love wasn't normal, she felt anxious. Even if she tried to convince herself with "It's not wrong at all", even if they weren't related by blood, she had wondered countless times if her feelings really should be allowed to exist. Countless times including now. However, she decided to stop hiding her feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">After making up her mind, she pushed herself up out of the bathtub. Though she knew that walking around the house with her current lack of clothing was more than idencent, she had told her older brother to wait for her at the meeting place, so it should be fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, she properly dried her hair. After that, she put on some pink underwear and stood in front of the full-body mirror, holding the clothes that she had decided upon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wonder if Nii-san will call me cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the back of her mind, that worry was constantly nagging her. And although she felt scared from thinking about the possible reactions from her loved one, she still looked forward to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the morning of the date. Keiki was sitting on a bench in front of the train station in a huge, wide open space. Today's weather was perfect. A bright, blue sky with no clouds in sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that the day would come when I would go on a date with my little sister…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His plans for the day were to go on a date with his little sister Mizuha. Of course, there were countless times when he had gone out with her before. Such as going out to watch a movie together, helping her with the shopping, or going to a café to enjoy some tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that it had been revealed that they weren't related by blood, and he had found out about the girl's feelings, Keiki was painfully aware that this date today held a very special meaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But his question just disappeared into the wind, with no one able to answer him. And while he was waiting for the person he was thinking about…</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Sorry for making you wait, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">He heard a voice that was colored with tension and anxiety. When he lifted his head, he saw a cute looking girl. She was wearing a long, high-fitting tunic with matching shorts, and she had a clover necklace around her neck. Not knowing what to say, Keiki just stared at Mizuha, entranced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How… is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-Bery cuteo…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In English, if possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that it looks very cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehehe. I wanted Nii-san to call me cute. That's why I worked really hard on it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guha?!"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_10.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">When she grinned happily, the overwhelming cuteness of Mizuha sent a shock through Keiki's body and he had to stabilize himself by holding his knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I think I might be disqualified to be an Onii-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Keiki had underestimated Mizuha's fighting strength. After receiving this much damage, Keiki was unable to get up for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">And like that, his date with his little sister started. As a side note, the reason that they hadn't left their house together was because Mizuha had requested it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'll feel more like a date if we meet up somewhere," Were her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki for his part could understand where she was coming from.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they travelled by train to the next city over, Mizuha suddenly turned around when they stepped out of the train station.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today on this date, I will make you fall head over heels for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Goho?! …P-Please take it easy on me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was probably planning to be extremely aggressive today. She was already cute when she just kept quiet, but these surprise attacks were clearly tearing at Keiki's reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So where do you want to go today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… I was thinking of watching a movie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I guess we'll do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but I want to watch it somewhere other than the cinema."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… A manga café."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Mizuha had asked for it, Keiki didn't protest and they made their way towards a manga café near them. A manga café has unlimited manga, unlimited internet access, and an unlimited supply of drinks at the drink bar, making it a small paradise for the average young person. And from what he had heard, you could also watch movies on the computers there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Two highschool students for two hours please."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha reserved their room in a dignified manner, and they were led to it. The room looked like it had been specially made for couples. It contained a small sofa and one desktop PC with two pairs of headphones. And, it was narrow. Very narrow. The room barely fit two people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is the rumoured couple suite, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, Nii-san, hurry and sit down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After standing there astonished for a moment, he went deeper into the room and sat down next to Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They have a lot of different things here, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, do you go here often?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just when I have the time. What movie should we watch?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll leave that to Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha skillfully operated the PC and scrolled through the various movies displayed on the screen. There really was a lot of variety. From action to romance, fantasy to comedy, documentaries to films from overseas.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, is the AC not working? It's pretty hot in here, don't you think?" Mizuha asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I think that it's rather cool in he-re?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason his voice had suddenly cracked was because something unexpected entered his line of sight. While still going through the list of movies, Mizuha had opened up the collar of her clothes and started fanning herself. Because of that, her pink underwear was in plain sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing at all?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? -Ah, this one might be good. I've been wanting to watch it for a while, but haven't had the time to watch it yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Then let's do that!" He practically squeaked as he looked away from the girl's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, why a manga café? A cinema would've been enough, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After starting the movie, Mizuha leaned against Keiki's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In here, we can cling to each other as much as we want, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had liked movies since she was a small kid, and they had watched movies all the time while sitting on the couch. But this was the first time that both of them were watching a movie while sitting this close to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Somehow, it feels like we're lovers…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, it's really exciting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then the movie started, and they both watched it in silence. Inside this small cinema with just the two of them. Since Mizuha immediately put her hand on top of Keiki's, he was conscious of her throughout the whole movie, and afterwards he didn't even remember what it was about.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next destination they headed towards was the same shopping mall Keiki had visited on his date with Yuika. After eating a light lunch at a fast food restaurant, they started window shopping. Just walking past and looking at the different stores on both sides of the walkway was plenty interesting already. Aside from various restaurants, there were bookstores, CD and DVD stores, perfume shops, and even shops for rock climbing gear. If there was anything you wanted or needed, you could surely find it here.</p>
<p class="null-p">The shops that Mizuha frequently stopped at were tableware or tea shops. It seemed that her heart longed for household materials, rather than make-up and accessories. Keiki thought that this said a lot about her as a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, Nii-san, it says that no dirt will get stuck on this ladle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's weird for a girl like you to say that with a serious face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did that make me sound like an old lady?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I think that it's amazing how excited you are about household stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was that a proposal? Are you asking me to become your wife?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's for Nii-san, I can make delicious miso soup every day, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not really any different from how it is right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost all the food that Keiki ate was actually made by Mizuha. Even the lunch he ate at school. Of course, Mizuha had taken note of everything he liked and disliked when it came to food, so everything she made perfectly fit Keiki's tastes. If he were to accept Mizuha's feelings, and marry her in the future, this kind of lifestyle would probably continue forever-</p>
<p class="null-p">While he pondered about it, Keiki thought that it sounded very blissful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…A future like that wouldn't be too bad, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just thought that Mizuha might make a great wife. If there was an official certification for being a wonderful wife, Mizuha would surely attain it in her first try."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you're not trying to cover something up, are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Am not."</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't say that he was imagining a future where he married his little sister. And he didn't want to give her any false hopes, since he hadn't given her an answer to her confession yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they had finished walking through the rows of household wares, they left the store.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The second they stepped out into the main walkway again, Mizuha stopped in her tracks. Past her gaze was a young couple holding hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should we also hold hands?" Keiki asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why? We did it a lot when we were kids, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is different from back then. Even if we're not related, we're still siblings. If someone we know sees us, they might get the wrong idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind, but I would hate to be a bother to Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She would hate to be a bother to Keiki-</p>
<p class="null-p">That's probably why she chose the manga café instead of the cinema. To make sure that Keiki wouldn't be embarrassed if someone they knew saw them. It's true that there might be people who would glare at him with suspicion if he went on a date with his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even if she did it for him, he couldn't bear seeing a lonely expression on her face like that. He didn't even have to think about what was more important: His appearance in the eyes of society, or this girl's smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing next to her, Keiki took Mizuha's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, N-Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care either if they get the wrong idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she was surprised for a second, she tightly gripped his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's exactly because of these sorts of things that I fell in love with</p>
<p class="null-p">Nii-san, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That smile Mizuha returned was as brilliant as her words, and Keiki changed the topic out of embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But still, I never expected Mizuha to be the one who sent me the love letter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I never thought that the day would come when Nii-san would forcefully lift up my skirt like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really feel bad about that, but I had no other way to find out if you really were Cinderella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said it at the pool before, but what's with this 'Cinderella' thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You left your panties and the love letter in the clubroom, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">So we decided to call the mysterious sender of the love letter 'The</p>
<p class="null-p">Cinderella who dropped her panties'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's what it was… What a horrible name, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? Shouma thought of it, but it's too crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Cinderella who dropped her panties in the clubroom. That girl was currently walking next to her prince, giggling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait a second… I never asked her what those panties were about.</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot had happened, and he had completely forgotten about it, but this was the only mystery he hadn't solved up until now. Even know, the prince didn't know the reason why Cinderella had left her panties behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Mizuha. Those panties…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ohya? If it isn't Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was interrupted by a familiar voice. When he looked over at the source of that voice, he was greeted by a big-breasted, blackhaired beauty who was wearing a t-shirt and jeans.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence meeting you here. Could this be destiny?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it really is nothing more than a coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are no fun. Are you out shopping?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah, uh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're on a date today."</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who answered the question was Mizuha. Not to mention that she did so while tightly clinging to Keiki's arm. Keiki wondered if it was his imagination, but he thought that Mizuha sounded a bit aggressive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, is that so? Fufu, you two are as close as ever," Sayuki said as she returned a warm gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl doesn't know that Keiki and Mizuha aren't related by blood. Even though Mizuha was clinging tightly to Keiki's arm, to her it looked like nothing more than siblings being close to one another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Sayuki-senpai here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm out buying ink and other club materials."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could've just told me, and I would have come helped carry them for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then can I ask you to come with me right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today is a bit inconvenient."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah. You're on a date with your beloved little sister, after all. Really, Keiki-kun is just as much of an siscon as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… Can you not call me a siscon in a place like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I'll ask you to help me again at a later time. As for the reward… let's see, I'll let you touch my body wherever you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… was that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong. Nii-san didn't think about that at all," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah it is, so please don't look at me with those cold eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Nii-san's gaze is directly focused on Senpai's chest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed, Keiki-kun's gaze was directed straight at my chest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't help it… That's just how all men work…"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the contrary, it would be rude not to appreciate a good chest. But alas, the girls didn't understand that feeling at all, and Mizuha separated a few steps from Keiki. Not just with her body, but it also felt like she took a step back emotionally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you idiot…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mizuha? Where are you going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Toilet," Mizuha said, clearly displeased, as she walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like I was being a bother, so I'll excuse myself for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you even talk to us if you knew that you were going to be a bother…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, both of you looked so close, so of course I would be jealous," Sayuki said with a pout.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jealous…? Mizuha is my little sister, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter who it is. You can't analyse a young maiden's heart with logic. If you don't understand that, you'll stay a virgin forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being a virgin doesn't have anything to do with that, though?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph. Whatever."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sticking out her tongue in a cute manner, the upperclassmen walked away. And as he watched her walk away, Keiki let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then… How should I apologize to Mizuha when she comes back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he was basically baited into it, the reason that she was mad was because Keiki had stared at Sayuki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, the porn magazines in my room are fine, but her breasts aren't? I really don't get her mindset… Whatever the case, the question is: What I should do now? Hmmm, should I try to appeal to her and say that I couldn't help it? Or should I tell Mizuha how much I love her breasts? …I feel like that would have the opposite effect, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he knew the reason why she was mad, he didn't know how to solve it. Since Mizuha rarely got mad, he didn't know how to quell her anger. But then again, that was the real pleasure of going on dates. Namely, find out about a new side of the other person. Even if it was unpleasant information, Keiki thought that it was important to find out more about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">They'd lived under the same roof for years, yet there were still sides of her that he didn't know about.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mizuha returned, Keiki and Mizuha went into a café inside the mall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh, umm… Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you mad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she said that, she was slurping on the straw in her café au lait with a rather displeased expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that Nii-san likes big breasts, and I don't mind it all that his gaze was glued to Tokihara-senpai's chest. Not in the slightest. Not a single bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You clearly do mind, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, how can I help you cheer up again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That depends on how hard Nii-san wants to try."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Keiki, it felt like he was being tested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. Today, I'll do everything that Mizuha wants me to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Men don't go back on their words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… There's a place I want to go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A place you want to go? Eh? -Wait, Mizuha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he was grabbed by Mizuha, she dragged him out of the café.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? Here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but… isn't this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't be blamed for being taken aback. After all, this was a place that a male like him should never enter. Countless panties and bras were lined up on the shelves - It was a lingerie shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want Nii-san to choose some underwear for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No seriously, what did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to tell me your favorite type of underwear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For when the time comes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What time?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyways, go~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait! This really isn't a place that a man like me should enter!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's something completely normal to do if we're lovers, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Do men with girlfriends really have it that easy in today's world? That's quite the shock for me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, something like this was completely normal for couples. That was quite the culture shock for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No wait! Even if it's something totally normal for couples, we're siblings, right? An older brother picking out panties for his little sister is completely perverted!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But today, Nii-san is my boyfriend, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that that's the setup today, but still…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then it's no problem at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that logic a bit too severe?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, didn't you say that you would do anything I wanted today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A man doesn't go back on his words, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's words from before were already coming back to haunt him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…" Mizuha spoke in a sweet voice with watery eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she looked up at him like that, Keiki's stubbornness shattered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay! I get it already, so please don't look at me like a dog that just got scolded by its owner!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When it came down to it, Kiryuu Keiki was a siscon. He would not be able to turn down this request from his cute little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now that it had been decided that he would have to pick out underwear for his little sister, both of them set foot into the lingerie shop. While Keiki walked forward with movements as stiff as a robot, Mizuha seemed completely calm and collected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What kind of development is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Nii-san chose the swimsuit for me when we went to the pool, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a world of difference between swimsuits and underwear. Besides, I had Koharu-senpai there to help me. Even the woman at the register is constantly looking over here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, all of the other customers besides Keiki were young women. And the person in question was starting to become dizzy from all of the underwear around him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, which one would be best?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…A-Aren't those gray ones over there pretty cute?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This? So Nii-san likes them like this..? Then I'll try it on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'll wait over there for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean? Nii-san has to look at me when I try it on, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have to tell me if they look good on me, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… it's you in underwear, you know? You're fine with being seen by me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind… if Nii-san is the one…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Can you please not say that in a crowded place like this…? The older ladies and employees are all staring at me even more coldy now…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Nii-san has already seen me naked countless times."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Countless times, you say…? That was back when we were still little kids…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We often took baths together back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was back when he felt nothing when he saw his sister's breasts. And since then, Mizuha's breasts had taken quite the form. There's no way he could not be conscious of them now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then wait a bit, okay?" said Mizuha, walking towards the changing stall with the underwear in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, a few minutes later, Mizuha poked out her head through an opening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… sorry for making you wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even through the curtains, Keiki could see her fidgeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried them on… b-but it really is a bit embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right? Should we just leave it at this for the day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No. I want to keep going. I want Nii-san to look at me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is your decision written in stone like this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short pause, the curtains slowly but steadily opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The scenery that appeared before his eyes was too stimulating, and it robbed Keiki of his ability to think. His little sister was currently standing there, wearing only underwear, with a bright red face. Her most important places were only hidden by a grey bra and grey panties. Her soft-looking breasts, her well-formed belly, and her slender back…</p>
<p class="null-p">This… is even worse than I thought it would be…!</p>
<p class="null-p">This was completely different from when he had seen her by accident before. After all, he now knew that she wasn't his bloodrelated little sister. Adding to that was the fact that she was showing him this by choice because of her feelings. Keiki was assaulted with powerful feelings of stimulation and arousal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-How is it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… yeah, it really looks good on you, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does it make you… excited?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It does. Of course it does."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…? I'm glad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you glad about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy that Nii-san is excited because of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuuu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her flustered smile was so bright that Keiki could feel his heart imploding. Today, Mizuha was probably going all-out to try to make her brother fall for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll buy these."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, go ahead…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she changed back into her normal clothes, she tightly grasped the underwear as she walked to the register.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank God. I will finally be freed from…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki lifted up his head after letting out a relieved sigh…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyes met the gaze of a familiar girl, who was busy looking at the underwear lineup. It was the girl with reddish-brown hair bound together in a sidetail: Nanjou Mao. Clearly surprised by their sudden meeting, her hands, which were holding a considerably large bra, froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Nanjou. What a coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean 'coincidence?' This is a lingerie shop, you know? What exactly are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He certainly didn't have the courage to tell her that he was picking out underwear for his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well~ I thought that I might want to get a bra for myself…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In complete silence, Mao took a few steps back from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I didn't think that Keiki would have that kind of hobby…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm very sorry! I lied!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This is bad… If she finds out that I came here to choose underwear from my little sister, I'll die…! Socially!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, thanks for waiting… Oh, Mao-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha's here too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah. Uhm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stared at Mizuha with a helpless expression on his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please, Mizuha! Help me out here…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha realized that and nodded in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just now, Nii-san was picking out some new underwear for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu… You…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mizuha's extremely blunt statement, Mao's eyes looked at Keiki like she was looking at human garbage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, Nii-san said 'I will pick the panties that suit Mizuha the most!', right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never said anything like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the worst…" Mao's gaze burned even more fiercely as she glared at Keiki. "I knew that you were a siscon, but to force your preferences onto your little sister… I've decided. I'll make our classmates call you 'Perverted older brother' from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering Mao's connection network, she would definitely have no problem pulling it off. Just like that, Keiki's nickname changed from 'Siscon older brother' to 'Perverted older brother.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a horrible day…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Normally, the Onii-chan wouldn't be the one who picks out the panties for his little sister," Mizuha said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were the one who forced me to do it, you know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of Mao, the story about the lingerie shop incident had spread, and it had even reached Sayuki and Yuika. Shortly afterwards, he received emails from both of them. Said messages were abusive one-word statements like 'Pervert' or 'Siscon', and they came in like a tsunami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, we didn't clear up the misunderstanding, and the nicknames were already barely stopping at the tame title of 'siscon,' huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's mostly the truth, so what's wrong with that? …Anyway, currently I'm only interested in Nii-san's blueberry crêpe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah yeah, go ahead. Eat as much as you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he handed the crêpe over, she tried a mouthful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mmm, my strawberry crêpe is pretty good, but blueberry isn't half bad either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure the crêpe is happy that you like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, they were in an open park outside. The sky was dyed a strong orange by the setting sun, and they had found a bench to sit down on, each of them enjoying a crêpe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you have some cream on your cheek."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha brought her face closer and licked away the cream on Keiki's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Indeed, Mizuha-san, thou canst be quite bold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What's with that ancient way of speaking?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Anyway, it's gotten pretty dark, so should we go home for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a bit. It'll be soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What will be soon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter. Come here."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was pulled by Mizuha, and they made their way to the front of a water fountain. Immediately after they arrived, their surroundings were wrapped in a dazzling light.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fountain was illuminated with artificial lights. Even Keiki had to say that it looked rather romantic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The girls in my class told me about this. I wanted to see this with Ni-san… What do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that it looks pretty romantic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Since we're here already, how about we take a picture?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, nice idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, Nii-san, come a bit closer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A bit too far. Here, like this." Hey, isn't this a bit…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha tightly gripped Keiki's arm, and her soft feeling was directly transmitted to his skin and relayed towards his brain cells.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were currently standing at a distance that only couples do. Pushing out one hand in front of her, she flipped her smartphone's camera to selfie mode and showed a bright smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no use arguing about it-Here, say cheese!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the shutter played, and Mizuha separated from Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">After checking the screen, she happily smiled.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_11.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Did you take a good one?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's perfect. I'll send it to you later, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, well… I was just thinking that we might really look like a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Yeah, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching a movie together, going shopping together, taking a picture together…</p>
<p class="null-p">-It was exactly like the normal date Keiki had always dreamed of.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe, if it's Mizuha, we might actually become normal lovers….?</p>
<p class="null-p">Once he started thinking that, he furiously shook his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">No no no no… Even if we're not related, Mizuha is still my little sister, you know? Laying my hands on her is…</p>
<p class="null-p">He had repeated those thoughts countless times already inside his head. Still, he was unable to find the right answer. And while her older brother was in lost in his internal conflict, Mizuha showed him a bright, gleeful smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was a lot of fun, but when I think that it's going to be over soon, I feel a bit lonely…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There's one thing that I would like to know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm? What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did Mizuha fall in love with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… I wonder. I don't know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that the trigger was that first meeting with you… You heard about my real parents from Father, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though it's been so long, I can clearly remember the first time I met Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">With the light of the water fountain behind her, the girl started talking about the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was a bit before meeting Nii-san, when I was still in preschool. My parents worked at the same place, so they always went there together in one car, and they always picked me up together in the evening… But one day, no matter how long I waited, they wouldn't come."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I waited so, so long. In the end, my parents never came home. The people who came to pick me up were the father and mother that I have right now. In the end, I was never able to say 'Welcome back' to my real parents ever again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were memories from when she was still a small child.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how tough must that have been?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how lonely and how sad must she have been?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just from imagining that, it felt like someone was ramming a knife into Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I didn't have any relatives I could go to, father and mother adopted me. And in that house, I met Nii-san for the first time-" She stopped, lifted up her head, and gazed at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I remember it, even now. What Nii-san said to me back then. What he said to me, who had just lost the people she loved the most in the entire world. 'From now on, we'll always be together,' you said. Hearing those words, I felt so, so happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her kind, thankful smile showed just how important and how special those words were for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Living under the same roof, eating the same food, watching the same TV show while laughing, fighting over the smallest things, but still, making up immediately-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words, drenched in her warm, comforting feelings, were transmitted to Keiki so directly that it hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if I wouldn't fall in love with you while being so close like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the process of why Kiryuu Mizuha had fallen in love with her older brother. It wasn't anything special at all. Her feelings came about because they were always together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for always staying together with me-I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she spoke out those sweet words of affection, Mizuha brought her face closer. Even though Keiki still thought that they shouldn't do this, he couldn't pull away. He only shut his eyes, and a soft feeling hit his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Just kidding~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened his eyes, he saw Mizuha's finger pressed against his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I promised you that I wouldn't kiss you anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you expect it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Did not!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki's reaction completely blew his cover, the girl let out a giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nii-san is fine with it, let's go another date sometime, okay?" …Just how cute can you be?</p>
<p class="null-p">It shouldn't come as a surprise that the girl's smile did a lot of damage to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">That evening, in the bathroom of the Kiryuu household.</p>
<p class="null-p">While soaking in the warm, water-filled bathtub up to his shoulders, Keiki reminisced about the date today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The date was really fun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were his honest feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching a movie in the manga café, holding hands while walking, feeding each other crêpes. Keiki was sure that they must have looked like a lovey-dovey, happy couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The problem isn't that Mizuha is a bad girl or anything. She's cute, kind, and has big breasts… And she even told me that she liked me."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way that Keiki wouldn't feel happy about this straightforward, impactful confession. It made him think that her being his little sister wasn't a problem at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As long as she's cute, it doesn't matter if she's my little sister, right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he called her his little sister, they weren't related by blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">If they decided that they wanted to get married, there would be no problem at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, thinking about marriage is a bit too fast, isn't it…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling embarrassed by his thoughts, Keiki dived deeper into the bathtub, until even his head was underwater.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't even give her an answer to her confession yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should he accept her feelings or not? The answer wouldn't come to him, no matter how long he thought about it. "I feel a bit dizzy… It's time to get out."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, his answer was postponed once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">After drying himself off, Keiki put on his clothes, dryed his hair, and returned back to his room, only to find Mizuha sleeping on top of his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She doesn't know how hard it is for me, and she's sleeping with such a happy face," Keiki said. He sat down on the end of the bed, softly stroking the girl's face. "Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to her was her smartphone, and on the screen was the photo they had taken together at today's date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now matter how I look at it, we totally look like a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was probably waiting for Keiki to get out of the bath, gazing at this one picture-She probably wanted to look at it with him. Imagining that, Keiki could feel his face getting hotter. Trying to cover that up, he swiped back through the other photos she had taken.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ahaha, when did she even take this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her phone was full of photos of Keiki from today's date.</p>
<p class="null-p">His profile while eating his crepe, his appearance while he was looking at a frying pan with a serious face. Countless pictures, only of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Does she have more?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he felt bad for peeking into her photo folder, his curiosity got the better of him-</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But once he arrived at a certain photo, he couldn't hold back his astonishment. What was shown on the photo was a girl hiding her eyes with one hand. The bottom part of her clothes were in her mouth, and her chest, wrapped in a pink bra, and her beautiful belly were clearly visible. Her other free hand was holding up the smartphone to take a selfie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-What is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The main problem was that Keiki knew the girl in that picture. After all, the clothes she was wearing, that pink underwear, and the clover necklace around her neck exactly matched the appearance</p>
<p class="null-p">'she' had during their date today-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that… Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There's was no way that he would mistake her just because she was hiding her eyes. Her hair, her lips… he clearly recognized her. The girl in the picture was without a doubt Kiryuu Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">This… is something I shouldn't ever see, right…?</p>
<p class="null-p">HIs heart was beating like crazy, when-</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had probably opened her eyes around that time. Mizuha had lifted her body up from the bed and was staring at Keiki in puzzlement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that… mine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing that her older brother was holding her phone, her cute face lost all color-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, stooooop!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a shriek that Keiki had never heard in all the years that they had lived together, she ripped her smartphone out of his hands. And, after checking the screen, she fell back onto the bed, staring blankly at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Did you see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………I saw."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… So I was too late."</p>
<p class="null-p">That picture of Mizuha was already burned into Keiki's mind. "Honestly, I'm a bit confused here… What is this picture about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. I don't upload that stuff online. I would hate to be seen online, after all… Though I would welcome it if I was seen by</p>
<p class="null-p">Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he should know this girl more than anyone else, he had never expected to hear these words. And, with the most lovable flustered smile, she said…</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I'm an exibitionist."</p>
<p class="null-p">And threw this coming-out statement at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, both Mizuha and Keiki were sitting on top of the bed, facing each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It happened in the summer of my 5th year in gradeschool. We had swimming class that day, and I forgot to bring some reserve panties, so I had to walk around the whole day without wearing any. During that time, I felt weirdly excited, and the embarrassment I felt…" "And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It felt really good for some reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What Keiki had asked her was the reason why she became an exibitionist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you found out, I might as well show you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha fiddled with her phone and handed it it Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the smartphone that he had received, he could see an opened folder of pictures. Pictures of her lifting up her skirt, pictures of her only wearing underwear, and even completely naked ones.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… Mizuha-san? Somehow, that room looks oddly familiar though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah that. I took those when I was naked in Nii-san's room while you were sleeping. My heart was beating so fast that I thought I might die."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of strip-show are you doing inside my room?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Here was a perverted girl, taking nudes while her older brother was sleeping almost right next to her. While he was in the land of his dreams, his little sister was in her birthday suit right next to him. Just the thought of that sent shivers down his spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There were also times when I fell asleep inside Nii-san's room like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you were sometimes wrapped up in my blanket?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Dangerous photos kept coming when Keiki swiped through the folder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wanted to ask about this before, but what were those panties for that you left with the love letter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I actually brought them to change into them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Change? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That time when we were cleaning the clubroom, I was actually wearing no panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No panties?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it came out of Cinderella's mouth, it was the cold, hard truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It wasn't because you forgot to put them on, right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It wasn't that. I didn't wear them out of my own free will. Sometimes I want to have this feeling of liberation, so sometimes I go to school without wearing any."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No-panties days, you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, on that day, I was getting sweaty because of the cleaning… so, uhm, I was feeling a bit drippy down there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So when I put down the love letter, I went to put on the extra ones that I brought, but Nii-san came back faster than I had expected. I hid inside the locker in a panic and forgot to take the panties with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">And right after that, Keiki had found the love letter. Until he had calmed down and left, Mizuha had to hide inside the locker. Thinking back on it, Mizuha was uncomfortably fidgeting after the cleaning operation had finished. And the reason for that was probably because she wasn't wearing panties. It was because she was sweating in a place that surely wouldn't be comfortable for a clean freak like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before, there was a time when Nii-san asked me if I ever felt like not wearing panties at all some days, and I said no, but that was a total lie. I don't wear panties on a regular basis."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh dear God…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been terribly shocked when he found out that Tokihara Sayuki hadn't worn panties for the duration of one day, but Mizuha had been doing that regularly all along.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Then, why did you steal those panties back from my room? There was a possibility that I would find out about your identity because of that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really liked those panties. And I felt weird knowing that Nii-san would probably use them for this and that every night." "Just for reference, I never once used them for that, okay?!" He wanted to emphasise that part.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But, I understand that you're an exibitonist, but why did you take all those pictures during the date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Some pictures in that folder he was shown clearly were shot during the date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… I wanted to get attention from Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Attention?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all… Nii-san got excited by Tokihara-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't mean for that to happen, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I get mad, I feel like stripping. Once I start, I can't hold myself back. It's like stress relief to take photos like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of stress relief is that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because her older brother was being flirty with other girls, she had felt irritated, and relieved her stress inside the toilet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, when I go to school without panties, or when I take these pictures, I get really excited. And aroused. Just like when Niisan saw me in my underwear today."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was probably the main reason why she had wanted him to pick out new underwear for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The prince, who had been searching for so long, had now found out that his Cinderella was in fact an exibitionist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though I'm your little sister, I would be happy if you made me your girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, that's impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how cute she was, no matter if they weren't connected by blood, a pervert was impossible for him. After all, Keiki's dream was to experience normal love with a normal girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">All four of the Cinderella candidates who had participated in the cleaning operation. He had found out that all of them were perverts, and the hope that he could get a girlfriend had finally been shattered into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: The surprise attack comes after the fireworks</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">The Obon Festival had ended, and it was morning on a day in the latter half of summer vacation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The weather is really nice today, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked out the window, Keiki couldn't spot a single cloud in the sky. He headed downstairs to the living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nii-san. Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha turned towards him with a smile while she was cooking breakfast in the kitchen. His little sister was making food for him. There couldn't be any greater blessing than that for a siscon like him. Finding himself in a great mood because of that, Keiki took out some milk from the refrigerator and cheerfully watched Mizuha as he took a long sip from it-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bufu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He spat out the milk inside his mouth and started choking. And who could blame him? After all, the girl in front of him was wearing close to nothing. The only thing that was keeping her from being buttnaked was the apron she had on. This was a so-called "naked apron."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait wait wait! What?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly are you wearing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A naked apron."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't give me that 'What's the problem?' face! It makes me look like I'm the weird one!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The weird one was without a doubt Mizuha, not Keiki. Cooking with that appearance was more than unthinkable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why are you wearing a naked apron?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that it would make you happy… Are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you put it that way, then of course I am… But I think that this is something that only newlywed couples should do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine since Nii-san will be my husband in the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the first I've heard of these future plans!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was the Cinderella who dropped her panties, and soon after she revealed that Keiki and her weren't actually blood-related, she stopped hiding her non-familial affection for Keiki. He wracked his brain wondering how to respond to her feelings, but the situation completely changed when he found out that she was an exibitionist. Keiki valued normal relationships above all else, so he decided to keep treating Mizuha like a normal little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, being seen by Nii-san while wearing this bold clothing… somehow… it feels really good," Mizuha started fidgeting and breathing heavily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could only mutter "My little sister can't be this perverted," and wished that he could somehow run away from reality. He couldn't put into words how depressed he was from finding out that his beloved little sister was this much of a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Auuu… But, if you keep staring at me like that, it still feels a bit embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop! Don't just turn your back to me! Your butt! I can fully see your butt right noooooooooow!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Acting all embarrassed, Mizuha turned her back to Keiki, purposefully showing him her well-formed butt. Keiki's resulting scream echoed through the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since he had found out about Mizuha's fetish, Keiki had lost his last safe refuge. Even his own home was no longer free of perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Mizuha changed into some more proper clothes, and they ate breakfast together as usual. Today's breakfast was eggs, bacon, and salad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Geez, what a horrifying way to start the day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Calling your little sister's naked apron 'horrifying' is a bit insensitive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, Mizuha, what would you think if I were to prepare some boiled eggs while wearing only an apron?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… I don't think that I want to see that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? Just imagining it makes my skin scrawl."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki imagined himself giggling and winking at his little sister while wearing that. The thought of it alone was nearly enough for him to lose his appetite.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Nii-san. I will be staying over at Mao-chan's house today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're having a sleepover?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. She wants me to model for her or something like that." "…I have a really bad feeling about this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao-chan, otherwise known as Nanjou Mao, was actually a BL manga artist, whose works often crossed over into the R-18 realm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course he would have reservations about such a person suddenly asking Mizuha to model for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, saying something here about her choice of friends is also a bit much…</p>
<p class="null-p">They really must be close if they're going as far as having a sleepover. Of course, Mizuha and Mao were in the same year and attending the same school, so maybe they had just gotten a bit closer after the cleaning operation and pool trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So with that being said, you'll have to make dinner for yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, don't go inviting other girls over while I'm gone, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As much as I'd like to, I don't have anyone like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Keiki put the last piece of bacon into his mouth and finished his breakfast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the food-Now then, it's time for me to start my preparations."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm? Nii-san, are you going out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, yeah, just for a bit…" Keiki said with distant-looking eyes as he went to wash the dishes. "I have to get revenge against someone." In response, Mizuha only tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">At around 9:50am, Keiki and Sayuki could be seen in a cinema in a neighbouring city.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uhm, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I got really excited when Keiki-kun said that he wanted to go on a date. I even got my hopes up, thinking that you might've decided to become my master. Even so… Even so-Why did you decide on a horror movie?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because it's summer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki made a displeased face after hearing her Kouhai's simple answer. She was sitting in the seat next to Keiki, and she looked terrified even though the horror movie hadn't started yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why are you being so mean to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Punishment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, when we were at the pool with everyone, you gave Nanjou's doujin to Mizuha, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Twitch…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The doujin he was referring to was the boys love manga he himself was, against his will, a model for. Now that Mizuha had gotten a taste of this wicked world, Keiki was worried that she would become forever tainted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha thought that I was gay because of Senpai, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that's why we're here for this horror movie?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. I thought long and hard about how to punish you without you actually enjoying it. And then I remembered that you weren't good with ghost stories and such."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was there ever any indication that I wasn't good with horror?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you tried your hardest to change the topic back then. So then, I decided to have you watch this movie all the way through. The reviews online said that it was really well-made, and even veterans of the genre were scared out of their wits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Can I go home now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope."</p>
<p class="null-p">When her smiling Kouhai denied her only escape, Sayuki's facial expression turned into one of despair. And then the curtains opened, signaling the beginning of the movie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's about to start, it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't wanna! Let me gooo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please keep it down. You'll bother the other people here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A demon! You're a demon, aren't you?! But Keiki-kun being a hardcore sadist isn't so bad either!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring her desperate cries for help, the lights in the room dimmed. Advertisements for new movies started rolling, and shortly after, the horror movie began.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was set in Japan, and the story was about the ghost of a little girl who had disappeared in the past. She was now plaguing a female teacher at a grade school. The main appeal of this movie was the constant fear that something might jump out at you any moment. Though it was a horror movie, the script was very well-written, and the tension was high throughout the whole movie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, this is pretty good…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the normally-brave Keiki jumped in fright once or twice. The person next to him kept screaming at every chance, clinging to her Kouhai with tears in her eyes. Of course, that caused her well-formed chest to be pressed against his arm on a constant basis.</p>
<p class="null-p">God, this might be the first time I'm enjoying watching a horror movie this much.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lucky boy sent a prayer of thanks towards the gods above who had granted him these wonderful moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the movie ended, Keiki and Sayuki went to a cafe nearby. They were sitting in a window booth, and Sayuki gazed at Keiki with a face as white as chalk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was terrifying… I won't even be able to go to the toilet alone tonight…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha ha ha, that's what you get."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cruel?! …But, I'm also a bit happy to be bullied like this by Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really jealous of how easy it is for a hardcore masochist to enjoy themselves. But now that I've gotten my revenge, I feel incredibly refreshed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun really has some great sadistic traits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not happy to hear that at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he felt a small bit of joy from troubling her like this, Kiryuu Keiki was completely normal. He loved big breasts, and also greatly appreciated small breasts. See? Normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I will apologize for giving Nanjou-san's doujin to Mizuha-san. I just wanted to share it with more people, since it's such a wonderful piece of art."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If said piece of art doesn't have anything to do with me in any way, shape, or form, do as you please… Ahh, speaking of Nanjou, Mizuha said that she was staying over at her house tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Staying over…? Wait, ahhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I remembered something very troublesome…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Troublesome?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki nodded in response. "Today, nobody is home. My parents left for two days for their wedding anniversary this morning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, so Senpai is also all alone today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it wasn't anything all that bad, Sayuki's facial colour changed to a pure white.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't stay alone tonight after seeing that movie! I won't even be able to go to the toilet alone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you a kid or something…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I beg you! Please let me stay at your house today!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying? That's out of the question even normally. And today, Mizuha isn't home either. A girl staying over at a boy's home all alone would be pretty bad, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki camly refused, Sayuki started muttering with tears in her eyes. "…Keiki-kun forcefully brought me here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really scared, you know. Even though I told you I didn't want to watch it, you called it 'punishment' or whatever. You wouldn't forgive me even after I started crying…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a shaky voice, she looked at her Kouhai with watery eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better take responsibility…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Senpai?! Phrasing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those easy-to-misunderstand words she let out garnered attention from the other customers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did he force her into a hotel?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Poor girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">-and so on. The female customers mainly were the ones reacting. Even the female employees looked at him with cold eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun… Take responsibility, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gaaaaaaaaah! I get it! I get it already, so stop!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that, it was decided that Sayuki would be staying over at his house that night.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the evening of that day. After going to her house and getting some things, Sayuki made her way to Kiryuu's home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will be in your care today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I can't offer you much, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He greeted her at the door and showed her to the living room, where she sat down on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, have some barely tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking a sip of the cooled tea, both of them let out a relieved sigh. Whenever his eyes met hers, she showed him an awkward smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a bit nervous. This is the first time I've stayed over at someone else's house."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't really have the time to play with friends when I was younger, and everyone just thought that I was a sheltered daughter or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh now that you mention it, your home is quite magnificent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's an old house. And right now we're working to renovate the interior. I'll have to show you around sometime."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'd love that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When that time comes, I will introduce you as 'my future master' to my parents."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When that time comes, I will deny it completely."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though there was a bit of tension, their conversation was the same as usual. Maybe she was able to relax because of that. Sayuki's expression relaxed as she calmly got up from the couch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You haven't eaten dinner yet, right? Since Mizuha-san isn't here today, I'll make you something as thanks for letting me stay over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Senpai can cook?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I can make fried eggs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence. So can I."</p>
<p class="null-p">With head held high, Sayuki arrogantly trotted towards the kitchen. However…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah? Their form is collapsing… Whatever, the taste is what counts."</p>
<p class="null-p">With anxiety in her voice, she continued to cook, and…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, fried eggs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, these are definitely scrambled eggs…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The eggs that the girl put in front of Keiki were more scrambled than fried.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They lost their form when I was in the middle of making them, so I mashed them together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's how scrambled eggs are made, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he had expected fried eggs, the scrambled eggs didn't taste half bad, and he was satisfied with that night's dinner. Being a bit entranced by the sight of Sayuki cooking was also a big part of it, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">After dinner, it would normally be time to take a bath. Since Sayuki told him to go first, Keiki obliged. After drying off his body and hair, Keiki returned the living room, feeling refreshed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, the bath is open now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun… There's a big problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Taking a bath alone is too scary…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please Keiki-kun, will you take a bath with me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course not."</p>
<p class="null-p">They weren't kids anymore. Taking a bath together with a girl with that nice of a body would be bad in a lot of ways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, but, the movie we watched today had a bath scene, right?! As if I could take a bath alone after watching that! Anybody would be scared!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why don't you just not take a bath today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm an adolescent girl, you know. There's no way I could skip taking a bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just hurry up and take one already."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, it was decided that she would take a (waterproof) smartphone with her, and put it on speakerphone, with Keiki listening from the other side. Because of that, he could hear the sounds of the water, and the girl's pleasant sighs, so it was no surprise that Keiki had a hard time holding back his indecent fantasies.</p>
<p class="null-p">>Hey, Keiki-kun? Right now, your Senpai is thoroughly washing her breasts, you know?<</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you keep toying with me like that, I'll hang up."</p>
<p class="null-p">>I apologize! Please don't!<</p>
<p class="null-p">They laughed about what they were doing right now, and kept talking about whatever came to mind. Keiki had a lot of fun the whole time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for waiting. The bath felt really pleasant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I'm glad to hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since my hair is so long, I have a hard time actually drying it."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she returned to the living room, Sayuki was wearing a t-shirt and shorts, and seeing her still-damp hair made Keiki's heart beat faster for some reason. Why do girls look so appealing right after coming out of the bath?</p>
<p class="null-p">Noticing that her Kouhai had suddenly gotten quiet, Sayuki looked at him in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. It's nothing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't exactly say that he was entranced by her appearance, so he tried to change the subject.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We still have some time left until bedtime. How about we play a game?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds good. I don't plan on losing, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki jumped on board with that idea, and they played games until late at night.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, the girl was very bad at every game they played.</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, Sayuki adamantly refused to sleep in the guest room, so Keiki had no other choice but to let her sleep in his room. He brought out a futon reserved for guests and a towel blanket. It always get hotter during the night, so this should be enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll turn off the lights."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having done so, Keiki returned to his bed, and Sayuki snuggled up next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, why are you coming in here? Your bed is over there, Senpai. Why are you acting like we're going to be sleeping together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch, just when I thought of being a bit lovey-dovey with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">While puffing out her cheeks, the girl unwillingly returned to her own futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Keiki-kun is unable to hold back, you can assault me any time you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That response was fast. Isn't it a bit rude of you to not do anything when there's a beauty like me in the same room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she complained for a bit, she soon grew more docile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It really is soothing, having someone next to you like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are like a kid today, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because Keiki-kun forced me to watch that scary movie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason for that was because you showed Mizuha that BL manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm having fun right now, so it's fine. I never thought I would stay over at a male kouhai's house like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I think about it, couldn't you have just asked Yuika-chan if you could stay over at her house?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't ask that girl, can I? She would make fun of me for the rest of my life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, yeah you're right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If the hardcore sadist Yuika knew of this weakness, he would surely exploit it to the best of her ability. The gap between her looks and her personality really was tremendously wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, have you finished your summer homework?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm on the final stretch. What about Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've gotten most of it done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, just what I would expect."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But my work for fine arts is still left. They said that I could write whatever I wanted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about you just write whatever you want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the problem. I'm having problems with what to write. 'Pig 4 Life' or 'Verbal abuse is a reward' is what I've thought of so far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you really handed that in, you would be called to the student guidance office in a matter of minutes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And then, the fine arts teacher would lose his reasoning after seeing a beauty like me, and play with my body inside the student guidance office."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what is going on inside of Senpai's head…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is her head filled with anything other than punishment…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way Keiki-kun, did something happen recently?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels like you're out of it today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you weren't looking at my chest at all today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of criterion is that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki couldn't exactly deny her observation.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Is it really that obvious that I'm feeling down?</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew the reason. The Cinderella incident was still plaguing his thoughts. Even though he had finally managed to figure out the identity of Cinderella, he still wasn't able to get his first girlfriend. "If you want, you can ask this Onee-san here for advice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not all that important. A lot has happened recently, and it feels like I've lost the goal in front of my eyes. It's like I'm burnt out or something. That's why I might've seemed a bit down."</p>
<p class="null-p">While lying on his bed facing the ceiling, he started talking about the weird, uncomfortable feeling inside of his chest. It wasn't even worth calling a worry. Even so, Sayuki listened to him, without teasing him in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. Even I don't fully understand it myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's fine. Everyone has times like these."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It must be similar to when I give it my all for a contest, and still don't win."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I guess you can compare it to that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if you stop right then and there, it's all over. You said that you'd lost the goal in front of you, right? If so, then you just have find it again. Go at your own pace, but don't ever stop."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he's lost his current objective, he just has to find a new one. Though he hadn't managed to get a lover this time, he just had to try something else. Forget about finding Cinderella, and get a cute girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might sound arrogant coming from me, huh? I guess I have to give it my all too-To have Keiki-kun look at me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? D-Does that mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki panicked when the girl suddenly let out a surprise attack like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, though she didn't turn out to be his Cinderella, the chance that she still held affection for Keiki wasn't exactly zero. After all, she had accepted the invite to the date today, and she doesn't seem to have any problems sleeping in the same room as him. Would a girl really act like that towards a boy she had absolutely no romantic feelings for?</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe, just maybe… Might this be my one chance?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Like this, the virgin boy's expectations shot through the roof in mere seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"One day, I will have Keiki become my master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reality really is cruel. The dream of this cute Senpai, namely becoming Keiki's pet, didn't at all match the normal love that the poor boy wished for.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a result, there was no sweet development this time around either.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next morning, Keiki suddenly woke up from a fitful sleep. He immediately found out that the cause was Sayuki, who had snuggled into his bed and was clinging to him in her sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why did I even bother bringing out the other futon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What a normie situation. Waking up to a beautiful girl like her hugging him. For a boy of his age, this couldn't be called anything less than a dream come true. Sayuki, however, wasn't a normal girl, but rather a masochist and a female molester.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is everything normal? Or did I get deflowered during the night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While checking for the safety of his son, Keiki heard an "I'm back~" from downstairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it seems like Mizuha is home-Wait, isn't this situation pretty bad?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His black-haired Senpai was still hugging him from above. If Mizuha were to see him like this, he wouldn't be able to talk his way out of it. She would surely misunderstand.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was currently lying in the same bed as a girl, in his own room, so would his little sister really believe him if he said "We didn't do anything!"? No, of course she wouldn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, please wake up! Mizuha is home, so please hide-"</p>
<p class="null-p">His words were interrupted by the sound of Mizuha knocking on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, are you awake?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not awake at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? You're totally awake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I an idiot or something?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san? I'm going to come in, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No?! Wait, right now I'm-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Contrary to his pleas, the door slowly started to open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There were some unfamiliar shoes in the entrance, so I was wondering if someone was over-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the door fully opened and she could see into the room, Mizuha froze. On the bed, her older brother was in the middle of pushing himself up, while a sleeping beauty tightly clung to him. In response, every emotion vanished from his little sister's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong! Please, believe me. Nii-san didn't do anything, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nnn… Keiki-kuuun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With the worst timing possible, the sleeping beauty let out this sweet-sounding sleep talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you idioooooooooot!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's scream filled with rage echoed through the house. And on that day, the girl didn't exchange a single word with him until evening.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a few days after Sayuki had stayed over, in late August. Keiki was sitting at his desk, working on his summer homework, when his smartphone suddenly vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nnn? I wonder who it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he went to check, he found a new email from Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Hello. Do you have time tomorrow? Can you go to the summer festival with Yuika?'</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an invitation for a festival that was held regularly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A festival, huh? I'll be done with my homework soon, and I don't have any plans for tomorrow anyway…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His search for Cinderella had ended as well, so Keiki, still girlfriendless, had all the time in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking that into consideration, he typed 'OK' in response and put his smartphone back on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">-In that exact moment, it vibrated again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? This time it's from Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like Yuika's message, it was an invitation for the upcoming festival.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Let's go to the summer festival together.' it said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… Well, we can just go as a group, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">Again he replied with an 'OK.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Not much later, Mao also invited him-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, going as a group wouldn't hurt anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without thinking too much about it, he gave a short 'OK' as a reply. And just when he was about to focus on the rest of his homework, he heard the sound of someone knocking on his door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, do you have a moment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha entered the room, seeming a bit nervous. "It's about tomorrow's festival. Do you want to go together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah sure. I already have plans to go with the other club members, so we can all walk around the festival together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Throwing her insensitive older brother a cold stare, Mizuha could only sigh in resignation.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the following day, in the evening. In front of a shinto shrine, the club members were gathering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oohhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">All these beauties wearing yukatas; what a sight to behold. With her long, black hair in a ponytail, the Senpai looked even more erotic than usual. The blonde-haired kouhai had her hair up, making her look even more cute than her normal appearance. His classmate, with her reddish-brown hair in braids, made Keiki's heart beat faster. And to finish it off, his little sister, with her hair in a short ponytail, was so cute that he thought for a second he might ascend into heaven. However, since they had worked their hardest to style themselves up, the girls weren't as impressed as the airheaded Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I thought that it would probably turn out like this…" "Yuika is disappointed in Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's even more frustrating knowing that he doesn't do it on purpose…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you idiot…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every member of the calligraphy club, as well as Mizuha, voiced their displeasure. Not to mention that the 'Idiot' from Mizuha hurt even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… You all look really good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">The responses he received for praising their appearances weren't exactly what he had expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-Well, since we're here now, let's walk around the festival together."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki tried to fix the foul atmosphere, the other girls followed him, although they still didn't seem to be totally satisfied. However, that soon changed when they arrived at the different stalls.</p>
<p class="null-p">After treating Mao to some yakitori, putting on a hyottoko mask to make Yuika laugh, having a fishing competition with Mizuha, and eating a candied apple with Sayuki, the five of them thoroughly enjoyed their time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Walking through the rows of stalls, Keiki called out to Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I haven't been able to catch up with you for a while. How have you been doing? Has anything cool happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was mostly in my own room, working on my manuscript. What about you, Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika was mostly reading books at home. Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me? Let's see… I went on a date with Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to her Witch-senpai's words, Yuika's expression completely froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly do you mean by that, Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly what I said. We watched a movie together, talked in a nearby cafe, and slept in the same bed that evening."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Slept in the same bed?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The last part clearly succeeded in provoking Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san really brought Tokihara-senpai home when I wasn't there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that his beloved little sister's words only poured gasoline into the fire.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-senpai? What exactly is the meaning of this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, what should we eat next~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to ignore Yuika's question, he looked around the nearby food stalls. There he spotted the face of a familiar girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Koharu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun. So you came with everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu, who was also wearing a yukata, smiled at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai, you're working at this stall?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our company owns this stall, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so you're helping out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm here too, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, if it isn't Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">While carrying a small box in his arms, the ikemen showed his face. Just like Keiki, he was wearing normal clothes instead of a yukata.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Seeing Ootori-san work like this really makes me worried about child labour laws."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that? Though it might not look like it, I am indeed a highschool student."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu puffed out her cheeks in response to Sayuki's teasing. While she was doing so, a young couple arrived at the stand. In response, Koharu smiled at them, handed over the goods and received the money in return. Shortly after, countless other customers arrived, and she treated them just as before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks like things are pretty busy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Actually, the person responsible for this stand suddenly became ill, and we were one person shorthanded. Thankfully,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma-kun offered to help out so we're barely scraping by-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa, Koharu-chan! We're almost out of cabbage!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! We can't make okonomiyaki without that! Shouma-kun, can you go and buy some right now?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's for Koharu-chan, I would travel to the end of the world and back to get some cabbage!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The one from a nearby supermarket is perfectly fine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thankfully, Shouma was rather fast-footed, thanks to him being a full-fledged member of the tennis club. After watching him disappear in the distance, Koharu directed a troubled gaze at Keiki and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… I know that I'm being selfish here, but would you be so kind as to help out until Shouma-kun comes back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With all the customers lining up at the stall, it was no surprise that Koharu would have trouble manning it alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. If you're fine with me, then I will gladly help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Though the taste of the okonomiyaki might not be as good as a result."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki said it half-jokingly, Koharu didn't seem to take it all too well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, I'm really sorry, but can I request someone who has at least a modicum of cooking skill?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they heard these words, the gazes of everyone in the group all fell on a single girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having gathered that much attention, that single girl blinked in disbelief. Of course, the person in question was Keiki's little sister and the head cook of the Kiryuu household: Kiryuu Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it should be fine if we leave it to Mizuha. Sayuki-senpai is the type of person who accidentally makes scrambled eggs out of fried eggs, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry I'm incompetent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even Yuika can make scrambled eggs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you trying to start a fight with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Sayuki and Yuika went back to their usual banter, Koharu directed her attention to Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san, I beg you! You'll get paid, of course!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, can't you help out Koharu-senpai here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmm… Okay. We have to help each other out in times of trouble, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rolling up her sleeves, Mizuha entered the interior and started making okonomiyaki with Koharu. With those two cuties working the stall, the popularity of the stall would surely increase.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Lucky. It'll be easier to separate from everyone this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Did you just say something, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing at all. Nothing-at-all~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki showed no intention of answering her Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Today, I have to be alone with Keiki-kun whatever it takes," she whispered in a voice quiet enough for nobody else to hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Say, Nanjou, you really are talented."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Something like this is pretty easy."</p>
<p class="null-p">After they left Mizuha behind, Mao was currently trying to get some prizes at a shooting range.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had completely obliterated veterans at the game center, and was also good at these analog games. Not to mention that she was very talented at drawing and showed proficient swimming skills back at the pool. She might have even higher specs than Keiki ever expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Some of these are put up so that you can never get them. You have to aim for the ones that are possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you, some kind of pro?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something you want? I can get it for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, then Yuika wants that. That cheeky-looking frog."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay~ …Here we go."</p>
<p class="null-p">The cork Mao shot perfectly hit the stuffed toy, making it roll down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waaah! Thank you very much. Yuika will call him Gungnir." "What a strange name for a frog," Sayuki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it fine? Yuika won't let Witch-senpai pat him anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really care."</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the shooting range behind, the four of them headed towards the seating area of the festival. Luckily, they found an open table. Mao let out a satisfied laugh as she sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, this feels great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou, you seem to be in a good mood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been a shut-in for a while because of my manuscript. It feels good to go outside for a change of pace. Ah, right. Kiryuu! Go buy some takoyaki, and get us some drinks while you're at it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since when did I turn into your errand boy? …Well, I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. Then get me some juice, with carbonated water."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Yuika will go with you. It would be quite troublesome to carry that all alone, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks. What do you want to drink, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me see… I'll take some orange juice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. We'll be back soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu fu fu, Yuika will get Witch-senpai some black coffee," Yuika said with a devilish laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki watched the back of her kouhai with a grin as he left to buy the requested food and drinks with the cute, angel-like girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This is a chance. And I'm the kind of girl who never lets chances go to waste," she said, seeming motivated.</p>
<p class="null-p">And said girl who wouldn't let a chance go to waste approached Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nanjou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? What's wrong, President?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I have some very interesting information."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Interesting information?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see… just now, I saw some young men going into the bushes over there, and they looked rather… close to one another, if you know what I mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mao heard Sayuki's words, her eyes lit up instantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Men are fighting over there like beasts, completely naked? In the night of the festival?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I didn't say anything of that sort…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I cannot leave this as it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">For a BL mangaka like her, this information was something she couldn't ignore; a true gold mine. Seeming prepared for a situation like this, she took out her smartphone, opened the camera app, and stood up with an expression like she was heading to war. In that moment, Keiki and Sayuki returned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Nanjou, where are you going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I just remembered that there's some urgent business I need to take care of."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urgent business…? And what about the takoyaki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just eat it yourself, Kiryuu… Fufufufu, just you wait for me, you young, sturdy-bodied men over there! I will definitely use this sight for source material!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, Mao, who prioritized her doujins above everything else, disappeared into the bushes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Keiki and Yuika looked at one another in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">And behind them, Sayuki let out a silent giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fufufufu, just as planned. You can go ahead and search for those boys who don't even exist in the first place. That's one hindrance gone…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those ominous-sounding words weren't heard by Keiki and Sayuki, and nobody grew wary of what Sayuki was planning.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mao ran off to do her own thing, now the members of the group were only Keiki, Sayuki, and Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san, you're clinging to Keiki-kun a bit too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh, isn't it fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With two beautiful yukata-wearing girls clinging to his arms, it was only natural for Keiki to gather a lot of attention. It was embarrassing enough already, but the envious gazes of the male crowd were starting to hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about we have a competition, with Keiki-kun on the line? The winner can walk around with Keiki on the festival."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds interesting. Very well, Yuika will accept the challenge!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As always, my opinion doesn't count I see…" Keiki muttered</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was made the prize, and the competition was decided to be katanuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">(TLC: Japanese festival activity in which a colored mold of candy made of wheat flour, starch, or sugar is carved using a needle or toothpick into the shape of an animal, star, a cherry blossom (桜) etc. Those who are able to skillfully carve the mold receive a prize.)</p>
<p class="null-p">"Old man, give me two of the most difficult designs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaa… Isn't that a tulip?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The margin of error for a tulip was nothing more than 3 millimeters.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried doing this as a kid, but I always failed midway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Don't worry about that, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right, Keiki-senpai. Yuika will show you her skilled work with the needle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if you two are fine with it, then that's all that matters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The judge will be the old man. With as strict of a judgement as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what Yuika was hoping for!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, Keiki-kun, signal us to start if you would."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Sayuki and Yuika took their positions after sitting down a table next to the stall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… Start!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, the two of them started carving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though Yuika feels sorry for Witch-senpai, she will be serious here! First, the surrounding area…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm, this stalk here really is a problem…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If you weren't at least a bit proficient at it, a tulip right at the start would be a very difficult thing to carve, indeed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, if I just slowly work in it, then definitely…"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yuika had the necessary confidence. After all, she was very skilled at this kind of fine work. If left alone, she had high enough concentration to read books to no end, and she had even sewed a butler outfit in a single evening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha! Aren't you going to reach your limit soon? Now prepare yourself-! Yuika will pull out every skill she has!" With the smile of an angel, she continued her work. "This competition-Yuika will win it!"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_12.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, Yuika had perfectly finished her work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu! How do you like this workmanship?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika didn't doubt for a moment that she would come out victorious. However- "…Wait, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuika returned back to reality, nobody was there. Even though Sayuki should be facing her and working on her own carving, she was nowhere to be found. Neither was the grand prize, Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai you cheaaaaaater!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika let out a frustrated scream after being deceived by the largebreasted Witch-senpai.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the engrossed Yuika behind, Sayuki and Keiki left the stall behind them and headed behind the shrine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, don't you feel a bit bad for doing that to Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I lost to Koga-san at the pool too. And also, aren't you just as guilty for coming with me, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said you would tell Mizuha that I was grabbing your butt if I didn't follow you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it's the true that something like that happened, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So where are we heading anyway?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can look forward to it until we arrive."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was only given a cute wink in response, and Keiki had no choice but to follow the girl. When they stepped out of the thicket, he found himself on top of a hill. The only things in their field of view were the starry sky and the city below them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, so there was a place like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">She pointed to an even higher place. After walking up a slope for a bit, there was a rock ledge where they could sit down. They did so, and the girl next to Keiki let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like we made it in time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll see soon enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">After giving him that short reply, the girl looked up at the night sky. When Keiki followed suit, the darkness in the sky vanished, and was replaced by the bright light of fireworks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A flower bloomed in the sky, and a loud boom followed shortly after. Countless other fireworks were shot into the sky from the riverbed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It is."</p>
<p class="null-p">Every year, a firework display like this would take place. And right now, both of them could enjoy the fireworks with the best possible view, without being bothered by anyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Summer vacation was really fun, wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really was. It feels like this was the most packed summer vacation I've ever had."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I'm glad that I created so many memories with Keiki-kun. We watched a scary movie together, we played games together, and we intensely showed our love to each other while sharing the same bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That last thing didn't happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, a lot had happened to Keiki. He had gone on a research date with Mao, was able to appreciate Yuika in a maid uniform, and had even gone to the pool together with everyone. And he finally found out the identity of the Cinderella who dropped her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'm glad that I got to watch the fireworks of my last summer vacation together with Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see. This is your last summer vacation."</p>
<p class="null-p">For Keiki, it was normal for her to be by his side, but since they were one year apart, she would graduate one year earlier than Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My mother told me about this place, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When my mother was still a student, my father apparently proposed to her on this very spot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Ohh, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though my father kept it a secret beforehand. On the night of the summer festival, he proposed right here. It's a bit cheesy, but don't you think that it's also pretty romantic?" Saying this, she put her hand on top of Keiki's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning to look at her, he saw that the girl's eyes were looking straight back at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun? Should we-kiss?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words, combined with her soft, inviting voice, made his heart beat faster. Her expression clearly indicated that she wasn't joking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, I seem to be more of a jealous type than I'd thought. Seeing the boy I'm interested in with all these beautiful girls around him makes me nervous, you see. I want to do everything I can so that you only look at me. In order to achieve that-Don't you think that something like this is necessary?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki… senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why this is one of the ways-"</p>
<p class="null-p">With those words, she leaned forward. On this hill, illuminated by the ongoing fireworks, her lips were slowly but steady coming closer to his-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh?! This is where you were!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A cute sounding voice ruined the romantic mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, leaving Yuika all alone like that! How cruel of you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey President, I could never find those men in the bushes you were talking about!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, I finished helping out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with the angry outcry of Yuika, Mao and Mizuha also came walking towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you managed to find a nice way to interrupt us."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki separated herself from with a bittersweet smile and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, let's leave it at that for now. I did manage to watch the fireworks with you after all. We'll continue where we left off some other time-right?" Sayuki gently smiled at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't help but feel embarrassed that such a normal smile like that made his heart beat as fast as it did.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…How often does this girl have to lead me astray like this before she's satisfied…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Knowing her, Sayuki would have probably followed up with a "I kissed you, so you're basically my owner now, right?", and reminded Keiki just how much of a pervert she was, which would leave him as disappointed as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wow, that sounds so plausible that I'm getting scared just thinking about it…</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was lost in thought, Yuika suddenly peered into his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing, Keiki-senpai? The festival is still far from over, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm gonna have you treat me to something good after leaving us alone like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, you cheater."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cheater?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hurried along by the other girls, Keiki and Sayuki followed after them. While walking down the slope of the hill, Sayuki suddenly tripped, falling forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to that short shriek, Keiki turned around, and found Sayuki's face falling towards his own. In the next moment, like a cliche movie scene, their lips overlapped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The contact was only for a single moment. Along with that soft feeling, he could feel the blood rushing to his head. Though Sayuki wasn't necessarily hurt, it was a big incident on a different level. After they separated from each other, Sayuki softly pressed one finger onto her lip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki… senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he called her name, her face went bright red, and she turned her back to him. It was an unexpectedly girly reaction, which left Keiki speechless. Even though she was the one who had asked "Should we kiss?", a surprise attack like that seemed to be too much for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what are you two doing over there?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A kiss?! Did they just kiss?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was an accident! That just now was an unfortunate accident!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the sounds of the girls who watched the scene were even louder than the still ongoing fireworks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was clearly still in a foul mood as they walked home from the shrine. Her stiff expression and violent pace made it obvious how she was feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh… Um, are you still mad about before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was an accident after all. Nobody was at fault. And also, it's Niisan's own decision who he kisses."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so she said, but she was talking quickly enough to clearly indicate that she was very well bothered by it. With this awkward atmosphere, both of them were walking towards their home. But since Mizuha was wearing Japanese wooden clogs, it was taking them a bit longer than normal, since she wasn't used to them. Though they had seen several people wearing yukatas close to the shrine, the number diminished now that they were getting farther away from the festival.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, do you like Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprised by that sudden question, Keiki stopped in his tracks. So did Mizuha. She gazed intently at Keiki, like she was trying to read something from his expression. "Do you like Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What makes you think that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san likes big breasts, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not scummy enough to rank girls based on breast size."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? You're constantly glancing at her chest, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Totally," She replied instantly. "And also, Nii-san seems like he prefers older girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you basing that on…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woman's intuition."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow that sounds oddly convincing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? How do you feel about Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you ask me… I mean, Sayuki-senpai is beautiful, has big breasts, and I can't deny that she's right in my strike zone… But that girl is a hardcore masochist, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ohhh, is that so? So she's right in your strike zone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Did you even listen to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard everything perfectly! I don't want to hear anymore! Nii-san, you idiot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha turned around on her heel and started picking up the pace. Keiki was about to chase after her, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She suddenly let out a shriek and sank to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?! What's wrong?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, the geta strap…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki hurried towards her, he saw that the strap on her wooden clogs was ripped. Probably because she had suddenly tried to run like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it looks like you can't walk home in this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's fine. I'll just walk home barefooted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you an idiot? …Come on, I'll carry you on my back, okay?" Keiki said and turned his back to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Mizuha hesitated for a bit, but finally…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Then, please do."</p>
<p class="null-p">She gave in, and put her arms around his neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm not too heavy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not heavy. I told you this before. You're actually a bit too light."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then that's fine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And this soft sensation hitting my back isn't half-bad, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, Keiki started walking home, carrying Mizuha on his back. There was a short while where neither of them said anything, but Mizuha finally broke the silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something as trivial as this is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not about that. Getting angry like that. Being jealous like that. I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's fine. It's no big deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Don't you think that I'm a bothersome girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm actually a bit happy to be the object of jealousy of a cute girl like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I think that Nii-san is a bit too simple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Men are simple beings."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he answered with that, Keiki heard a small giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today, I talked a lot with Ootori-senpai while helping out with the okonomiyaki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With Koharu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She even told me the story about how Nii-san was acting as her love cupid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was on the search for his Cinderella, he was blackmailed into helping Koharu meet her own crush. At first Keiki thought that it was impossible, since the person Koharu had feelings for was a helpless lolicon, but after setting things up, and even going on a double date, he realized that the two of them had a good chance of hitting it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai is really thankful to you, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hearing that makes me a bit happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And she told me about how Nii-san was searching for Cinderella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Keiki didn't expect that, he subconsciously stopped walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both Ootori-senpai and Shouma-kun helped you with your search. Ahh, that reminds me, she told me to relay her words. 'Sorry for telling your little sister about it,' she said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's totally fine. So what did Senpai tell you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About the fact that Nii-san was trying so hard in his search for</p>
<p class="null-p">Cinderella. When I heard about that, I was really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also about how you wanted to get a girlfriend so badly because you wanted someone to be lovey-dovey with."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well… I'm sorry for being such a lustful Onii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not really mad, you know? I know why Nii-san has been working so hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's only because I wanted a girlfriend, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not just that. You wouldn't normally search for the sender of a possible prank love letter so desperately, you know? I'm sure that the prince in this story was unable to disregard all the feelings packed into the love letter, and worked his hardest so that he could give Cinderella a proper answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wonder. I think that the prince just wanted a cute girlfriend and nothing more, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, are you getting flustered?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Am not."</p>
<p class="null-p">He really couldn't win against Mizuha. Of course, this result was to be expected since they had lived together for such a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Kiss"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she called out his name, he slightly turned his cheek towards Mizuha, and she used this opportunity to kiss Keiki on the cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he froze in disbelief, Mizuha softly rubbed her cheek against his shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You forbid me from mouth-to-mouth kissing, but on the cheek should be safe, right? With this, I can forgive you that you kissed Tokihara-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If you do things like that, I might actually fall in love with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's exactly what I'm hoping for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to hide his embarrassment, he once more started walking. All the while hoping that the girl on his back wouldn't realize how fast his heart was beating.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">Summer vacation had ended, and a new school term had begun. The students had changed into their summer uniforms. After school, Keiki and Sayuki were together in the clubroom. While the Senpai was sitting on the tatami floor conducting club activities, the Kouhai was sitting in a chair reading a book. The only thing that passed between them was an awkward silence. The only thing that Sayuki was writing on her long paper were the words "Inner Tranquility" over and over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uhm, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yesh?! …W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That time at the festival… I'm really sorry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he didn't mention the word 'kiss', the girl immediately understood what he was referring to, and her cheeks started to flush.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-About that… I'm fine… I don't mind it at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to apologize. I was the one who tripped. And, I didn't… exactly… hate it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of those few words, Keiki unwillingly started to get his hopes up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Sayuki-senpai, what do you mean by-"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he made up his mind to ask her about it, a knocking sound came from the door. When Sayuki gave a short "Come in" in reply, Mizuha entered the room, holding her bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, I just thought that I would join the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Join the calligraphy club? Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki could only look at her in bewilderment, Mizuha made her way towards Sayuki, holding out a piece of paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-senpai, the registration form."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me have a look at it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Accepting the form, Sayuki thoroughly inspected it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no problems as far as I can see… But just accepting it outright would be boring, so how about we do a little test?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A test?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is she planning this time…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I hope that she's not going to make her wear a bunny girl outfi- Wait, I actually want to see that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was an exibitionist, she was still quite the beauty to behold. There was no mistake that Keiki would be excited to see her in a bunny girl outfit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… But I don't have the necessary materials to do it today. Then let's do a brief interview. Please take a seat over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha obediently sat down to face Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then first: What is your motivation to join this club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really have any."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Special skills?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everything related to housework. I really love cleaning, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wonderful. We'll leave everything related to that to Mizuha-san from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's only because Sayuki-senpai can't be bothered to do the cleaning herself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only in times like these was it easy to see her real intentions.</p>
<p class="null-p">But with that, it was decided that Mizuha would join the club. After picking up her bag once more, she walked over to Keiki's side, who was still sitting in his chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, I'm looking forward to being with you, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm looking forward to… Wait, Mizuha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Keiki let out a scream like that was because Mizuha slightly lifted up her skirt, just enough to show him the 'Cinderella's panties' she was wearing. And, bringing her lips to her older brother's ears-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-The reason I joined the club is to make sure that you won't be taken by any of the other girls, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She whispered this phrase, which sounded like a declaration of war.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Ayano-san won't give up</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">…How did it come to this?</p>
<p class="null-p">The location was a dark, narrow, isolated hidden room. The only ray of light was filtering through a small window up near the ceiling. And, while Keiki was sitting on the ground, a girl, with one eye hidden by her bangs, was pressing her well-formed chest against him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… Haaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was letting out rough, erotic breaths, and the situation was about to reach its climax. So was Keiki's rational thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"F-Fujimoto-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun's… has gotten a bit hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly might you be talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she blurted out something as wild as that, Keiki immediately shot down the concept.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Really, how did it come to this…?</p>
<p class="null-p">While his head started going blank, he reminisced about how he had gotten into this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">It had been a few days since the new school term started, and it was now a day after classes had ended. Every member of the calligraphy club had gathered in the clubroom, and they were spending the time doing whatever they wanted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was working on her calligraphy, Yuika was creating a picture book, and Mao was working on her manga manuscript. The new member, Mizuha, was studying various cooking books and jotting down recipes, and the only male, Keiki, was reading a little-sister light novel.</p>
<p class="null-p">If one were to ask why exactly he was reading a little sister novel, his reason was that he wanted to heal his dry heart. After all, there were a few problems with this calligraphy club-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fuuu, it feels like recently I'm a bit stuck for ideas. It seems like I need some punishment from Keiki-kun to get me back on track." Pervert number one.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hardcore Senpai who wants her male Kouhai to make him her pet: Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai is as much of a pervert as always. Yuika would rather give Keiki-senpai some punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Pervert number two.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hardcore sadistic Kouhai who wants to make her male Senpai into a slave: Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kiryuu. I need some more references for my manga, so could you make an expression like you're being pushed down by another man?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pervert Number three.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fujoshi who uses her male classmate as a model for her BL manga: Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuuu…It's a bit hot today, isn't it, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pervert number four.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's exibitionistic little sister, who was nonchalantly opening the upper buttons of her shirt in order to purposefully show him her bra: Kiryuu Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">-As you can see, every female member of the calligraphy club was a pervert through and through.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, his little sister Mizuha had been Keiki's only anchor in a sea of perverts, but now that he had found out about her hidden fetish, he had to escape to the world of fiction to be healed by fictional little sisters.</p>
<p class="null-p">As an aside, nobody besides Keiki had found out about Mizuha's hidden fetish yet. Apparently, Mizuha didn't have any intention of coming out, so aside from this small bit of teasing just now, she usually kept it low-key inside of the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, the little sister in that novel is really cute~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san is flirting with a fictional little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">While completely disregarding the perverted girls' statements, he continued to run away to the safe haven of fictional little sisters. Suddenly, a knocking sound came from the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The door opened and a female student with one eye hidden by her bangs stepped in. The colour of her ribbon was beige, just like Mao's and Mizuha's, indicating that she was also a second-year student. It was of course the student council vice president, Fujimoto Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, if it isn't Fujimoto-san. Is anything wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she was tasked with club-related work, Ayano would often visit the clubs like this. Normally, her business would be with the club president, namely Sayuki, but her gaze went straight past her and focused on the boy reading the light novel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I came here because I have business with Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the name that the vice president spoke, the members of the club started whispering among themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been thinking; Isn't she a bit too close to Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also saw them being all clingy before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika saw them hugging each other in the materials room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, what is this about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">All the girls suddenly directed their cold gazes towards the only boy in the room. Without confessing that Ayano had actually a fetish for body odors, he bluntly averted his eyes. Of course, that only brought forth even greater displeasure and doubts. In the middle of that stuffy atmosphere, Ayano walked towards Keiki in a calm manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit sudden, but I would like to rent Kiryuu-kun here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rent?" I asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decline. Ask someone else," Sayuki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Sayuki-senpai answering for me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Ayano glanced over at Sayuki with her non-hidden eye, and…</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want to resist, I might be forced to decrease the budget for the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do with Keiki-kun as you please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having received permission, Ayano tightly grasped Keiki's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So with that being said, I will have you come with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, wait a second? Why am I treated like an object here? Is it really fine to sell me out for the club budget?"</p>
<p class="null-p">These girls should be resisting Ayano right now, for several reasons.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we lose too much of the club budget, Yuika can't buy any more materials for her picture books."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd be a big problem if I couldn't buy any more ink for my manuscripts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it's fine for this cheating Nii-san to be taken away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's not a single ally here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, is it really fine to buy materials and ink and whatnot with the club budget like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had been sold for monetary goods, Keiki had no choice but to follow Ayano out of the room. After walking down the hallway for a short amount of time, her feet stopped, and she spoke her request.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright Kiryuu-kun. Please bless this poor Ayano-san with your underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki turned around and was about to walk back to where they had come from, but he felt his sleeve being suddenly grabbed. "Wait, that's not it. I really do have business with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What is it this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki realized that Ayano wouldn't give up that easily, so he gave up on escaping for now. Although she was respected by teachers and students alike, her smell fetish was more than enough to make it a net negative. But alas, you couldn't find anything to complain about concerning her looks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You know… Umm, I have request for Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-A request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had absolutely no experience with a girl asking him something this cutely, Keiki's heart skipped a beat. Even though he already knew that there had to be a catch, he couldn't help but expect something. And, of course, it turned exactly how the rational part of his brain thought that it would.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is some equipment that I need to carry to the storehouse. Can you help me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, I thought that it would be something like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that a no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. You gave me those tickets for the pool before, so I'll gladly help you out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then Ayano-san will go borrow the keys for the storehouse, so can you wait in the student council office?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had heard that the student council was currently in dire need of male members. Since Keiki would've probably just been wasting his time reading that little sister novel, he might as well help out where he could.</p>
<p class="null-p">Separating from Ayano, Keiki made his way to the student council office and knocked on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he entered the room, a girl with light brown hair tied up in twintails greeted him. The colour of her ribbon was green, meaning that she was, like Yuika, his kouhai. Her height seemed to be on par with Yuika's, or maybe she was a slight bit taller. For some reason, she looked like she was in a bad mood. Her eyes were filled with hostility as she directed her gaze at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you have some business with the student council?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, uhm… Fujimoto-san told me to wait here." "I see. So you're the person who's going to help us out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmph, she snorted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am the treasurer of the student council, Nagase Airi. As you can see, I'm a first-year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, my name is-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no need for you to introduce yourself, Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, you know about me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai is pretty famous, after all. You've built up a harem with the beautiful female members of the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that? I can't let you say that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course you are. I have no memory of doing that whatsoever." "But there are countless rumours going around of you hugging the third-year Tokihara-senpai and the first-year Koga-san, you know? Not to mention that you always had this lecherous expression on your face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do I really make that kind of face…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But he couldn't exactly deny the rumours since those incidents really did happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This two-timing… This is exactly why men are so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's really not like that… But, still… I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki instinctively apologized when she glared at him like a worthless insect. Maybe she was right, and what he was doing was in fact indecent.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, having two beautiful girls fight for me like she thinks they do… Please tell me where I can sign up for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He suddenly felt the urge to go back to his normal days because of this conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Have we met somewhere before, Nagase-san? It feels like we have, at least…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What is that? Is that your way of hitting on me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not! It's really not, so please don't put more distance between us like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being rejected like that really hurt his poor heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmph. But yes, this isn't our first meeting. Don't you remember?</p>
<p class="null-p">We met back during the garbage gathering."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, now that you mention it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it makes sense that a plain, boring girl like me wouldn't be remembered."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nobody said anything like that… And also, Nagase-san isn't plain at all. You're really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to throw up, really. Please stop that right now. Is this how you close the distance so that you can sink your poisonous fangs into girls? This is exactly why I hate playboys."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_13.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"…Playboys…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It certainly looked like this kouhai named Airi Nagase didn't have a very good opinion of Keiki. Apparently she thought that Keiki was planning on building a harem with the calligraphy club members, and that he was nothing more than a playboy. Of course, he was actually a virgin who had never once in his life had a girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, you seem to have a pretty big misunderstanding. I've never even gone out with a girl before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a lie. How could I believe that? You're all lovey-dovey with those cute girls all the time. Do you have proof?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a virgin, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Time stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably embarrassed, the girl averted her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I'm sorry, I guess." She said with a sympathetic voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">This one phrase hurt the most out of all the ones she's said to me so far.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the girl unintentionally inflicted a small trauma on the poor boy's heart, the door opened and Ayano-san peeked into the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, sorry to make you wai-Huh? What happened?" She glanced between them with a quizzical look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly afterwards, Airi hid behind her and pointed at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Vice president, please save me! This man has been ogling me all this time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really didn't, but whatever…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, this Kouhai was rather narcissistic.</p>
<p class="null-p">After packing the necessary materials that Ayano needed help with, Keiki finally was freed from Airi's cold gaze, and left the student council office behind with said Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like Nagase-san hates me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't mind it. She's a bit hard to deal with. Apparently, she hates boys in general."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I thought so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than hating Keiki specifically, she just hated men in general.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's not a bad girl. Rather, she's very kind. And I want her to be on good terms with Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I would like to be friends with her, but considering the circumstances, that might be a bit difficult…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi glared at Keiki like she was looking at trash. He really didn't think that he'd be able to become friends after that horrible first impression. First it was the olfactophile vice president, and now it's the misandric treasurer. Maybe all the student council members were weird like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">While making small talk with Ayano, they arrived at the school entrance, and after changing into their outdoor shoes, they stepped out of the building. And they finally arrived at the small storehouse at the back of the school building. Apparently, all the stuff that wasn't used anymore was stuffed in there, earning it the title 'Junk storehouse'. After unlocking the door with the key she brought with her, Ayano slowly pushed the door open. The inside was full of dust, with used gym-class mats lying around, and old costumes lining the walls. Looking around the inside, the name 'Junk storehouse' seemed rather apt. And, after finding an open place on the floor, Keiki set down the box he was carrying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that was heavy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the humid weather, Keiki had indeed worked up quite the sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work. You really helped me, so I'll treat you to some juice later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. You have to make sure that you stay hydrated. And also… this smell of Kiryuu-kun… Ahhh, the smell of sweat… Haaaah… Haaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not cling to me like that right now? It's way too hot for this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a cat in heat, Ayano clung to Keiki, and even though he tried to separate from her, she already had her arms wrapped around his back. Inside this narrow storehouse, the boy-girl pair were practically glued to one other, when…</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Nnn? The storehouse isn't locked."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki suddenly heard a grown-up sounding female voice outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This voice… Okita-sensei?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was probably checking around school grounds after classes had ended. The sound of her footsteps suddenly grew closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, he was being tightly hugged by a girl inside the storehouse. Being seen by a teacher right now certainly wouldn't end favourably. Trying to avoid that worst-case outcome, he pushed Ayano down onto an old gym mat that was lying around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, is someone in there? …Hmm? Was it just my imagination?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The teacher looked around inside the storehouse as she stood in the doorway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know who left the storehouse unlocked like this, but they really are irresponsible. And the key is still in the lock, for crying out loud."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly afterwards, a metallic sound rang out in the otherwise silent storehouse. Probably the door getting locked. And, after a short silence, Keiki could hear quiet footsteps, growing more and more distant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Whew, it seems like she didn't find us out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uhm, Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you, umm, let me get up now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said that, Keiki finally understood the position they were currently in. Currently, this young boy was pushing down a fellow female classmate, whose cheeks were burning bright red as her wavering eyes looked up at him. She finally looked away, slightly puffing out her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaaa?! S-Sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. I was the one who suddenly jumped on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he hurriedly separated from her, the girl slowly lifted up her body and brushed the dust off of her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And are you really fine with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, with what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sounded like the door got locked just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she told him this that bluntly, Keiki remembered that metallic sound he heard a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-Seriously?! There are still people in here, you know?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He rattled on the door, but to no avail. Even after knocking furiously, he received no response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-So we're locked in…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A development you would normally only ever see in manga or light novels. The so-called 'locked in the storehouse event,' where the protagonist would be all alone with a girl for an indefinite amount of time. Every time he had seen that happen in media, he always shrugged it off with a "There's no way something like that would actually happen." But look at him now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just the two of us… with Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Ayano started fidgeting. She looked up at Keiki with a troubled expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi told me before. That all men are wolves."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, she's not exactly wrong about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this Ayano-san going to get eaten by Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not happening. I'm not into perverts at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">He certainly couldn't see this girl as a member of the opposite sex. She's the kind of girl who would start panting because of the scent of his sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. I don't have any desires like that for Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For some reason, that doesn't make me happy at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl seemed to have a hurt expression because of his response, but Keiki didn't know why.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what should we do about this? What if nobody comes by?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, we still have ways to get out of here… Like the window?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked around the interior, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? No, they're way too small…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There were indeed windows that let some sunlight into this otherwise pitch-black storehouse, but they were far too small to fit through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I know! In times like these, we have to use our smartphones! What else would they be for, if not as a saving grace right now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But my smartphone is back in the student council office."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No worries. I have mine with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking out his smartphone, he turned on the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yikes, the battery's about to run out."</p>
<p class="null-p">The only lifeline they had left was currently running at a whopping three percent battery. He'd probably forgotten to charge it the previous night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I have to hurry and call someone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">One single call would probably be all it could handle. He had to properly think this through. The condition would be that said person still has to be on school grounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma should currently be busy with his club activities, and that means that his stalker Koharu would be equally busy. All that's left were the club members, but Yuika and Mao always left school quickly, so the risk was too high. The same could be said about</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha, since she might have gone home early to prepare dinner. Then, that only leaves-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'm betting everything on Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when he was about to tap on the call button, his phone vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An email? From Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suspecting nothing, he calmly opened it up.</p>
<p class="null-p">'A service for my lovable Nii-san. Freshly taken~'</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown on the screen was but one photo. A truly magnificent photo, which showed the valley of Mizuha's breasts from above. In that moment while he was appreciating and also cursing this lovable service from his little sister, his phone battery ran out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Around one hour had passed since they had been locked in. "…Nobody's coming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, I can't imagine anyone having any reason to come here except us."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the meantime, Keiki had tried yelling for help countless times, but no saviour arrived. They were now sitting on the gym mat with their backs facing each other, preserving their energy while they waited.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that someone from the student council will come once they realize how long I've been missing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have no other option except to hope for that, it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">The only reason they could keep calm right now was because there was still hope.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That aside, it's really hot today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The ventilation in here isn't all that great, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, if the windows were big enough to allow for better ventilation, they would have already escaped from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though summer vacation was over, that didn't mean that the outdoor temperature would drop quickly. They had the windows open, but the sweat still wouldn't stop forming on their foreheads.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wondered how much time had passed. No matter how long they waited, no help arrived. And, while he was in the middle of thinking that, Ayano suddenly grabbed Keiki's shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… I-I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, something like this is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, it made sense that she would be worried in this situation. If even the manly Keiki was scared, then this girl must be terrified.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Help will come."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. How about we talk about something? Anything is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keeping quiet wouldn't help anyone, so they might as well hold a conversation to brighten up the mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then is it fine if I ask you something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure, go ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the colour of your underwear today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's sexual harassment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Ayano-san's panties are black."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, that's quite the sexy route…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the conversation had started with Ayano's sexual harassment, he clearly saw an improvement in her expression, because she now had a slight smile on her face. She seemed like she wanted to know more about Keiki, and was willing to tell him about herself. Thanks to that, Keiki learned a lot of things about the girl Fujimoto Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-And, because Ayano-san kept her distance like that, she lost all her friends. It was all about studying. In order to change that, she entered the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was a bit surprised by the reason why she had joined the student council. He could tell that she wasn't the type to take drastic action on her own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san is amazing. I'm totally the type of person who runs away from things I'm bad at."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wonder. I don't really know myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like Nagase-san has taken a liking to you, and you're on good terms with the other club members too, right? That's the result of your hard work."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew very well how serious Ayano was working as the vice president. That's why everyone around her looks up to her so much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard no response, Keiki turned around to look at her, only to find Ayano's gaze glued to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, no. It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, his classmate started panicking a bit, and she started fidgeting. Just from the dim light coming from the window, Keiki could see that her cheeks were red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your face is a bit red. Are you feeling hot?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki softly brushed away the hair on her forehead and placed his hand there. Taken by surprise, the girl's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Kiryuu-kun?! What are you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…? I'm checking your temperature… Ah, that's hot. Maybe you have a fever?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face had gotten even more red, and Ayano was now spacing out while gazing at Keiki. Her eyes looked a bit damp, so Keiki figured that she might really have a fever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If you do something like that, I can't hold back…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, right? This is Kiryuu-kun's fault, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these perplexing words, she suddenly jumped onto Keiki. Reaching out around his back with her hands, she rammed her head into Keiki's chest region.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, amazing… What a crazy smell… Haaah… haaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Augh?! Why does it always end like this?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, because of this heat, and Kiryuu-kun's already strong smell… I can't… Hold back…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do I really smell that bad?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">So the reason why her face was red was because she was excited from getting a whiff of Keiki's odor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… Haaah… Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun's… has gotten a bit hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly are you talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">-And that concludes the long flashback.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, Keiki was in the middle of being attacked by a pervert, behind the school building inside a dark storehouse. And the worst problem was that Keiki had no method of running away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun… Kiryuu-kun…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of his eyes was, of course, Ayano, pressing her body against him.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_14.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, wait?! Your breasts! Your breasts are hitting meeeee!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time the girl moved, that soft feeling hitting his body made him twitch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah, I can't. I can't hold back any more! Kiryuu-kun, let me sniff your underwear!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?! Don't just pull of my paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaants!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl tried her hardest to gain access to Keiki's underwear. Or a goldmine, as far as she was concerned. Seeing this behaviour, Keiki felt bad for her future lover.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment that Keiki was about to become defiled by his classmate, however-</p>
<p class="null-p">With a loud bang, the door to the storehouse opened. The person standing in the doorway looked around the interior, and her shoulders started shaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing there was the treasurer of the student council: Nagase Airi. And it was no wonder that she was so agitated. Inside the storehouse, a male student had his pants pulled down, exposing his trunks, and a girl with a red face was trying to press her face against said trunks. Not to mention that both of them were sweating profusely. No matter how you looked at it, they were totally in the middle of 'that act'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was wondering why you didn't come back, and this is what you were doing?! On school grounds?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How brave of you to say that in this situation! I can't believe that you would try to assault Fujimoto-senpai like this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not doing anything of that sort, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was actually the one who was being assaulted here. But Nagase was so agitated that she wouldn't listen until Ayano herself explained the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ahh, now that you mention it, I do remember the vice president telling me that had a fetish like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the members of the student council knew about Ayano's perverted desires.</p>
<p class="null-p">With Keiki's chastity having been protected, they left the storehouse behind them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. You saved us, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't show me any gratitude. I didn't come here to save you or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, let me give you my thanks. Thanks to you, my precious chastity was protected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say something indecent like that! Really, this is why boys are awful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was showering Keiki in verbal abuse, she had indeed come to search for them because she was worried, so she really seemed like the good girl Ayano made her out to be. Keiki thought that this tsundere act was quite cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Vice president! I finished my job, so I will take my leave for today!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying only that, Airi left the two alone. They also headed for the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun? Why are you keeping so much distance between us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Trying putting your hand on your chest before you ask."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry. I kind of lost myself back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kind of…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded like she was even worse when she completely lost herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I had fun. Not to mention that I got to enjoy Kiryuu-kun's odour, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well I now have a new trauma on my list that I'll remember until I die, so thank you for that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, aren't you interested in a part-time job?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Part-time job?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the simple job of becoming Ayano-san's hugging pillow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a shame… But one day, I'll definitely be able to hold Kiryuukun's underwear in my hands."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you be so kind as to give up on that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-san won't give up. I will definitely get Kiryuu-kun's underwear… and maybe even Kiryuu-kun himself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that about Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing at all… Fufu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, the vice president looked rather pleased. Whatever the reason, she certainly wasn't planning on giving up.</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day after classes, Keiki made his way towards the clubroom building, and found a familiar girl with twintails standing in front of the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, isn't that Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Full name, Nagase Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kohai of his, with whom he had conversed a bit the day prior. And right now, she was acting suspicious, namely fidgeting and tapping her feet as she was standing in front of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yesh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki called out to her, Airi bit her tongue in surprise while responding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kiryuu-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Do you have some business with the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no… I actually have business with Kiryuu-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still looking a bit restless, she looked up at Keiki. It was a completely different atmosphere from yesterday. Now it felt like the prelude to a confession scene, which made Keiki feel a bit nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Umm, I'm sorry about yesterday!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She suddenly bowed to Keiki. Of course, Keiki didn't really understand why she had suddenly done that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I don't really get it… What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though Kiryuu-senpai was nice enough to help with our student council work, I was very rude towards you, so I reflected on it after I got home. That is why I came here today to apologize, and to thank you for yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thank you very much for yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi gently smiled at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh, she really is a good girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're very welcome. I think that it's very admirable to apologize like that, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought that his Kouhai was really cute, so he went into older brother mode and gently stroked her head. Maybe it was also because she was a bit taller than Yuika, but he found it a bit easier for him to do this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Hawa."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hawa?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ukyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after her head got patted like this, the Kouhai let out a shriek and distanced herself from Keiki. Her face went red in an instant, and she was now glaring at Keiki instead. "What are you doing so suddenly?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, I was stroking your head?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know what you did, but don't get excited just because I forgave you and thanked you! I can't believe you! Using any chance to suddenly touch a girl like this! This is why men are so awful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, this behaviour seemed familiar. To be precise, it was perfectly identical to the situation from the day prior.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like the rumour about Senpai trying to build a harem with the calligraphy club members was true after all! You really are my enemy! No, the enemy of every woman!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl naming herself his enemy pointed at Keiki in rage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you, I'm not trying to build a harem, nor am I as much of a womanizer as you think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever it is, the fact that you were stroking my head without permission is a fact! And this anger of mine will not be quenched until you have been punished for your evil deeds!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what kind of punishment do you have in mind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… I'll have to think about that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She hadn't thought of anything at all, is what that statement meant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway! You'll just have to wait until I came up with something! That will be all for today, so if you'll excuse me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her beige-coloured hair fluttered as she turned around and walked way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What was that about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki didn't know what to make of the situation, he knew that he had probably caught the attention of yet another troublesome girl. Whether it be Ayano or Airi, this student council seemed to be quite the unusual crowd. Not to mention that he was about to enter the pervert-filled clubroom of the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">While praying, Please don't let anything weird happen, Keiki slowly opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a certain weekday at the beginning of August, and the time of day was noon. Since he was on library duty today, Keiki was making his way over to his workplace when he spotted Shouma and Koharu sitting on a bench in the courtyard, being lovey-dovey. While they were doing the 'Open-wide' feeding event, Koharu's eyes happened to meet Keiki's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, her face turned red."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't help but think that her blushing face looked really cute. Flustered, she awkwardly waved at Keiki, until she turned around to resume the lovey-dovey 'Open wide~" game.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, they're still going."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Shouma called it between being more than friends and less than lovers, to an outsider like Keiki, this could only be a couple that was flirting. Inside the classroom, a rumour had been going around that Shouma was going out with a loli girl. Apparently, they weren't holding back on their lovey-doveyness, even while on school grounds. But they also went on dates on holidays, and fed each other with their lunchboxes-</p>
<p class="null-p">This was something that Keiki was always wishing for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm really envious."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he had finally figured out the identity of his Cinderella, he still hadn't managed to get a girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just want to experience a normal love, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Around him, there were only girls with distorted wishes, nothing more. Kiryuu Keiki's romcom might still be far off.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day after classes, Keiki was inside the calligraphy clubroom, sitting on a chair. He let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaaah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Nii-san?" Mizuha asked, seeing that her older brother didn't seem to be in high spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I saw a couple being lovey-dovey inside the courtyard at lunch break, so I thought that I also wanted to experience love like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's love you want, you just have to make me your girlfriend, right, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A normal love with a normal girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what exactly does 'normal' mean to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you know. Getting a lap pillow from your girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did give you a lap pillow before, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or getting to eat her homemade food."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do that every day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, when the atmosphere is right, k-kissing and such."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We already kissed, though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, those romcom events kept happening between him and Mizuha. And, as of right now, Mizuha was the girl who came closest to his picture of an ideal girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a beauty, with no room for complaints. She was kind, yet still strict if it was for his benefit. The fact that her breasts were quite large was also a huge plus for him. Now that he had found out that they weren't blood-related, she could openly show her feelings for him. If only she wasn't an exibitionist, then she would indeed be the perfect girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what about you? What's your kind of ideal love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For me, it would be being able to do a strip show inside Nii-san's room. Imagining myself slowly taking off my clothes while Nii-san is passionately watching me… Kyaa~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I mean! That's not normal at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how cute she looked, this girl was still a pervert to her core.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For crying out loud… Why am I surrounded by all these perverted girls…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As an aside, Keiki and Mizuha were the only people present right now inside the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Mizuha, why did you suddenly join the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… That's a secret."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just because… Well, it's also because I want to be together even more with the person I love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Those surprise attacks really aren't fair, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter if she was a pervert or not, Keiki's virgin heart wasn't strong enough to withstand continuous attacks like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">And while both of them kept talking about this and that, Sayuki, Yuika, and Mao entered the clubroom one by one. Now there were five club members. At first, it had only been Keiki and Sayuki, but they had become a proper club now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-It seems like everyone is here."</p>
<p class="null-p">When everyone was present, Sayuki spoke up. Though she was acting like she had called them to a meeting, the other club members had no idea what their agenda was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The other day, when Mizuha-san joined, our club finally reached five members. Since our number has grown this large, how about we plan an event that can help strengthen our bonds?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Event?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every member except Sayuki looked at her in confusion, and the club president proudly declared the following:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our club will conduct a training camp next weekend!"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: A certain calligraphy club's seaside training camp.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Summer! Sea! A training caaaaaamp!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is excited because he's seeing everyone in swimsuits again."</p>
<p class="null-p">They left the city early in the morning, got most of the way there by train, and rode the rest of the way by bus. Altogether it took them roughly three hours. The five members of the calligraphy club had arrived at a private beach owned by the Ootori household. Though the season had progressed towards the beginning of September, it was still very hot, and this heat wasn't to be trifled with. That was why all the girls present where still in attire befitting the height of summer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was wearing a blouse and a thick long skirt, while Yuika's body was wrapped in a one-piece. Mao had decided on a sleeveless shirt and shorts, giving her a boyish look. In contrast, Mizuha wore cargo pants, making it easy for her to move. Since he was the only boy, Keiki was entrusted with carrying various packages and the cooler filled with food and drinks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, look! It's a private residence! A real one!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, you're right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A large building was standing proudly in the distance in the direction Yuika pointed. Today, they would be staying the night in that residence, and they would go home on the following day; Sunday. "Hmm… I can't see any men wearing obscene swimsuits…" Mao said something very fujoshi-like.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because this is a private beach," Mizuha calmly stated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doesn't it feel great, having all of this just for us? It's reserved only for us!" Yuika let out an excited voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like the girls were acting excited now that they had actually arrived at the beach. In the midst of that, Keiki called out to Sayuki, who had been the one who organized this training camp.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really managed to just borrow the residence like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's all thanks to Ootori-san. She said that it's thanks for helping out with the event at the pool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Koharu-senpai really was in a tight spot back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I became email penpals with Ootori-san after that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, so you're quite close now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it bothers me a bit that Ootori-san doesn't stop talking about Akiyama-kun. Even though I have absolutely no interest in Ikemenkun, I became quite knowledgeable about him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence. So did I."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Ootori was completely blinded by love, it made sense for her to boast about the person she liked to the whole world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, lets go and put down our luggage first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaaaay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following the club president's orders, everyone started moving. At first glance, the building that they were closing in on looked just like any normal home. Of course, since it was so close to the sea, it had a spacious deck to match. Opening the door with the key Sayuki had received, the group went inside. The first room that they entered was the living room, which was spacious and had a tall ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, the inside is also pretty roomy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And clean. There's no dust at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Mizuha, the clean freak, was the first person to look for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apparently, caretakers give it frequent maintenance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Caretakers…? Just how much financial power does the Ootori household have?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki already knew that the Ootori household wasn't lacking for money, hearing that they owned a private beach including a mansion with paid caretakers was still quite the shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, let's decide on the room assignments."</p>
<p class="null-p">This building had three bedrooms, and all of them could be found on the second floor. And it seemed that every room had two beds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I will be sleeping with Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly do you mean by 'Of course'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's weird proposal was rejected immediately. In the end, since he was the only boy, it was decided that Keiki would be sleeping alone in one room. The other pairs would be Mao with Mizuha and Sayuki with Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha and Nanjou in the same room, huh…? Hey Nanjou, you'd better not show Mizuha any weird BL manga, all right? I don't want to lose her to the world of darkness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you, her mother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just worried that you'll infect my cute little sister with your weird hobby."</p>
<p class="null-p">If his sister were a fujoshi on top of being an exibitionist, that would completely break Keiki's poor heart. And while he was busy being worried about his precious little sister's future, Yuika was glaring at Sayuki with a displeased expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sleeping in the same room as Witch-senpai? Yuika can feel her spine tingling from the feeling of danger."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. I'm devoted to Keiki-kun, so don't worry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're still saying that after making Yuika wear a bunny outfit and maid clothing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bunny outfit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since this wasn't something you'd hear that often in an everyday conversation, Mizuha stared at them in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mizuha-san! Are you interested? I made Koga-san wear something like that before. I can show you pictures later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is indeed very interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you please stop?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, the room distribution was decided upon, and everyone brought their belongings to their rooms. They left the cooler in the kitchen and put everything perishable into the refrigerator. When they had finished their preparations, the five of them once more gathered in the living room by the time the clock read 10am.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I guess we should start the real deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what are we doing first?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe. That's obvious. There is only one thing to do with the wide open sea right next to us! Everyone, change into your swimsuits!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaaaay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, no member of the calligraphy club was against that proposition.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike the girls, Keiki had changed in a single moment. After taking everything off and slipping into his swimming trunks, Keiki realized that something was missing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I forgot to bring a towel… I might as well get one from the bathroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the room with this swimming trunks on, he headed down to the first floor. It seemed as if the other girls were still in the middle of changing, since nobody greeted him down in the living room. When he arrived at the bathroom, Keiki flung open the door without a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Fue?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, whose voice was that? In this bathroom, four girls were currently in the middle of taking off their clothes. Because of the sudden appearance of the uninvited guest, all the girls froze in place. And the boy himself froze, because he found the scenery in front of him too stimulating for words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's magnificent chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's undersized butt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's plump thighs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's slim bodyline.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, who could blame Keiki that he didn't have the willpower to look away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, uh… I thought that you were all changing in your rooms…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he came up with an excuse…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaaaaaa!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside this residence isolated from any other civilization, four girl's screams rang out at the exact same moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…How nice… Everyone looks like they're having fun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a plate hanging around his neck that read 'I peeked on the girls changing', and forced to sit down on the hot sandy beach, Keiki was watching the four girls gleefully play volleyball. Indeed, this was his punishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone one of them has grown so splendidly, and their breasts are going bouncy bouncy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The big breasted Sayuki, the Mizuha who didn't look that big while she had normal clothes on, and the refreshing size of Mao. Though Yuika certainly couldn't compete when it came to size, her breasts indeed had their own charm. Though Keiki felt happy that he was able to see their appearances all to himself, sitting over here all by himself was raining on his parade a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… Would you be so kind as to forgive me now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He tried calling out to them. When he did, the girls stopped their game and gathered in front of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, have you reflected on what you've done?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I reflected very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, your gaze is still focused on Witch-senpai's chest, though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was found out by Yuika, Keiki averted his gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu really is an ero devil."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is a breast sommelier, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For me, it's more of a reward though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai, don't get the urge to breed here."</p>
<p class="null-p">The upperclassman's cheeks turned red and she started fidgeting. In response, Yuika glared at her. After their exchange, however, Sayuki looked at bit more serious as she began speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All four of us got together and decided on the punishment for this peeping tom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Sitting here wasn't my punishment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We wouldn't forgive you by having you sit down," the black-haired upperclassman let out a giggle, "If you want us to forgive you, then you'll have to listen to our individual requests."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Just for reference, where's my option to decline?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nonexistent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though this felt like nothing but trouble, Keiki had no other choice but to accept their condition.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Punishment Number 1: The case of Tokihara Sayuki]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I will have you rub sunscreen on my back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was lying down underneath a huge parasol, looking at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, hurry up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had taken off her bikini top, and her bare back was in plain sight. Her big breasts were clearly visible from the sides. The impact of her body, which was much more than the average high school student, was too much for the girlfriend-less Keiki.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_15.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, what's wrong? You've already hugged me at the pool when my bikini top was washed away, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I could only do that since I was so desperate!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should you really be this embarrassed here? In the future when I become Keiki-kun's pet, you will wash my body every day." "I will neither wash your body nor become your master!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you can't do this, then I can't help it. Instead, I'll have you go home tomorrow with 'Peeking Devil' written on your face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it! I will do it! I just have to do it, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting some lotion on his hands, he slowly brought them closer to Sayuki's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, can you not let out such a weird voice like that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. It was colder than I expected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So she said, but when Keiki resumed his work…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn… Ahhh…! Haaah… haaah… That's good, Keiki-kun… Very good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Thanks for that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, more! Be more rough! Rub it onto me…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's only sunscreen, okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after that, every time Keiki moved his hands, the girl let out groans and her breathing grew more rough. Of course, the other three girls watched the situation unfold with cold stares.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You know, isn't this unacceptable in a lot of ways?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could totally play this as an audio track over an erotic video, and nobody would suspect a thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you're the worst…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao, Yuika and Mizuha all gave their (negative) opinions on the situation unfolding in front of them. And even though Keiki was only doing as he was told, he felt his popularity decreasing.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Punishment Number 2: The case of Koga Yuika]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, what's wrong, Keiki-senpai? Try catching Yuika if you can!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah… Ufff… Haaah… T-This is pretty impossible, don't you think…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's wish was for both of them to play a game of tag. But, in order to give the boy a handicap, his hands were tied together behind his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you think about the sea, this is perfect, don't you think? Here, try to catch Yuika!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahaha, this girl…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, no matter how much he was able to catch up to her, his situation didn't allow him to get a hold of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aha, Keiki-senpai, you're too slow."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that the girl was purposefully stopping from time to time to provoke him. Letting him catch up in order to give him hope, only to evade him at the last second again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… Haaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? Senpai, you're giving up already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki was almost at death's door.</p>
<p class="null-p">…But, if I gave up here, I wouldn't have the right to call myself a man!</p>
<p class="null-p">Men have battles that they can't afford to lose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a deep breath, he directed his determined gaze at the blondehaired girl in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, you really are cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fue?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said that out of the blue, Yuika's feet stopped. And Keiki certainly didn't let this chance go to waste.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An opening!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, not good!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting all the strength he had left into his legs, he closed in on the girl. He was about reach out to grab her, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">…Wait, how do I even catch her like his?</p>
<p class="null-p">He just now realized that he couldn't actually reach out with his hands. But he didn't have the time to turn around.</p>
<p class="null-p">-There's no other choice but to go head-first!</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, he had no other option right now. Not dwelling to deeply on it, he bumped right into Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a result, both of them collapsed onto the sand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch ouch… Eh? What is this… soft feeling on my head…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It took Keiki a second to realize that he was resting his head on Yuika's modest chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the unexpected occurrence, the girl needed a second, but finally…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, you idiot!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When that scream rang out, it was obvious that the winner of the game of tag was Keiki. And as for the reactions of Sayuki and the other girls, who were sitting on a blanket…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if Keiki-kun won't be satisfied unless he gets his fill of lucky pervert moments."</p>
<p class="null-p">"From watching this, you might even call this a sickness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you're the worst…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards Keiki, who was basically conducting sexual harassment, the other girls once more voiced their cold opinions.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Punishment Number 3: The case of Nanjou Mao]</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Hey, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? I won't listen to any complaints."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I apologize for peeking, and I really feel bad. And, I think that this is pretty soft as a punishment. I really do, but… aren't you going a bit too far?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, Keiki was on all fours, pushing out his butt. If you didn't know any better, it looked like he was about to 'receive'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that I was pretty soft to do this without telling you to take off your trunks, though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is sympathy! It's what makes you human!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, that expression is great~ I can use that for reference~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao, sitting in the shadow of a tree, had a sketchbook in her hand. And of course, the fujoshi's other hand was energetically drawing in said sketchbook.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu Fu Fu. This, this is good! Wonderful inspiration for my manga! Keeki and Shouto playing together on the beach… At first, everything went great, but suddenly, Shouto was unable to hold back his urges, and he pushed Keeki down and stripped him of his swimming trunks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhh, I feel like the scene is right in front of me! Shouto plays with Keeki's hole, and finally pushes his meatstick into there!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, but can you keep that much inside your head?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving this information, the poor boy would visualize it in his head, whether he wanted to or not. And Keiki doubted that he could forget about it for quite some time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, next is the scene inside the sea!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're doing more?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like this, his punishment as a BL manga model continued for around 1 hour.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… I've been defiled… I can't become a husband anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After everything had ended, Keiki was hugging his legs on the sandy beach, crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doing such a routine on a private beach. That was truly wonderful, Nanjou-san. I have to definitely get your new work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-senpai, Yuika can't wait for your new work!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, sorry… but I think I'm kinda looking forward to it, too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though those words from his precious little sister would've normally pushed Keiki over the edge, he was already unable to show any human emotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Punishment Number 4: The case of Kiryuu Mizuha]</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, uhm… what might Mizuha-san's request be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to be so afraid. I won't do anything bad to you or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I'm not really mad in the first place. I don't hate being seen by Nii-san. Rather, I'd like you to see even more of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just how should I respond to that statement…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">How should one react to his own little sister telling you "I want you to see me in my underwear"?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I guess I am mad that you saw the other girls. I want Nii-san to only look at me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder… This gives me a really bad feeling…</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why it should be fine if I tease you a bit, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tease?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Praise me? You have to praise me lots. Whatever comes to your mind that you could praise me about, I want to hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Announcing her request, the girl expectantly looked at Keiki. An embarrassing punishment indeed, but Keiki had no choice but to get it out of the way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I think that Mizuha is crazy cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That swimsuit looks so good on you that it gets my heart pumping."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that you being very proficient in everything householdrelated is very admirable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Mizuha's request, he kept praising her for whatever came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow this feels really embarrassing, though…?!</p>
<p class="null-p">And the gaze from the other members made him feel embarrassed for a different reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I was thinking this the other day, but isn't Mizuha-san a brocon of a crazy high level?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, doesn't Mizuha-senpai feel like a yandere today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just listening to it makes me feel embarrassed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Around three minutes of nonstop praising later, Mizuha had a satisfied smile on her face, and she said "I forgive you."</p>
<p class="null-p">And like that, Keiki had fulfilled every request the four girls had, and the peeping incident was finally forgiven.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, everyone enjoyed the sea, then they returned to the residence to eat lunch, and afterwards each of them went off to do their own thing. For dinner, they had a barbeque on the porch, talking about this and that while they were eating. Since they were in this different environment, it really felt like they were bonding more and more.</p>
<p class="null-p">That evening, as they were all happily conversing with each other, Sayuki went to her room and brought back a box with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I brought this with me today," she said, setting the box on the table and opening the lid.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside, the others saw several high-quality chocolate products.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That looks really expensive, though… What's up with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A good friend of my father brought this with him as a souvenir. Since my father isn't good with sweet stuff, I got it from him, so I thought we could eat it together."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard Sayuki's words, Ms. Considerate Mizuha stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go make some tea, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mizuha-senpai. Yuika will help you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, I'm counting on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few minutes, both of them returned with the tea. Mizuha once more sat down next to her older brother, while Yuika planted herself down next to Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let us eat, shall we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every member chose a piece of this high-grade chocolate and started chewing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, this is delicious. And it's not too sweet."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Mizuha who gave her impression first.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really is delicious. And it gives off this adult-like vibe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika gave her review shortly afterwards with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… This is indeed quite the taste… Though it has a weird scent," Mao tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is there alcohol in this chocolate, perchance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki asked his question…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it says that they are whisky bombons."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whisky bombons… is it really fine for minors like us to eat them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it should be fine. Western sweets often have brandy in them and you won't get drunk off of them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it had alcohol, those were just sweets. This should only be on the level of using sake for cooking. Thinking that, the members stuffed their mouths with chocolate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This might be a bit late, but why did you suddenly decide to hold a training camp?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said it the other day, but now that Koga-san, Nanjou-san, and Mizuha-san have joined the club, we can finally hold proper club activities. That's why I thought we might as well strengthen our bonds like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, that makes sense. So what was your real intention?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To use this chance to make Keiki-kun think that it would be profitable to make me his pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">So she was planning on going on the offensive during this trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? You haven't given up on Keiki-senpai yet, Witch-senpai?" "That's the same for Koga-san, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Yuika will not hand Keiki-senpai over to someone else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have don't plan on becoming either an owner or slave, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki thought this was important, he used his chance to stress the point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But still, thank you very much. This is the first time Yuika has gone on a training camp like this, so Yuika had a lot of fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's with that so suddenly…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was taken aback by Yuika's sudden honesty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just like Yuika said. I'm also having fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course Nanjou had fun. Making me do all these weird poses earlier…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha. That was cruel in a lot of ways."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki remembered that embarrassing scene, and Yuika let out a gleeful laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki asked his seat neighbour Mizuha, she let out a surprised voice and started smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah. I'm also having fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, there was a sense of discomfort behind that smile. It almost felt like she was forcing herself to smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that just my imagination…?</p>
<p class="null-p">But in the end, Keiki gave up on thinking about it. After that, time passed without any great incident. However, as soon as the final chocolate piece vanished-it started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hick…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehehe. Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Mizuha leaned against her older brother and let out a playful voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nii-san, will you stroke my head? Like you always do at home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? But we're not at home right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he hesitated because of the stares from the other female club members, Keiki's one weakness was spoiling his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, I guess I can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehehehe…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki started stroking her head, his little sister closed her eyes and let out a pleased giggle. Mao responded after seeing those two being lovey-dovey like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that looks nice. Will you do it for me too~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What are you saying, Nanjou? That's totally not something you'd normally ask at all."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_16.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that? There are times when even I want to be spoiled, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Getting up from her seat, Mao sat down on his opposite side and pushed her head towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, stroke my head too~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this bad feeling I'm getting here?</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha aside, Mao had never acted like this before. And of course, the strange circumstances didn't stop there-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then after Mao-senpai, it's Yuika's turn~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's my turn. I want Keiki-kun to spoil me, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mao, Yuika and Sayuki also raised their voices. And their way of talking seemed a bit off to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You guys… Aren't your faces a bit red?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The weird premonition inside Keiki grew more intense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You guys… Are you drunk?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who ish drunk?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's totally what a drunk person would say!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the girls had gulped down the whisky bonbons a bit too fast, and had gotten drunk. No matter the amount, alcohol was still alcohol.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muuu… Kiryuu, if you don't stroke my head, I'll be taking off the pants, okay?" Mao slurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot. I'm saying that I will take off your panties, so that I can get a good look at your son down there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again with this?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a face as red as an apple, she closed in on Keiki's lower half.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, it's fine~~~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a scream like a young maiden about to be defiled, he tried his hardest to keep his pants on, but to no avail. Despair was starting to close in on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please wait a moment, Mao-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before you pull off Keiki-senpai's underwear, shouldn't you be taking off your own panties first?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, what are you saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. That makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No it doesn't?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Yuika's nonsensical proposition, the fujoshi responded with a nod of understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why don't we all just take off our panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation spun into complete absurdity with Sayuki's proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai! Nice idea! Keiki-senpai likes a girl's panties, right? He was frantically searching through Yuika's panties in her room before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, Kiryuu, you like panties that much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufufu, really, Keiki-kun, what a pervert~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nii-san likes them that much, then I guess that even I, his little sister, have to take mine off too, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of this unbelievable development, Mao and Yuika slowly started taking off their shorts and cargo shorts. Unlike Sayuki, who was wearing a skirt, and Yuika, who was wearing a one-piece, they wouldn't be able to take off their panties without doing that first.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, wai-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They ignored Keiki's scream as they reached for their underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's panties were a fire red, while Yuika's were a soothing blue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had been wearing a grown-up purple pair, and Mizuha's were green.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they all had finished, they each held their panties towards Keiki, and gave him expectant gazes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Hey, Keiki-kun. Whose panties do you want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The long, black-haired upperclassman said in a soft, sweet voice. Of course, this sight was so unreal for Keiki that he didn't know how to react.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know whose to choose here…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being a total beta, Keiki had no other choice but to run away from the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dashing further and further away from the living room, Keiki made his way upwards on the second floor, but not to his own room. Rather, he ran towards the bedroom the farthest in the back, namely the one that belonged to Sayuki and Yuika. Inside the dark room, he spotted bags and other luggage. Though he saw several pieces of underwear lying on top of the bed, he completely ignored them and hid in the nearby closet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad… My sixth sense is telling me that this is very bad…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The alcohol was currently greatly influencing the girls' ability to think rationally. All of them suddenly taking their panties off without a care in the world was all the proof he needed. And now that they had lost their rational thinking, what kind of hideous things would they force Keiki to participate in?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhhh… and I also feel a bit weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it was because of the alcohol, but his head felt heavy. Though this was the first time he had felt like this, he wouldn't call it a pleasant feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Still, it's pretty quiet right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he focused on listening, he couldn't hear anything except his own heartbeat. Maybe the girls had fallen asleep because of their drunkness. And in the moment when he quietly peeked through the gap between the doors-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Found you~"</p>
<p class="null-p">He met eyes those of a girl outside the closet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, why are you so shocked? If you act like that, it makes Yuika want to tease you even more, you know?" A blonde-haired girl with an angel-like smile said those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, since she had found the person she had been searching for, she hurriedly opened the closet doors.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you were hiding here, I see. But what a shame. It's so easy for Yuika-chan to find Senpai~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it was because of the alcohol, but her way of speaking sounded more cheerful than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Senpai. Please accept Yuika's panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't need your panties!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Then Yuika will give you this instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">The item that she was now pushing at Keiki was what had triggered this whole situation. Of course, it was nothing other than the chocolate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you eat this, you'll get this fluffy feeling, you know? Let's feel good together, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nobody should eat any more of that! This chocolate is-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mugu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki could finish his sentence, the chocolate was stuffed into his mouth at an alarming speed. Not to mention that it was two pieces instead of just one. And in order to make sure that he wouldn't spit them out, Yuika closed Keiki's mouth with her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mguuguhghu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Now get a good taste, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was trapped inside this narrow closet, he had no other choice but to swallow the chocolate. Even though it was faint, he could still taste and smell the whisky, and his world slowly started spinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Ahhh, this one's done for. I can't…</p>
<p class="null-p">With these thoughts, Keiki's consciousness left him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki came back to his senses, he was pushing down a certain girl on a bed. His location was still the same bedroom as before, with the moonlight illuminating just enough for Keiki to identity the person he was pushing down as Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Huh? Somehow, it feels like something like this has happened before?</p>
<p class="null-p">But his devastating headache prevented him from remembering the details.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, that doesn't really matter right now anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, Keiki was better off focusing on the girl in front of him, whose body was still wrapped in her white one-piece. Her white shoulders, her fluffy, comfy-looking blonde-hair, and first and foremost, her gemstone-like blue eyes were all perfectly visible.</p>
<p class="null-p">When you look at her like this, she really is cute, isn't she…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Lying upwards, the girl looked at him, her eyes slightly filled with fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki… senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably wasn't able to keep up with the sudden development. That voice calling out his name had no strength to it at all, and she was merely looking up at him while spacing out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, you really did tease me a lot today, didn't you? …No, not just today. You pushed your panties into my mouth. I've had my chest molested by you, I've been treated like a slave by you, and many other things."</p>
<p class="null-p">-That's right. Ever since Keiki found out about her fetish, the days had been hard for him. This displeasure and frustration was now slowly, unconsciously starting to leak out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, even I'm starting to get angry about all of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Umm… Yuika is sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tears slowly started building up in the corners of Yuika's eyes. She was probably afraid of the sudden change to her upperclassman's personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So to make you reflect on it, don't you think that some sort of punishment is appropriate?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Punishment…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just like Yuika-chan always says, right? -Bad kids need a 'scolding'."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, Keiki's mouth formed a grin, and he brought both of his hands towards Yuika's small chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-Senpai?! Where are you touch-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no room for complaints!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl let out a cute shriek as her breasts were fondled against her will. But with a stubbornness worthy of a sadistic queen like her, she didn't gave in. Instead she tightly shut her lips and glared at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Do you think that you will be forgiven for something like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh? But, Yuika-chan did the same to me before, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that reaction, Keiki's grin intensified, and he resumed toying with Yuika's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An?! Nnn…! Uuuu… Keiki-senpai was supposed to be the one to become Yuika's plaything after getting drunk, so why did it turn out like this…?! And also, Keiki-senpai, you're way too drunk!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Drunk am not I, no!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You totally are!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, these are really small… Aren't you embarrassed? You're a high school student but you only have these?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm sorry for being small!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying?! Being small is the best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which one is it now?! P-Please, stop this already!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't schtop!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the worst! Today Keiki-senpai is really the worst!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Denying the teary-eyed girl's requests, he continued to have fun with the girl's modest chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhh, this is getting really fun…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki had a nagging feeling at the back of his mind that he was doing something he shouldn't be, he ignored it and kept going. The girl beneath him had gotten red from ear to ear and was still trying her best to keep her mouth shut. However, she soon reached her limit, and spoke up again with a shaky voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-senp-Please… forgive, Yuika…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. I'm starting to feel pity for you. Then this will be the last."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fueh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He pulled his hands off of her chest, brought his face closer to hers, and softly kissed the nape of her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's body twitched as she let out a loud shriek. Like that, she rolled over to the side of the bed and stopped moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She lost consciousness, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe the impact of that was a bit too much for Yuika, since her body was already burning up from the alcohol.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I feel really refreshed for some reason!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That reaction of Yuika as she was fondled like that was so cute that all the anger inside Keiki had disappeared. Keiki's brain was so fluffy right now that he felt like he could do anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kukuku… Then how about we also give the others a taste of their own medicine? If I were to give them some embarrassing memories like Yuika-chan here, they might finally stop their toying with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The magic put into Keiki by the whisky chocolate was far from disappearing. He was blurting out things that he would normally never dream of saying out loud. If he wanted to fondle a girls' breasts, then he would no hold back. This right here was a person whose limits were broken by the power of alcohol.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in that moment, the door to the room slowly opened, and Sayuki walked into the room, with one hand on her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uuu… For some reason, my head really hurts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey there, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya?! …K-Keiki-kun? Why are you in my room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun is perfectly fine wherever he is. -Just like the moon in the starry sky!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're talking about."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she was able to give a dry response like that, the girl's drunkenness had apparently worn off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like Sayuki-senpai is back to normal, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. When I woke up, I was collapsed in the hallway… It feels like I did something really horrible before I collapsed, but I can't remember a single bit of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked as if she were concentrating really hard to try to remember, but she soon gave up and walked towards the sleeping Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Koga-san fell asleep, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. She fell asleep a bit before Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you do something to her…? D-Don't tell me, is that it? You did all sorts of perverted things that you can never tell to anybody? …Ah, no that can't be the case. If Keiki-kun wanted to do that, then he would have already-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did. Things that are so perverted that I wouldn't be able to say them aloud."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And… Next, it's Sayuki-senpai's turn."</p>
<p class="null-p">He grabbed the shocked Sayuki's shoulders and pushed her down sideways onto her bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki… kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably realized that her Kouhai's attitude was different from usual. Her eyes, filled with unease and uncertainty, looked straight up at the boy pushing her down. Reflected in Keiki's eyes was the indescribable beauty Sayuki. Long, black hair, white skin, perfect proportions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki-senpai really is beautiful no matter how you look at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she was inspected at this distance, the girl's cheeks' colour changed into a faint red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking about it, Sayuki-senpai really played with my heart a lot of times. Dropping the key to your handcuffs into your chest, wearing no panties on our date, wearing my underwear…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really did some indecent things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Sayuki-senpai's biggest sin lies somewhere else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Biggest sin?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those breasts of yours! Every single day, they try to lead me astray! Because you boast about them at every single opportunity, the other club members always glare at me with cold eyes, you know?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just because Keiki-kun keeps looking at them, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no room for complaints! You will keep quiet and accept my punishment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What do you plan on doing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see… That reminds me, the two of us kissed on the night of the festival, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fueh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's body shook when she was reminded of that incident.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… Uuh… T-That's right. That… might have happened, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you have any experience with kissing before me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No… is that bad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then this will be Senpai's second time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without giving her any room to struggle, Keiki pressed his lips against Sayuki's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's eyes opened wide at this unexpected development. Of course, she tried to resist as best as she could, but Keiki didn't give her any openings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu… Nnn… Nnn?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their kiss continued, with short breaks in between for them to catch their breath, but not enough for Sayuki to get a word out edgewise. Like this, the girl's world started spinning in front of her. The strength in her arms, which had previously been trying to push Keiki away, slowly disappeared, and her resistance stopped altogether.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hauuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, Sayuki's body went limp as she lay on the bed. The sweat on the nape of her neck looked so enticing. Keiki let out a pleased giggle from seeing his senpai in that state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kukuku… Punishment done."</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the girl alone on the bed, he got up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, the last one is Nanjou. She constantly uses me as a model for her BL manga and forces me into embarrassing poses in front of my little sister. She's always going on and on about having my ass stuffed with rod-shaped genitalia inside the manga, so how about we make her experience that in real life?" The drunkyard said those words, sounding very pleased at the thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">And nobody was here to stop this animal from his plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….H-Huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, as soon as he was about to open the door and enter this new world, his view got blurry and his legs lost their strength. Unable to keep himself up, he collapsed onto the floor right then and there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki came back to his senses, he was still lying on the cold floor. Pushing his body upright, he saw Sayuki and Yuika sleeping on their beds and he realized that he was near the doorway to their room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why did I fall asleep here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The room was dark. He tilted his head upwards to look at the time, and it was a bit past midnight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone ate chocolate together… and then… Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't recall what had happened after that. Nor even why he was sleeping inside the girls' room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nnn… Keiki-kuuun… Anymore than this is… Nooo…" Sayuki mumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of dream is that person having, really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki guessed that it was probably one of her masochistic-scenariofilled dreams, so he didn't dwell too long on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuugh… My head hurts… I guess I'll go get some fresh air."</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the room, he walked down the stairs and went out on the deck connected to the living room. What greeted him was the cool, soothing breeze of the nearby sea, and the beautiful moonlit sky, which was filled with countless stars.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now this makes this trip worth it for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a night sky you certainly wouldn't be able to enjoy in the big city. Although everyone was born into the same world, the things they could see were completely different. It was something completely normal, yet Keiki never had been aware of it to this extent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah? Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around towards the source of that voice, he saw a reddishbrown haired girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, you're here too, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I woke up a while ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing a shirt and shorts. She walked up next to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For some reason, I don't have any memories from after we started eating the chocolate. When I came to, I was lying on my bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence. I don't have any either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… But, it feels like I'm better off not remembering at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, I kinda agree with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like the both of them felt like they would spend their days happier if they didn't remember. They both mutually decided to not bring up the subject any more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I didn't ever think that we could be go on a trip like this with the calligraphy club," Mao commented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"True."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the club prez is the only one who really even works on calligraphy anyway. I'm just drawing manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, how's it going with your shoujo manga?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It could be better, I guess? I managed to finish the roughs during summer vacation, and I've gotten the OK. Right now, I'm working on the manuscript for the final release."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that's amazing! If it gets featured in a magazine, I'll buy it." "You're a bit too fast on that, chief. It might even end up as a nonserialized story."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure it'll still be amazing, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm getting embarrassed, so stop it would you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After all that had happened, Keiki still really thought that having a manga of yours released in a magazine was something amazing for a high school student. "…Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, for what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I'm thankful to Kiryuu. It's all thanks to Kiryuu that I managed to get here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I only help you out with your research, though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but it's also all because it was you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I wonder?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl let out a childish giggle, and her hair fluttered as she turned around to face Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen. This is just a what-if scenario, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What would you think if I stopped being a fujoshi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I stopped drawing erotic BL manga, and become just a normal girl, would you-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Bringing her hands in front of her chest like she was praying, she let the following words out, filled with conviction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you… Fall in love with me?"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_04_17.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Now, what kind of meaning did her words actually hold?</p>
<p class="null-p">On the night of the training camp, beneath the starry sky, the two of them were standing on the porch. In the midst of this romantic atmosphere, Keiki couldn't help but see these words as a 'Confession of Love'. But remembering all his experiences, he immediately stopped thinking that way. He was sure that there couldn't be many girls that would hold the same level of affection towards him as Mizuha. A manga-like scenario like being approached by countless girls wouldn't be possible in reality. That means that he had to not think of this as a confession at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… If that were the case, I could stop being your model, and we might become even closer as friends, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I really didn't mean it like that, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao sighed in defeat, and muttered a disheartened "I really worked hard, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what did you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to that question, the girl pouted. And while hitting Keiki in the chest with her fist-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just figure that out on your own, you idiot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sticking out her tongue, she went back inside the residence. The boy was left behind and could only see her off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What was that about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't know how many times this had thought this, but he apparently was still unable to understand a girl's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And even if she tells me to think about it on my own, I have no clue… I mean, 'Would you fall in love with me' really sounded like-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like she wanted Keiki to fall in love with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There's no way, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He quickly dismissed that possibility that was trying to make its way into his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if Nanjou or the other girls from the calligraphy club were to become normal girls…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Senpai he looked up to, the honestly cute Kouhai, the close classmate, or the considerate little sister… If they were to become normal girls, and rid themselves of their fetishes-</p>
<p class="null-p">Would I be able to fall in love with one of them…?</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki gave up on that possibility. After all, he couldn't imagine that those girls could actually be cured.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I'll go back to my room and sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the fresh air, the headache he previously had was gone. After taking a final glance at the sea, Keiki left the porch behind him, all the while reminiscing about the girls playing volleyball on the sandy beach.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nnn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was in the middle of the night, about 2am. Keiki woke up upon hearing some kind of creaking sound next to him. Inside the dimly moonlit room, Keiki could tell that the ceiling he was looking up at was not his own. Of course, he was still inside the private residence that the Ootori household owned. He once more heard that creaking sound, followed by a soft and heavy feeling on his stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What greeted him was his little sister, wearing a white shirt. With an expression overflowing with emotion, she looked up at her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the girl wouldn't respond this question, and simply put her finger on a button of her shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">One.</p>
<p class="null-p">A second.</p>
<p class="null-p">With these two buttons undone, Keiki could start seeing the valley of Mizuha's breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mizuha-san?! What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I… can't hold back any longer…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seeing Nii-san be close to other girls like that… my chest was hurting the entire time."</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened up yet another button. But the underwear that she should be wearing never came into view. At this point in time, Keiki realized that she probably wasn't wearing any underwear at all. And, finally-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I never planned on entering the calligraphy club. After all, I would be forced to see Nii-san be friendly with other girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because I don't want to let Nii-san be taken by anyone else."</p>
<p class="null-p">When the fourth button opened, her belly entered into view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I love Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting her intense feelings into words, the final button flew upon, and the girl finally took off the shirt, with no hesitation whatsoever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What Keiki now saw was the girl's appearance, completely naked, without underwear. Her body illuminated by the moonlight was so beautiful that Keiki thought for a moment that a goddess was standing in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Look! Hey, Nii-san! Look at me! Only me, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body, no longer hidden by a single thread, twirled around. Of course, this move showed various parts of her wonderful body, and Keiki could feel the blood running down from his nose already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey… this isn't a joke, okay…!" He said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why? We're not real siblings after all, so there's no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">Responding calmly like that, the girl thrust herself against her older brother and hugged him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was being hugged by a completely naked girl. Of course, he could directly feel the soft feeling of her body. Naturally, for a virgin like Keiki, who greatly lacked experience in this regard, the impact was way too stimulating. Keiki's son was announcing his presence in his lower half, and he was trying his hardest to calm it down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">While at this distance where they could feel each other's breath, the girl softly called out to her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl entered a boy's room at this hour, getting completely naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki knew very well what this girl was expecting by doing this. And he knew very well that Kiryuu Mizuha was a very appealing girl. She was beautiful, kind, and her breasts were just the size that Keiki liked. A normal boy would give in here. Keiki himself even thought, "Isn't it fine to just keep going with the flow here?" but the last piece of his rational thinking stopped him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, Mizuha…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though we're not related, I still see us as siblings, and we're not going out. This is something you should only do with a lover, so let's-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha stopped Keiki mid-sentence. And bringing her mouth closer to his ear, she whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's have… sex."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuwaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This single sentence had a stronger impact on him than any question Keiki had ever heard before. Keiki's rational thinking was obliterated in a single instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">This isn't good?! My son is totally raring to go…?!</p>
<p class="null-p">After finding out that they weren't blood related, Keiki couldn't help but see Mizuha as a normal girl. After being hugged like this by a member of the opposite sex and having this soft invitation whispered into his ear, it was impossible for him to not start getting into the mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was that he couldn't escape the situation fast enough. At this distance, there was no way that Mizuha wouldn't realize what was going on in his lower half. If his cute little sister told him "Niisan, you went hard, right?" now with a grin on her face, Keiki's reason and last line of defence would be shattered for sure. He had no confidence that he would be able to hold back. At this rate, his first time would really be with his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Mizuha! I-!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why he rallied his resolve and was about to try to solve the situation in the last second-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Zzzz… Zzzz…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Ah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Keiki realized that the only sounds Mizuha was making were the sounds of soft breathing, like she was asleep. She had an expression like an angel as her body lay against her older brother's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that she'd be able to fall asleep in a situation like this… And there's a faint smell of alcohol…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that Keiki thought about it, she had also eaten some of the whisky chocolate. That was probably why she fell asleep with this kind of timing. Or maybe it was the whole reason why she even came into his room like this in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Whatever the reason, I guess I'm saved for now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With his prior tension completely extinguished, Keiki let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'It hurts my chest to see Nii-san be close to other girls,' huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So this was the reason why the girl's smile seemed off back when they were all present in the living room. She saw Keiki being friendly with the other girls during the camping trip, and jealousy was burning inside her chest. Maybe those actions of hers, like showing him her bra in the clubroom, or flipping up her skirt, were just ways for her to get Keiki's attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I think about that… Mizuha keeps looking more and more cute to me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He softly stroked the sleeping girl's head. Though it would be troublesome to be approached like this more than once, he didn't feel bad that she was openly showing her feelings towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, what do I do with this girl…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He certainly couldn't leave the butt-naked girl as she was. First, he had to put some clothes on her, and then he had to get her out of the room. After all, if they were to be seen like this, the situation-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">-Would be extremely bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was probably because he was too busy focusing on the girl in his arms. The door to the room had opened, and two girls were standing in the door frame calling out to him. Their identities were Sayuki and Yuika. Their expressions were dark, and their gazes cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No wonder he wouldn't be swayed by either of us. Keiki-kun was only living for his little sister after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika knew that he was a siscon, but not to this extent…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, wait?! You're wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what might we be wrong about? An older brother holding his completely naked little sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki lowered her gaze, towards his naked little sister, who was still in his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you did all those things to Yuika before? You're the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What things?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-As if Yuika could just say it out loud!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it looked like she was trying not to recall it, since her face turned bright red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun also did this and that to me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly is 'this' and 'that?!'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-As if I could say!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What in the world did I do?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Yuika's lead, Sayuki's face went red as she glared at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Calm down… Let's calmly analyze the situation…</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, it was deep in the night. And, he was currently inside a bedroom of the Ootori household's private residence. What was he doing right now? He was sitting on top of his bed, tightly hugging his naked little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Aren't I completely done for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation completely unacceptable. Especially the naked little sister part. It wasn't hard to arrive at the kind of misunderstanding the two girls were having. When Keiki realized that he wouldn't be able to talk himself out of his current situation, he felt a trickle of cold sweat run down his back. What was about to begin was a trial, and he had no defence lawyer on his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the judges both took a step forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope that you can give us a good explanation, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-h2">To be continue...</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">*This afterword may contain spoilers for the main story so please be aware of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">This has been the 4th installment of "Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?" This time, it was all about Mizuha, huh? Since she didn't have much screen time up until now, I went all out here. The cover in itself is highly appealing, and the colour pages that follow it have perfect erotic illustrations, which really fits the exibitionistic theme of the little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Concerning the contents, Mizuha quickly changed from an oasis to another pervert. Well, some people might have already guessed it, since there was a pair of panties together with the love letter. Even more so when you take the title of the series into consideration. Making her older brother choose underwear for her, cooking food while wearing a naked apron… There were hints everywhere, but I'll have Keiki-kun work just as hard from now on to make him survive.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, I really like this 'hidden big breasts' principle of Mizuha. The feeling of finding treasure after not expecting all too much. Not to mention that seeing a calm girl like her take off her clothing in this fashion can be even called a man's romance. (Subjective opinion)</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, sune-sensei, your drawings of Mizuha are too cute. Seeing the form of her breasts, as well as the valley of the same, I couldn't stop myself from staring at them. Thank you very much for amazing breasts this time around as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">With this 4th installment of 'Hensuki', we've crossed the one-year milestone. And I'm only able to keep writing like this because of all the people who have continued to pick up this series. Really, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Recently, hugging pillow covers and several other goods have started production as well. Not to mention the comicalization, which is in the Monthly's Dragon Age, so please give it a try if you like the series.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the identity of Cinderella has been revealed, as well as her fetish, the story will start a new chapter in the next volume. We've even got a new character already introduced, so I hope you look forward to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Here's hoping that we may see each other again in the next volume.</p>
