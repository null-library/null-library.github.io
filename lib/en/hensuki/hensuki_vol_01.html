<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I believe that we are spending a time that we will never be able to experience again. Especially after school, where we normally should be enjoying our blooming youth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, so why are we spending that time cleaning a room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because you left everything lying around."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being given the straight truth, the female student that the boy called Senpai turned her face away with a displeased expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl has long black hair, which leaves an impression on everyone that sees her. Her name is Tokihara Sayuki. She is a 3rd year and club president of the calligraphy club that Kiryuu Keiki is a member of. Adding to her beautiful hair and great style, she has two big melon-like breasts that really strech her uniform to it's limits. This long-haired big-breasted beauty was currently holding a mop and a wet cloth. Contrasting her beauty with these dirty cleaning materials was a weird scene to behold for sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A civilization where cleaning is necessary should just go to ruin."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the very least, the public order of this room is collapsing that's for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stopped cleaning with his wet cloth and looked around said room. The calligraphy club room was in huge disarray for one apparent reason. This reason was the countless scattered (already used) papers. Normally, you could see that most of the flooring consisted of tatami mats, but right now you could barely see the floor at all. What made things worse was the huge amount of ink splashed on the walls, windows and even on the ceiling, making this room look like a scene from hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, after a teacher saw this mess, there's no wonder that we would be lectured on that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">This happened during today's lunch break. The state of the room was seen and Sayuki was called to the teacher's office, where she was lectured and told to clean the room. She then proceeded to call Keiki here via phone to help her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now Senpai, if we don't finish this up today we'll be scolded by Sensei again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And why exactly is Keiki-kun so motivated?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why isn't Senpai as motivated as I am? This is your room, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"---That's right, Tokihara-senpai. Let's hurry up and finish this, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person that chimed in to support Keiki was another female student that had the complete opposite body structure of Sayuki. Her golden-colored hair didn't quite reach down to her delicate shoulders. This girl with gem-like blue eyes was the first-year Koga Yuika. Her appearance looked more like a foreigner but her name clearly suggested Japanese roots. In her hands were bundles of paper, signifying that she was indeed helping with the cleaning work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Yuika-chan, that you had to help out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, Yuika didn't have any library work today."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was currently responsible for cleaning the tatami mats. Since a lot of papers had gotten between them, it resulted in a lot of work for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Yuika-chan saved us by coming here. To think that a first-year kouhai would be working harder than her senpai… how does that make you feel Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to say it that way……fine, I'll work seriously now." Sayuki said with pouting lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then turned around to look at her kouhai with an expression like she wanted to start a fight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, was there really a reason to call Koga-san for help? This is the calligraphy club's problem, basically me and Keiki-kun's problem after all, so there's no need to involve yourself into his."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's words were clearly meant as declaration of hostility. However, without loosing her cool, the kouhai responded in a calm manner. "Keiki-senpai is Yuika's Senpai after all. As his Kouhai, she can't just overlook the fact that he is being tyrannized by a witch like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, another war between the two was about to ensue…</p>
<p class="null-p">Why is it that things always end up like this whenever the two of them meet?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like water and oil, they really aren't compatible in the least.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's not like I really mind but can we just finish this and go home already?" Another voice. It was as cold as ice.</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who said that, named Nanjou Mao, had bright red hair with a side-tail and was currently wearing flashy clothes. She was Keiki's classmate and a good female friend of his. Currently, she was scrubbing the ink that was on the wall, and it seemed like she wanted to remind the other members of the cleaning operation that they should resume their work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's right. This isn't the time to be fighting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Yuika is sorry, Mao-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them stopped glaring at each other and started returning to the cleaning work. Mao followed suit and started scrubbing the wall again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This really sucks. Why do I have to help here as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seems like Nanjou is in a bad mood today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I'd be. Even though I'm not a member of this club, I still have to help clean it up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that big of a deal. By helping here, you can clear up your debt after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That reminds me, there was one time when I had Kiryuu take my place when it was my turn to clean the classroom……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't know why but he had volunteered to take her place that time. He had used that debt to call her here, asking her for help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I will at least do the same work that Kiryuu did for me that time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'd appreciate it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the walls to Mao, Keiki returned to his own working space. In that moment, Sayuki let out another sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I wonder when all this cleaning will be over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I called someone else here to help, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someone else?" At the same time Sayuki tilted her head, a knocking sound came from the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, perfect timing. Come in!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me…uwa, this is worse than I thought." The female student stated as she looked around the room. Her short black hair was her most prominent feature. This girl was Keiki's little sister, Kiryuu Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, by someone else, you meant your sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello. I heard from Nii-san that things were pretty bad here, so I decided to help out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha's cleaning skill is on a completely different than Senpai's so she'll surely be of great help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for not having a decent cleaning skill……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without paying any attention to Sayuki, Mizuha walked towards her big brother, grabbing his sleeves.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, Nii-san, my whole body is telling me to start cleaning immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good good. Seems like your cleaning blood is boiling."</p>
<p class="null-p">For someone who hated dirty places, this was a true battlefield. With fast movements, she took a broom. Seeing his little sister's attitude, Keiki nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, since everyone is here, let's get this over with!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, the five of them began their big cleaning operation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving out the details, their battle against the room took about one hour.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's finally over…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was a lot of work alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say it like you weren't the one responsible for this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having gathered all the papers into one big mountain, they cleaned the ink from both the walls and the ceiling. In the end, they even did some maintenance on their tools too, so now they were being assaulted by a feeling of exhaustion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You too, Mizuha. You really saved us. Thanks," Keiki said as he pat his sister on the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…yeah. No problem," She seemed to be embarrassed a bit and her cheeks were slightly flushed as she closed her eyes like a cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao looked at the scene in front of her with cold eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I thought so before but Kiryuu seems to be quite the siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Big brothers are supposed to spoil their little sisters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine if you're so close…Rather than that, I really want to go home and take a bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Yuika too." The blond-haired kouhai agreed to Mao's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because they were cleaning that whole time, all of their clothes had ink stains all over them. Although that wasn't exactly weird or anything, Keiki let out a small giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I just thought it was funny. All of us cleaning so much that we even got dirty in the process, doesn't this somehow feel like youth as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Keiki's words, the other four girls exchanged glances. And after that, all of them showed a charming smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. Then, everyone can go home now. I'll put away the rest." He had a blue bucket in his hands, filled with the dirty water used for the cleaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I can do that." Maybe because out of guilt, Sayuki raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, I'll handle that so please go home, Sayuki-senpai. Senpai had to finish her work for the competition yesterday right? You really worked hard without sleeping for a single minute, I assume. You even have bags under your eyes, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No I don't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really do. Why would you lie about that?" Under her eyes, the proof of her sleep-deprived state was clearly there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't help it then. You really convinced me with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Recently, Sayuki was working on a project that she would enter into a competition. Not having the time to worry about cleaning, the room two hours prior was the result of that. Keiki was well aware of the fact that she was a helplessly hard worker. That's why, as her Kouhai, he wanted to help her at least with something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, just go home and take a rest. I'll finish things up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really not that tired though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No good. Just this once, I will have you listen to my words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I got it already…" After being told a bit more forcefully, the Senpai finally gave in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, should I wait for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you don't have to. You probably want to take a shower too, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Maybe…I do." Looking down at her own body, she fiddled with her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the clean-fanatic Mizuha, being covered with ink must be rough. Just like Mao and the others, she probably wanted to hurry home and wash herself off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright then Sayuki-senpai, how about you give us some final words as the club president?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, thank you very much for today. I'll call for you if I ever need the room cleaned again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'd really like you to take it easy on us in that regard…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was about 5pm in the afternoon. Around that time, everyone went their own way. Being left by the girls, Keiki left the room to clean out the bucket. His destination was the boy's toilet on the same floor. Having arrived, he then started washing it off in the sink. The voices of the sports clubs and the other students blended together into a sort of nice background music.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was simple work and it didn't take too long. Even the stained-black cloth that they had used was clean very fast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mhm?" Thinking that he had heard a voice, he raised his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Doing that, he saw a happy-go-lucky couple walking with crossed arms by the window beneath him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fucking normies, go explode already…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of blessing the happy couple, he instead cursed them with his loner feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……I want a girlfriend too……"</p>
<p class="null-p">If only it wasn't so difficult. He had never received a love letter since he was born and it didn't seem like he'd be receiving one anytime soon. He didn't even get valentine's chocolate from anyone other than his little sister. No matter how much one wanted to experience love, there was no way if you didn't have a partner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling depressed because of this sad reality, he grit is teeth as he put the cleaning tools back where they belonged. Having finished everything, he once more walked towards the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, no one was present any more and only the evening sun shone through the curtains. Keiki then proceeded to pick up his bag from the chair. A pleasant breeze came in through the opened windows, slightly pushing up the curtains.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he went to close the windows, he realized it. On top of a table, there was a pink envelope. As a substitute for a paperweight, a white handkerchief was used to keep it in place. At first, he thought that someone had forgotten it, but that turned out to be a wrong assumption. Written on the envelope was [For Kiryuu Keiki-sama].</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's addressed to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Some kind of message probably. But, is it really necessary to write a letter for that?</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much he looked at the front or back of the envelope, he couldn't get any more information out of it. Having no other choice but to check directly, he opened it up and took the paper out. It was mostly blank but there was one phrase written in the middle of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">With girly handwriting, it said [I like you.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't tell me……a love letter?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No way that he would misunderstand that. Realizing that it was a real love letter, his cheeks got hot. Whether that was out of happiness or embarrassment, he did not know. Since this was the first time that he had been told such words, he couldn't hold back his excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?! So it's finally my turn?! After all this time, my days without a girlfriend are finally over?! A-Alriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight!!!" A scream that shook the whole room. It was the scream of a delighted boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, crap."</p>
<p class="null-p">Out of excitement, he happened to drop the letter and the handkerchief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Landing softly on the ground, said handkerchief opened up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that one moment, Keiki couldn't believe his eyes. Wanting to make sure that he wasn't seeing things, he picked it up and inspected it. He realized that it didn't have four corners like a normal handkerchief would. Instead, it had three corners.</p>
<p class="null-p">So his eyes really weren't playing any tricks on him. What he thought of as a normal handkerchief was in fact the underwear of a female.</p>
<p class="null-p">Panties with a very cute design.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was an adolescent boy. The sweet, passionate love story that he thought was waiting for him turned out to be a cold-hearted lie. Indeed, this must've been the most unusual start of a romance there ever was. To begin with, adding the girl's panties to the love letter was weird. And, no matter where he looked, he did not find the name of the girl.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: Cinderella Forgot To Take Her Panties With Her</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, there was a love letter waiting for you on the table when you returned to the room."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a voice that fit his beautiful face, the good-looking, jersey-wearing male student summarized Keiki's explanation. This student's name was Akiyama Shouma, and just like Keiki, he was in class 2-B. As the ace of the tennis club, he was indeed quite popular with the girls. Little did they know that he was only interested in girls of a certain age range. To be more specific, he was a lolicon.</p>
<p class="null-p">This handsome man and Keiki were friends. Currently, they were having a meeting in the tennis club's clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And here I thought that you came here for morning practice. You really were just making me listen to your boasting again, weren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do feel bad that I had to interrupt your training."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind. I'm happy that you came to talk to me about it," Shouma said as he showed Keiki a smile. "So you finally received a love letter, I see… although the girl added a pair of panties to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I was really surprised, too," Keiki took out said pair of pure white panties, and Shouma responded with a small gasp of surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, that's really brave of you to bring those back to school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like I could just leave them at home…" After all, that pair of panties was Keiki's only clue to finding the sender of the love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just out of curiosity… are they used?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it seems like they're completely new. They don't even smell like laundry detergent or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you actually smelled them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if they really were used, I'd wash them just in case." It's better safe than sorry, after all. "Hey, Shouma. What do you think these panties mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe the person who sent you the love letter panicked and just happened to drop them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How much would you have to panic in order to just 'happen' to drop your panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Believe it or not, people make the craziest mistakes when they panic. No matter how unbelievable it sounds, there might be an actual reason why something like that could happen on accident.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, why didn't the girl write her name on the letter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Exactly. This was the main part that Keiki was struggling with. There was no name anywhere on the love letter he had received. Everything else was already weird enough, but that was the most confusing part of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really is a mystery, yeah. I doubt that she simply forgot to write it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or could this whole thing just be some elaborate prank?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be true as well. Still, I don't think that there are many students who would play pranks like this. We are in high school, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're probably right about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, the two of them couldn't come up with anything. Just the panties alone were a complete mystery. Not to mention the girl's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, just thinking about it won't help. How about we call the girl</p>
<p class="null-p">'Cinderella' for now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why 'Cinderella?'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Instead of her shoe, she dropped her panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of reason is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki could see why Shouma had thought of that. Him not knowing the girl's name was very much like how the prince of the story didn't know Cinderella's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, name and panties aside, the best place to start would be trying to figure out who could have actually been able to leave the letter in that location."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the thing. But… you know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I've been thinking about that constantly ever since I found the letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">After everyone had left that day, Keiki was in the room the entire time, except for ten short minutes when he had left to clean the bucket. With that in mind, the number of possible culprits was very small indeed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, there's probably not many people it could have been," Shouma seemed to agree with Keiki's reasoning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not assuming that it can't be someone from outside the club but… No one except for the girls present at that time should've known that I was staying behind. So just leaving the letter in the calligraphy club like that would be too risky, I think. The logical conclusion is that Cinderella was there yesterday when we are all cleaning up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming to agree with Keiki's line of thinking, Shouma asked, "And who was there when you were cleaning the room again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There were--"</p>
<p class="null-p">The big-breasted Senpai, Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">The honest and cute Kouhai, Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">His close classmate, Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's little sister, Kiryuu Mizuha.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_6.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Leaving out Mizuha-chan because she's your little sister, that leaves you with three girls. One of them should be the Cinderella that wrote you the love letter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-So you think so as well." "You're face is getting red, Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, you know…" Keiki fidgeted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not squirm around with a red face like that? It's frightening."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I can't help it, right? This is the first time I've gotten a love letter, after all……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the minor detail about the panties isn't important to you at all, it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave me alone, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Keiki, the fact that he had gotten a chance to get a girlfriend was more important now. Also, all of the possible candidates were people he knew. All of them were women with plenty of charm. His face continued turning red with the thought that one of them held romantic feelings toward him. "So currently, you have the panties of one of those three girls." "That's putting it too bluntly, so can you please keep that off-record?" It ruins that sweet feeling from before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you're right. In the end, it comes down to me finding out who these panties belong to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't act like the prince from the Cinderella story did. It's easy to ask girls to try on shoes to see if they fit. Panties are a different matter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sounds like you're having fun, watching me struggle…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then do you want to give up? You can also choose to not search for your Cinderella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'll do it! I definitely will!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well at least you're not lacking in motivation. Where'd that change come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, that should be obvious," Standing up, Keiki struck a do-or-die pose with one hand in the air and exclaimed, "Even I want to have a cute girlfriend!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the one phrase that probably every adolescent boy had thought to themselves at least once.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to be all lovey-dovey with a cute girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, this was one of the primal wishes of a young boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the girl's identity was unknown, the feelings she had for Keiki were as clear as day. To put it simply, finding out her identity would result in getting a lover. It's as simple as that, Keiki thought. Of course, it was a rather straightforward conclusion, but that was more than enough for a lonely virgin like him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl that wrote the love letter was the Cinderella who dropped her panties. Steeling his resolve, the prince lifted the curtains on his weird search for Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having separated from Shouma, Keiki was on the way to his classroom when he ran into Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, good morning Cake-kun. Your name sounds as delicious as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Sayuki-senpai. My name isn't Cake, you know? It's Ke-iki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The pronunciation is almost exactly the same, isn't it? You won't ever be popular if you sweat tiny little details like that, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it too early for you to be insulting me like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For example, think about when there's a delicious cake for your birthday or something. You're the kind of person who'd be disappointed if his slice were even a tiny bit smaller than everybody else's."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I'm more disappointed by what you're saying this early in the morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice comeback, Keiki-kun," She said with a giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a pen she took out of nowhere, she scribbled something on Keiki's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not just draw graffiti on my cheek like that? …And what did you even write?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wrote 'Officer, it was me.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly did I do?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki took out a small hand-mirror and let Keiki have a look. It was just a childish prank, but she still looked like she was having fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">She might've seemed like a weird person, but Keiki didn't dislike being pranked by her. On the contrary, he rather enjoyed it. No boy would ever claim to dislike being close friends with a beautiful senpai like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, our cleaning operation yesterday was a lot of work, wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was only a lot of work because of Senpai, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm reflecting on that. I don't regret it, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, you really learn everything the hard way, don't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's Keiki-kun's responsibility to look after the room, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me? Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you're such a cleaning fanatic, you didn't come to the club for a whole week, so of course the room would end up like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the first I've heard of that. It's true that it's mostly me who cleans up the room, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, Kiryuu Keiki wasn't exactly a full-fledged member of the calligraphy club. Although he was registered as a member, he was a real amateur when it came to calligraphy. He neither went to the club room on a regular basis nor actually practised writing. You might even go so far as to call him a ghost member of the club. The only reason that he got involved with the calligraphy club in the first place was because he was charmed by Sayuki. Rather than calling it affection, it was more like he looked up to her. While she was writing, she looked really cool. So cool that he would almost forget every unfortunate aspect about her. Of course, her being an interesting person to be around was also a big part of that. The day he first met her, he wasn't nervous like a normal boy his age would be around such a beauty. Instead, she seemed childish to him, and he could be more intimate with her than with other girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But wasn't it Senpai who told me 'I want to focus for a bit, so could you leave me alone?'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Did I really say something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, you did. Do you not remember that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do remember having lots of work to do and being annoyed about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine……Ah, here. The key to the room."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday after school, he had borrowed that key from Sayuki. Her expression was the same as always. When their hands touched, there was no reaction at all. Keiki saw no difference from her usual behaviour. Would she really be able to calmly interact with Keiki if she was his Cinderella?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh?" Seemingly catching on to something, Sayuki came closer to Keiki's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, you have bags under your eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way that that's the case," He answered as naturally as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course it's the case. Why would you tell such a blatantly obvious lie? …</p>
<p class="null-p">Did you not sleep well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, uhm… I couldn't fall asleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was too busy thinking about the identity of Cinderella, which made it impossible for him to calm down enough to fall asleep. It was his first love letter, after all, so there was no way he could remain calm about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about you go to the clubroom and take a nap?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds really tempting, but I can't just skip classes like that, so I'll have to pass."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a shame. I was even planning on taking a nap together with you," She let out a teasing laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her cute smile, Keiki was entranced for a moment and found himself staring at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, it's nothing. I'll excuse myself now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that it would be a good idea to erase that writing off your face. It makes you look like an idiot, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai was the one who wrote that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had completely forgotten the writing on his cheeks. He was about to wipe it away with his sleeve, but Sayuki took out a handkerchief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, hold still."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Okay." Being so close to her face, Keiki felt the blood rushing to his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There, it's gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Thank you very much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I still don't know if Tokihara Sayuki really is my Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, his heart throbbed at the possibility.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was lunch break and Keiki was currently in the library. He was sitting behind the counter, surrounded by countless books and computer workstations. Next to him was the short-haired blonde girl who was currently on duty as a librarian.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for yesterday. Yuika-chan really helped us out a whole lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is glad that she was able to help."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday after classes, he had run into her in the hallway after he was called over by Sayuki. After telling Yuika the circumstances, she offered to help clean the clubroom. Since Keiki and Yuika were often together at committee meetings, they were pretty close to each other. His impression of this girl Koga Yuika was that she was an honestly cute kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, someone is ready to check out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Yuika will do it," she said as she turned towards the girl that came in with a book.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moving the mouse with her small hands, she scanned the book and handed it back to the female student. "Here you go. The deadline for returning it is two weeks from now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perfectly polite customer service with a smile until the end. Even though she had only been working at the library for about one month, she performed her job flawlessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You look like you're having fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika really likes books, after all. Even though she doesn't look the part,</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika actually is a real bookworm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A bookworm, huh? Do you read any books from overseas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not all that many, no. Yuika might look foreign because of her blonde hair, but her English isn't very good."</p>
<p class="null-p">After adding "I don't read anything unless it's translated into Japanese," she let out a laugh. Although she looked a bit like a foreign princess, Keiki always found her very easy to talk to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I recall correctly, your grandma was from England, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Yuika's grandmother's daughter is Yuika's mother and her father is fully Japanese. That makes Yuika a quarter British, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were always talking like this when they were on duty together. Since they were in the library, though, they had to keep their voices down a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai lives alone with his little sister, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, since both of our parents work so much, they aren't home all that often."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika's parents also come home fairly late. When she was a kid - before her grandmother passed away - Yuika was often at her house. She had a lot of books there that she would read to me…" Reminiscing about the past like that, she looked at the books on the counter. "It's Yuika's dream to write children's picture books."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that sounds really cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">He imagined a grown-up Yuika drawing picture books, and he thought that it really suited her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does Senpai like big breasts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cough?! E-Excuse me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, keep your voice down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry……that was because you said something so weird out of the blue," Keiki protested, this time in a quieter voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, does Senpai like big breasts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? We're continuing that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wants to use it as a reference."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of reference would that be…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what's your answer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No comment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That tells me everything Yuika needs to know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why are you even asking me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, there was no way out of the situation for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wonders why all boys like big breasts," She said, casting a sidelong glance at said boy sitting next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being cornered by his kouhai, Keiki felt cold sweat forming on his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is sure that Keiki-senpai is gradually becoming ensnared by</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara-senpai's breasts. How lewd…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? You came running to her aid just because of one phone call, after all. You're basically acting as her yes-man at this point. Didn't you enter the calligraphy club just because of her breasts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not because of that. You're definitely wrong about that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He certainly didn't join the calligraphy club because of such a half-baked reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And why can't you just get along with Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big breasts are the enemy of every flat-chested girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why does this sound so convincing coming from you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thinks that it's cheating for Tokihara-senpai to both be beautiful and also have big breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really have to agree on that," Nodding in agreement, he suddenly realized that a cold stare was coming from his side. "…So you really do like them on the bigger side." "Ah…" He realized too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the more he tried to talk his way out of it, the colder the gaze of his cute kouhai became.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good. At this rate, my status as a trustworthy senpai will……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You never had such a status from the beginning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's Senpai's fault for comparing breast sizes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't mean to compare anything, but it's true that he liked them on the larger end of the scale. Seeing his kouhai hang her head down in defeat, a sudden feeling of torture assaulted Keiki. As he shrank down with his whole body like a dog getting scolded, Yuika raised her voice once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Senpai. There's no need to be so depressed about it. Yuika was joking after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, joking?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, Yuika just wanted to tease you a little bit. That's why you don't have to feel bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa… T-Thank God."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. But, seeing Senpai react like that, he looked really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't tease me just for that reason…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing his reaction, his kouhai started snickering.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her laughing face was unbearably cute, and seeing her small body slightly shake in laughter, he felt the urge to just hug her right on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, a sweet, mesmerizing voice started whispering to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Senpai. Did you know?" Her lips looked so sweet and soft. "Girls, you see. They don't tease boys that they don't have any interest in." That phrase reverberated inside Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-What exactly do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I wonder…?" She chuckled. He wondered how much of that she meant as a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">The blonde-haired girl kept everything a secret as she showed a beautiful smile to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, lunch break is just about over. Let's prepare to close up the library."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, yeah," As he said that, Keiki thought to himself, Maybe Yuika is actually Cinderella, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a beautiful girl with foreign charm and a natural, honest cuteness. If she were to become his lover, he probably wouldn't need anything else in life. To think that an angel-like presence like her could be in love with him- Thinking that, just like the time with Sayuki, his heart started pounding in his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Later that day, Keiki was in P.E, his last class for the day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since boys and girls were split up into separate groups, the boys were having a match of basketball while the girls were playing volleyball. Keiki and Shouma were sitting against they wall as they watched their classmates play.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were, as one would expect, still talking about the love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, did you manage to gather any clues?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nothing as of yet. Both Senpai and Yuika-chan aren't acting any differently from normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't think that it would be too weird if one of them was Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, both of them seem to be quite fond of you, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that they hate me or anything, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking about it, there's no way that a beauty like Sayuki-senpai or a cute girl like Yuika-chan would fall in love with me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you have no confidence in yourself, Keiki…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why, you ask… There's nothing about me that would make girls fall in love with me. My grades are average, I'm not particularly good at sports, and there's really nothing that makes me stand out from other guys." And I'm not handsome like Shouma either.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to a cute heroine should be a cool man. Someone with good grades, someone who's athletic, someone who's cool-looking, or someone like a hero. Men like that are way more popular with the girls than your average Joe. Just like the prince charming in the story about Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm no prince charming."</p>
<p class="null-p">He did receive a love letter, but he had no idea what made the girl fall in love with him. It would honestly be easier for him to understand if it were some sort of prank or accident. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't see a charming girl like Sayuki or Yuika head over heels in love with him like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Keiki's as hopeless as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, okay? You joined the calligraphy club for your senpai's sake so that it wouldn't get shut down. You looked after your kouhai, who was having trouble making friends because of her foreign appearance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why were you so kind to Tokihara-senpai and Koga-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's normal to help girls when they're in trouble, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Girls really are the cutest when they have a charming smile on their face. It was only because of that single reason. He just couldn't stand seeing a sorrowful look on their face, so he had to help them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I mean. Those are the points that make you special."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly that. Because you're an idiot like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I meant it in a good way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How can I be an idiot in a good way…?" That being said, Keiki understood that Shouma didn't mean it as an insult.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You might not realize it, but you really are a man that girls could fall in love with. I can guarantee it. And you did in fact receive a love letter, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… might be the case… but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The words written on that love letter were 'I love you,' so there should be girl out there who has feelings for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There really is a girl out there that feels that way about me…?" Just thinking that made his head feel numb.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Huh?" In that moment, Keiki felt someone's gaze upon him.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other side of the hall, the girls were lined up against the wall, waiting for their turn to play volleyball.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nanjou?" It might've been from far away, but he felt like their eyes met.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also- he could barely tell, but he thought that her cheeks looked slightly flushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he tilted his head in confusion, a voice screaming "Watch out!" entered his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?" He looked towards the voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, his vision went black and a sudden heat-like pain exploded from his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Gufu?!" He had been hit by a stray basketball, probably because of a missed pass. The sound of the dropping ball mixed with the sound of a collapsing human.</p>
<p class="null-p">……………</p>
<p class="null-p">……………</p>
<p class="null-p">……………</p>
<p class="null-p">A long silence followed. He didn't move, which made it look like time had stopped. As the one closest to the collapsed Keiki, Shouma froze up. Since Keiki showed no signs of getting up again, Shouma let out a scream that shook the whole gym hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keikiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened his eyes, Keiki found himself lying on a bed in the nurse's office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh… that's right, I was hit in the face by a ball…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was probably carried here by some other students.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Taking a basketball straight to the face…what is this? A manga?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he let out these words, he met the eyes of the girl sitting on a chair next to his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mornin'. School's already over, Mr. Sleepyhead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…" Sporting red hair with a side-tail, this girl was Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">Closing the book she had in her hands, she put it down on her thighs. Unlike Keiki, who was still in his gym clothes, she had already changed back into her usual school uniform. Stretching out from underneath her short skirt were her healthy-looking legs-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wait, huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, it's nothing…" He couldn't exactly tell her that he got aroused by her beautiful legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder why high school girls always have to wear their skirts so short. Yet they always get mad when the boys happen to see their panties. I really don't get it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is your head okay? Does it still hurt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. I feel much better now that I've taken a little rest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that. Akiyama was here until just a little while ago, but he had to go to his club activities. The nurse also had to leave to attend a staff meeting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That explains why there's nobody around… But, why are you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't have any plans today……and I thought it'd be better if someone stayed behind to watch over you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So Nanjou can actually be kind if she puts her mind to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut it. It's not like that." Seeing her act like a real tsundere, Keiki let out a small giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because she was aware of that, she said, "You cheeky little-" and poked his side.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_7.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Still, did something happen today? You were spacing out a lot, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did it really look like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it did. Just like when you took that ball to the face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you saw my receive, huh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, just remembering it makes me laugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that I think about it, it felt like our eyes met before that ball hit me… Maybe she was watching Keiki because she was worried about him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Kiryuu is always in his own world, but today it was worse than normal… Hey, were you looking at a girl that piqued your interest or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of her different, more direct choice of words, Keiki didn't know how to respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really? There really is a girl like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you're wrong. I was just lost in my thoughts or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so? …This sounds fishy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, there's nothing fishy about it at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Your face is turning red. Do you have a fever or something?" Mao stretched out her hand towards Keiki's forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any special meaning behind it or anything, it was just a little bit of skinship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, maybe because he was having trouble keeping his usual composure, he unconsciously found himself grabbing her hand as she stretched it out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her slender arm with delicate fingers. A body temperature that was a little bit cooler than Keiki's.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, he only saw her as a normal friend, but right now, he was embarrassingly aware of her as someone of the opposite gender.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nanjou…if I really had a girl like that, would you support me?" Before he realized it, Keiki had already spoken these words.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was sure that she would say yes. However, her reaction wasn't anything like he had expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I kind of don't want that… I probably wouldn't be able to honestly support you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing… Sorry, Kiryuu, I'll be going now," With these words, she dashed out of the nurse's office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that about…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alone in the room, Keiki pondered Mao's words. His heart was still beating like crazy. The reason for that was the face that the girl made as she ran away. It looked like she was upset that he was talking to other girls, almost like she was pouting. She had a 'girly face' that he had never seen on her before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me…is Nanjou my Cinderella?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Somewhere deep in his heart, his opinion of her had changed. Just like Shouma, he had met her after he became a high school student when they happened to end up in the same class. They had only known each other for about a year, but he still thought of her as a good friend. Because being with her was so comfortable, he didn't see her as a potential girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she was also a member of the cleaning operation, the chance that she was the sender of the love letter wasn't zero. Keiki realized that even Nanjou Mao was a candidate to be his Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">After changing back into his normal uniform, Keiki left the school building behind him. As he walked past a park near the school, he spotted a beautiful black-haired girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Cake-kun. Your name sounds delicious as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've had that discussion this morning already. And also……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had to look downwards at her to meet her gaze. The reason for this was because she was kneeling down. She was petting a huge white dog as she looked up at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What's up with this gigantic dog?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I happened to meet him here. I've decided to call him 'Vegetarian' for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's definitely a carnivore, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This giant dog clearly didn't look vegetarian at all. If you were to put meat and vegetables in front of him, he would definitely pick the meat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, he's clearly someone's pet. He has a collar, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a dark red collar securely fastened around the dog's neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He probably ran away while he was on a walk. It'd be nice if his owner was somewhere nearby…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking around, Keiki couldn't see anyone that might've been the owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Vegetarian. Do you know where your owner went?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woof!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How troublesome, Keiki-kun. It looks like he can't speak Japanese…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That'd be a real problem if he could!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, the two of them decided to look for the owner of 'Vegetarian' (temp), but it didn't take them very long. As soon as the dog spotted his owner, he immediately ran towards her. Said owner was a young girl in her early twenties. After taking the leash back and bowing down countless times to Keiki and Sayuki, she scolded her dog (whose name wasn't 'Vegetarian,' of course) with a "Really, you can't do that!" Looking over at Sayuki, Keiki noticed that she had a sort of lonely expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after they returned to the park, Sayuki didn't say anything, and seemed to be avoiding Keiki's gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sayuki-senpai? Is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well. I was just a bit envious, is all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? So Senpai likes dogs, huh? Can't you keep one at your house?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's not that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?" Keiki tilted his head at her vague answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like to be patted on the head by Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Why are you keeping quiet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, I just didn't expect that sort of request… where did that even come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really gave it my best for the calligraphy competition, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. Good work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I want a reward for my hard work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see. So, as your reward, you want me to pat you on the head."</p>
<p class="null-p">He said it like he understood her reasoning, but he really didn't. A request like this was really out of character for Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yesterday, you pat your little sister on the head, right? I would like to experience that as well… Will… you?" She looked up at him, saying these words with a sweet voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're fine with me, then I'll gladly do that!" Without thinking twice, Keiki accepted Sayuki's request.</p>
<p class="null-p">He started gently stroking her hair. Although she was a third-year who was a bit taller than Mao or Yuika, she still wasn't quite as tall as Keiki, so her height was no problem for him. Since this was his first time petting the head of a girl other than his little sister, though, he did feel quite embarrassed. Of course, doing something like this in general is rather embarrassing regardless of the situation. Especially considering that they were still standing in the middle of a public park, with other people occasionally walking past.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was having trouble keeping his embarrassment under control, Sayuki for her part was looking as calm as a cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… how is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well… I don't really know why, but it feels good." She seemed to be enjoying herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">They only stayed like that for about ten seconds. After Keiki pulled his hand away, he smiled at him bashfully. And then, without any warning whatsoever, she suddenly kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is your reward because you're always so kind," After she said these words with her usual charming smile, she turned around, her skirt fluttering.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face had a faint red tint to it and she murmured a soft "See you tomorrow," as her black hair slowly disappeared towards the setting sun. With his head in the clouds, and that soft sensation still lingering on his cheek, Keiki was left behind just like that. Unsure what had just taken place, he put one hand on said cheek and muttered:</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that…? I have no clue what's going on anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">The sender of the love letter, the panties that were left on top of it, that kiss just now. The only thing that he was sure of was that his heart was beating like crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh, Nii-san? You're home already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, yeah. I'm home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome back. What's wrong? You're kinda spacing out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't exactly tell her that I'm still in shock because of Sayuki-senpai's sudden kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha came out of the living room wearing an apron and holding a frying pan. She had already changed out of her school uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I managed to get some nice mackerel today, so we'll be having that with miso soup for dinner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, sounds great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'll be finished soon, so go ahead and change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll do that. Uhm, Mizuha. About yesterday……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After we finished cleaning yesterday, do you know which one of you left the room last?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki told Shouma about the love letter, Shouma had said that "The girl who left the room last has a high chance of being Cinderella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The last person, huh? Uhm-" He put one hand on her lips as she thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That must've been Tokihara-senpai if I remember correctly."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the name of the girl Keiki was with until a few minutes ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's nothing. Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying this, Keiki went up the stairs and headed towards his room. Unable to do anything else, he barely managed to close the door and leaned against it, slowly sliding down.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then unconsciously touched his cheek. The place where Sayuki had kissed him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So Sayuki-senpai is Cinderella?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The possibility certainly wasn't low. She wouldn't kiss a boy she didn't have any feelings for- At least, he thought she wouldn't, anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Sayuki-senpai really feels that way about me, I could probably crop a feel of her breasts whenever I want…" He imagined it in his head, being able to use those big melons however he'd like. "That wouldn't be so bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But no matter how much he enjoyed these fantasies, they certainly wouldn't become reality unless he could prove that she is his Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll go meet Senpai again tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">Deciding on that, he decided to go change his clothes… but found himself unable to do so. His body wouldn't listen, and his heartbeat wouldn't calm down either. For quite some time, Keiki was unable to move from that spot.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: My Senpai Can't Be This Abnormal</p>
<p class="null-p">"-‐Hey, Keiki-kun. The thing is, I've been in love with you for a long time now."</p>
<p class="null-p">After class. The calligraphy club room was illuminated by the setting sun as Keiki was confessed to by the senpai he had always admired. Confronted with the frozen stiff Keiki, the girl once more started talking with a marshmallow-like soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really like you, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was, of course, Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being Keiki's senpai with a one year difference, she had slightly flushed cheeks, making her look incredibly cute right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, close your eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">What exactly these words meant, the virgin Keiki didn't know. He just closed them as he was told. In complete darkness, there were only two things he felt as clear as day.</p>
<p class="null-p">The heat of her hand touching his cheek, and the gentle wind of her breath close to his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even now, his heart was about to leap out of his chest. Since this was the first time ever in his life, he was incredibly nervous. Towards Keiki's lips, Sayuki came closer with her own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Senpai-‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their breaths mixing into one, her soft-looking lips were about to touch his own.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Keiki's head felt a 'bang'.</p>
<p class="null-p">…………………Bang?</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, he woke up. Not in the clubroom, but in his own room. The sunlight shone through the openings of the curtains, telling him that it was morning already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could sum up in a few words what had just happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The 'it was all a dream' ending, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, during his sleep, he happened to roll out of bed and hit his head on the floor. It was a tragedy for him, considering what had happened in his dreams. His memories of the dream were still fresh, although not for too long, and he grit his teeth in frustration.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Just recently, Kiryuu Keiki had received his first love letter. With only the words 'I love you' written on a piece of paper, there was no name of the sender, or even an indication of who it might be. As a paperweight, the girl had used a pair of panties, hence the codename 'The Cinderella that dropped her panties', but her feelings for Keiki were almost certainly not a fluke. To get his first girlfriend ever, he had decided to investigate the identity of said 'Cinderella'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So the last person who left the room was Tokihara-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Mizuha told me yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">Classes were over. In a deserted classroom, Keiki and Shouma were sitting near the windows. Today's agenda was, once again, figuring out Cinderella's identity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Tokihara-senpai was the last person who left the room, the possibility that she is Cinderella is extremely high."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had spotted the love letter after the big cleaning operation inside the calligraphy club room. He had left the room for only a short amount of time, 10 minutes to be precise. From that, it was obvious that one of the members of the cleaning operation was likely the sender. Considering that the letter was left on top of a table, it could be further surmised that the last girl who left the room that day was Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Keiki. Where did you hide the evidence (panties)?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm keeping them secure in my own room. I can't have Mizuha find them, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd be in for a lot of trouble if she were to find something like that in your room, I'd imagine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just imagining her saying something like 'I don't like a perverted Nii-san' robs me of my will to live."</p>
<p class="null-p">As a siscon big brother, being told something like that would result in a fatal wound. It would probably smash his pride as a big brother. This was on a completely different level than something like his porn magazines being discovered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If only it were an actual glass she instead of a pair of panties, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With panties I can't just go around checking to see if it fits any girls, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you were to do that, it wouldn't just end with expulsion."</p>
<p class="null-p">Going to a girl and blatantly asking her something like "Would you try on these panties, please?" would probably end up in court as a case of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the panties are one thing, but I do think that Tokihara-senpai is a strong candidate. You two are rather close, after all, and she seems to really trust you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oya, your face says that you wouldn't complain if that were the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, of course I'd be happy if Sayuki-senpai was in love with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's really popular, after all. In the tennis club, she's at the top of the list of who the guys would want their first time to be with."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha!? Wait, first time you say…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it might sound a bit blunt, Keiki could understand the feelings of the boys.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, what's up with those proportions?</p>
<p class="null-p">Mixed with her long legs and slender figure, she had these magnificent melons. Keiki was sure that a lot of boys would die to get a feel of them. Just yesterday, actually, Keiki also had a fantasy of copping a feel of her marvellous chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though, I don't really have that much interest in big breasts, myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma is a bit different in that regard, isn't he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. I'm a lolicon after all," The pervert confessed with a refreshing smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's body features where the exact opposite of Shouma's preferences.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki. Rather than small in general, I prefer it when they're still in a growth spurt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll pass. I don't have the time to listen to your tastes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For example, someone like Koga-san would be great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're basically insulting Yuika-chan with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The first year library member Koga Yuika and Akiyama Shouma were acquaintances. After all, Shouma would visit Keiki during his working hours from time to time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I have to go to my club now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for keeping you here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm also interested in the identity of Cinderella, you know. You're planning on going to the calligraphy club after this, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that was my plan. I wanted to talk with Sayuki-senpai once more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so? Go get 'em, my prince."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I won't back down. If Senpai really is Cinderella, then I'd get a bigbreasted girlfriend, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is probably the first time where the prince is trying to uncover the identity of Cinderella because of her breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, Kiryuu Keiki is but a normal high school student. He's nothing like how a prince should be. Even so, that love letter was addressed at him and only him. Merely remembering the words 'I love you' inside that letter made his heart burn up in passion. That was why he wanted to respond to the girl's feelings as fast as possible. This feeling of his was his motivation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having separated from Shouma, he went to visit the calligraphy club room. Even after knocking, he wouldn't receive an answer, so he used his key to open the door. At times like this 'The girl' was in her own world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, just as I thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">Past the door, he saw a familiar scene. In the middle of the room, a female student with long black hair was writing something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">The third-year calligraphy club president. The person Keiki thought had the highest possibility of being Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She looks really cool when she's working like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">She always tied up her hair into a ponytail while she was working. Her soft fingers put her rich words onto the paper. No matter where one looked, she was breathtakingly beautiful. He had seen her like this countless times already, but now, Keiki found himself captivated by her once again. Without taking a seat, he merely stared at her until she noticed his presence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if Keiki-kun has some sort of superpower, always appearing right in front of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I only opened the door like always, but you didn't notice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Then, when will you learn some real superpowers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you trying to force superpowers onto me? I don't have any intentions of acquiring any skills like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a shame. I would really like to see the boy who leapt through time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of unreasonable request is that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems today's youth are giving up way too quickly. Why don't you just try flying through time right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't even fly normally, so how could I achieve that?" Keiki retorted as he pulled up a chair and sat down, leaving his bag in the chair next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Facing him was Sayuki, untying her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What were you writing? Your entry for the competition is already finished, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just felt like writing something. If I don't write something, I can't really calm down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you're that kind of person, I see. Similar to the people that can't calm down without smoking a cigarette."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You might be right. This might count as poisoning, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's quite a difference, I believe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their usual banter. This atmosphere was really relaxing for Keiki. However, at the same time, he felt something tickling inside his chest, like he wanted something to change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai is……just like always I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess. I don't feel any different."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu… How frustrating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">She really was acting like usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after what had happened, she didn't have an embarrassed look or anything. Yesterday after school, she had kissed Keiki's manly cheek. For Keiki, that was one of the biggest events in his life, but it didn't seem like Sayuki felt the same way about it. Thinking about that, Keiki felt a bit frustrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, there's something I want to ask you, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something you want to ask? …D-Don't tell me?!" She put her arms in front of her breasts as if she wanted to hide them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, but telling you my cup size is too embarrassing, so I can't answer that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not what I wanted to ask, you know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muh……when you say it like that, I feel like I want to tell you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't even want to reply to that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their conversations were always drifting in the wrong direction like that, but Keiki didn't have the time to enjoy that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? What did you want to ask, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, that's… Mhm? Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki mustered all the courage he had, but in that moment, a certain question entered his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">What if Sayuki-senpai actually isn't Cinderella?</p>
<p class="null-p">And that wasn't exactly limited to Sayuki. Even if he were to ask his potential Cinderella something like 'Were you the one who sent me a love letter?', what would happen if she were to answer with 'Eh, I don't know what you're talking about.'? That would be too cruel for Keiki's soft heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wouldn't even be able to apologize.</p>
<p class="null-p">Additionally, there were two other points he had to keep in mind when asking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Point Number 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">[The panties left together with the love letter.]</p>
<p class="null-p">He had to avoid that topic at all costs. After all, he couldn't just go and ask a girl 'Are these your panties?'. That would be sexual harassment, and it would brand him forever as a pervert. So, he had decided that the part about the panties was a forbidden topic for his investigation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Point Number 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">[The reason why the girl didn't write her name in the letter.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could only think of one reason. Not because the girl simply forgot about it, but rather because she wanted to hide her identity. There's no way that he would receive a simple 'Yes, it was me' after asking a candidate.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no doubt that Sayuki was under suspicion, but until he could ask her with more confidence, he had to investigate more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-kun? What's wrong?" Sayuki looked at him with a worried expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">The risk of her not being his Cinderella was still too great. He had to gather more information so that he wouldn't ruin this important friendship between Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm…the room is really clean now, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. That's pretty obvious, since we just recently cleaned it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Makes sense~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their conversation stopped in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, what's wrong with you, Keiki-kun? You seem really weird today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm always weird, though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not denying it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He really wanted her to deny it. It seemed like she always thought of him as weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leaving that joke behind, if you need help with anything, you can ask me, okay? Are you worried about something sex-related?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. And why would I ask a girl for advice about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't get you, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence. I don't understand Sayuki-senpai, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">She's really cool-looking when she's writing. But when she's not, she always acts like a child.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though yesterday she kissed him on the cheek, which should be a rather special occasion, she's acting like nothing happened at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems like there are times when I have no idea what she's thinking, even after being around her all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see. Actually, I don't know anything about Sayuki-senpai." Of course, he had a certain degree of knowledge concerning her even though they had barely known each other for a year.</p>
<p class="null-p">What kinds of books she likes. What kinds of food she likes. What types of music she likes. What makes her happy. This should be enough for a rough profile. However, he didn't know how she felt about her Kouhai Kiryuu Keiki. Until know, that was perfectly fine. He was fine with their current relationship. But, to judge whether she was Cinderella or not, that knowledge wasn't sufficient. Just one more step was missing.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you want to know more about another person, it's important to touch a side of them that you normally wouldn't. For example, Keiki didn't know what Sayuki was doing when she wasn't working on her calligraphy. He really only ever saw her in the calligraphy club room, so Keiki knew nothing about her life outside of the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki Keiki didn't know what she was like outside of school ‐ Keiki wanted to know more about her, so maybe he should ask her if she wanted to go out sometime.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, wouldn't that mean I'd have to invite her on this so called 'Date'?</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, dates were an opportunity for a boy and girl to get to know each other. Of course, it's not like Keiki had any experience going on dates with girls. None at all. Zilch. Zero. Nada.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, the question was…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder how I could invite Sayuki-senpai on a date……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing a faint voice, Keiki lifted up his head, his eyes meeting those of the baffled Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her lips then slowly formed the words "Date?" as her quiet voice leaked out. As if she had seen into the heart of her Kouhai with pinpoint accuracy. Or rather--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh? D-Did I say that out loud?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun wants to go on a date……with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had received an unexpectedly affectionate answer. Sayuki looked at him with expectant eyes. Keiki felt like his face had gotten hot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did I unconsciously manage to invite her?</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Keiki-kun wants to go on a date…I don't mind going with you, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a store near the train station that added a new parfait to their menu, but I'm kind of out of money for this month."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person is trying to sponge off me for her own desires?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With something like that, there is no way that a new love-comedy could be born.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, she's saying 'this month' but the month barely started… just how did she manage to use up all of her allowance in such a short amount of time…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"It it no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh, looking at me like that is unfair…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Women really are unfair. Especially when a beauty like her is giving me the puppy eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Boys are built to be weak towards that girly attitude. Being attacked with such a powerful weapon, they have no choice but to admit their defeat. "…I got it. I'll treat you to that parfait."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that it's decided, let's go! Immediately!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't start pulling! It won't run away, so we don't have to hurry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will. They only make 11 of them per day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems like even eating a parfait has turned into a war. The world of sweets really is terrifying. I've heard that girls have an excessive sweet tooth, but Senpai seems to be even more extreme about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">As they took a seat in the cafe near the train station, the waitress came to take their orders. Of course, Sayuki ordered the parfait while Keiki made do with a coffee.</p>
<p class="null-p">His coffee came in a simple cup while they brought the parfait on a big plate. The powdered green tea on top of the vanilla ice cream was matched perfectly, and seeing the cream combined with an accent of adzuki beans, it looked extraordinarily delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, just looking at it makes me happy. It seems like such a waste to eat it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Senpai won't it eat, I'll gladly take it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do feel bad for Keiki-kun, but that's the one thing I can't allow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, okay, then please, go ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Thank you," Seeming a bit nervous, she picked up the spoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Scooping away the top part, she put the spoon inside her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having tasted her first scoop, she closed her eyes in happiness with a</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm…!"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_8.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"It's really delicious. The flavours fit together so well!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that you like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you want a taste as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, we don't have another spoon, so I'll pass."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll feed you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a shame. I really wanted Keiki-kun to share this happiness with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just seeing Senpai like this has filled my stomach up to the brim."</p>
<p class="null-p">Merely seeing her happy face like this was plenty for Keiki. Girls may like sweets, but for boys, a girl's smile is just as wonderful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, what did you use your allowance for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit embarrassing, but I had a destined meeting with a beautiful brush."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You make it sound so romantic, but you probably bought it on a whim, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. If I think that it's worth it, then I won't regret it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why you had to give up on this parfait for so long."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's also fine. I got to go on a date with Keiki-kun, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, women aren't playing fair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Showing Keiki a bright smile like that, she could probably squeeze all of his money out of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem, this parfait wasn't that expensive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's also true, but I didn't mean that. I'm really grateful to Keiki-kun. We managed to avert the dissolving of the calligraphy club thanks to you joining."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. It's been one year already, hasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">One year ago, Keiki joined the calligraphy club for Sayuki's sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After my senpais all graduated, I was the only one left, and no one seemed to be interested in the club, either. But, Keiki-kun came to help me-" With a very nostalgic sounding voice, she smiled at Keiki, "At that time, I was really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">These words continued to reverberate inside his chest. Being told Sayuki's honest feelings like this, he felt the blood rushing to his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be a bit late to ask, but were you really fine with joining the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you don't have any interest at all in calligraphy, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's right, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you would've been fine as a ghost member, you still come around from time to time… Isn't that way too stressful for you? Your name on the registration form would've been enough, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that Keiki isn't exactly a calligraphy club member. His club activities were merely cleaning the room from time to time, reading a book, or watching Sayuki during her work.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really glad that I joined the calligraphy club. Senpai is beautiful, after all, and she looks so cool when she's working hard- Senpai is someone I look up to."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was showing his face at the club exactly because Sayuki was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because the person he admired was sitting there. "Also, when I'm with Senpai, I'm always having fun." That would be the most important reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki raised his voice again, Sayuki quickly averted her eyes with flushed cheeks. Seeing this rare response, he reacted the same way. But it wasn't exactly a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Sayuki continued to eat her parfait in silence. Keiki did the same, drinking his coffee. As time passed, the coffee disappeared, along with the parfait. The moment Sayuki used a handkerchief to wipe her mouth, Keiki gathered his resolve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you hiding something from me, by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiding something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For example, uhm, some sort of emotion towards me or something……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Time- had stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for that was clearly Keiki's spontaneous question. He had tried avoiding the topic of the love letter and the panties, but even so, he thought that this still turned out pretty bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">He expected Sayuki to say something like "You're too self-conscious. Stop with these fantasies." However, the expected verbal abuse never came. There was no answer at all, to be precise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Checking her expression because he thought something was off, he saw a look on her face like some kind of startled cat, frozen up in surprise. That sight was something he had never seen before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment her name was spoken out loudly, she jumped up from her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---, ----,"</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed like she wanted to say something, but the words wouldn't come out. Her face was as red as an apple and her eyes were wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was one of the faces that Keiki had not seen yet. A Sayuki outside of school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, I'm going home for now," Saying that with a quiet voice, she quickly grabbed her bag and rushed out of the cafe.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after silence had returned to the shop, Keiki could only space out, looking at the door Sayuki dashed out of.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've ever seen her like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">With just a simple question, he managed to rob her of her usual calmness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… Sayuki-senpai really is Cinderella?" That one response was enough to soften his doubts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's red face.</p>
<p class="null-p">To find out what kind of emotion that facial colour symbolized, he decided that it was necessary to shorten the distance between him and her even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mornin', Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Good morning, Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">At 8 o'clock in the morning, Keiki met Shouma at a road intersection.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How rare for you to be without Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she has class duty today, so she went on ahead. Same to you, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't you have morning practice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have to go every day. Taking breaks is also important." Having greeted each other, they continued their walk to school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And did you manage to get Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not at all. I did move forward, though. I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So yesterday was also no good…Ah, speak of the devil."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Shouma's gaze, Keiki spotted the girl they were talking about at the school gate. The moment he did, he dashed towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, I'm busy right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he raised his voice, her shoulders twitched slightly. After leaving these words, she ran away quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Just as I thought, she's avoiding me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that incident in the cafe, she was constantly avoiding him. Every time they happened to meet, she would try to get out of his way. It was as if they'd had a lover's quarrel. Because of that, he hadn't been able to speak to her at all these past few days.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Yuika-chan, mornin'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing a blazer, the blonde-haired foreign-looking Kouhai greeted Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning to you too, Akiyama-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning~! You're as cute as ever, Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? T-Thank you very much?" Yuika muttered after hearing Shouma's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Akiyama Shouma was always nice to girls, but towards younger girls, he acted like a true gentleman. Even more so when the girl had a young-looking face. A true lolicon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, did something happen with Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did you see that just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, she looked weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, a lot happened, I guess…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me; did she find out that you're always staring at her breasts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? But, Keiki-senpai, you do glance at them quite frequently, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">She must've realized that for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Are you serious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Women are quite sharp, after all. You should probably hurry up and apologize."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, but, you're still wrong……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that he was always fantasizing about her breasts, but he was, after all, an adolescent boy. Of course he'd be interested in something like that. And this clearly wasn't the reason that Sayuki was avoiding Keiki……or at least he thought not.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's true that I have to do something quickly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing would change like this, so he had to do something to shorten the distance between them again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it didn't prove as easy as he had hoped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki didn't show her face for club activities, nor was she in her classroom when he went there. Whenever he caught so much as a glimpse of her, she would ran away at full speed. Of course, he couldn't overstep his bounds any more, otherwise he'd clearly be labelled a pervert, or even worse a stalker.</p>
<p class="null-p">Knowing that the possibility that Sayuki was Cinderella was high, he thought that he could make progress quite quickly, but it wasn't turning out that way at all. And, being rejected like this, the damage just kept on rising.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, he was sitting in a deserted classroom, taking a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a big sigh alright. Your happiness will get out, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Raising his voice, Keiki saw the source of that mocking voice. With a short skirt and bright hair, tied together with a side ponytail, it was a classmate of his. Sitting down in front of Keiki, Nanjou Mao once more opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty rare to see you like this. Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well, recently, a certain person has been avoiding me and it's made me feel a bit depressed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A certain person…so Tokihara-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well……yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmpf."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you look so displeased now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not, though? It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">She never was the happy-go-lucky type to begin with, but her mood seemed to be even darker than usual as she said that. Although she always seemed to have no expressions, she was easy to see through at times like these.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't want the girl to run away, how about you pull a 'Kabe-don'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kabe-don? Is that the thing you often see in shoujo mangas and dramas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not just limited to that… but you're not wrong. So, how about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kabe-don- a technique that ikemen boys use on the beautiful heroine. Pushing the heroine into a corner, you gradually pull closer to her and make her heart go 'Doki Doki'.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, for boys that aren't as good-looking, doing something like this would probably result in something worse than just rejection.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you ever done it? A kabe-don?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Never. As if I'd ever do something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The only people who can pull something as embarrassing as that off are the ikemen who have a heart of steel. Ikemen really are amazing after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, what do real girls think about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it certainly won't work if they aren't interested in the boy. It might even end with them reporting the boy to a teacher for sexual harassment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though, if it's someone they like, their heart will go 'Kyun' for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it was just weird hearing such vocabulary from you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch?! Can you stop pinching my sides?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut it. Kiryuu said something rude after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a displeased expression, she pulled her hand away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's fine as long as you're not as down anymore. Go and make up with Senpai already. I can't keep watching you like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll be going home now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm…thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Replying with a "Yeah," over her shoulder, she left the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she didn't show it, she was probably worried about Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As always, she's a kind tsundere."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because she always seems rather cold, people often misunderstand her. Still,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew that as well, and he still decided to become friends with her. Just as she had indicated, Keiki had to make a move himself. If a man won't go on the offensive, he will die out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'll challenge her one more time." The time to sulk is over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, Sayuki was still at school. Guessing that she wouldn't be in the club room, he tried his luck at her classroom, where he happened to meet up with her in the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, I want to talk with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I have something important to do today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what would that be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A fan of mine is waiting at the venue."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please only start sleep-talking after you've actually fallen asleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll hurry home and jump into my futon."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it didn't end like this. Instead, Keiki stood in front of her, blocking her way forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He then managed to corner her into a wall and blocked her escape routes with his arms. Of course- a kabe-don.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having lost any chance of running away, Sayuki merely looked up at Keiki. As a third-year, she was taller than most of the other younger students, but she still wasn't as tall as Keiki. Seeing her small, shaking shoulders, he actually started to feel bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is rougher than I thought it would be.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was not romantic at all. Instead of an accelerated heartbeat, a girl would probably be shocked if something like this were done to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm…Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to check that she was okay, to make sure that he hadn't scared her. The moment their gazes met, however, her cheeks went red in an instant. And then she pouted slightly, averting her eyes soon after.</p>
<p class="null-p">Woah, what's with this cute reaction?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging by her reaction, she didn't seem to be scared. On the contrary, it looked like her heart went 'Kyun', exactly like Mao had told him.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, is there still some room for me in that heart of hers?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun… let me go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll scream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you really hate me, then go ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's unfair, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care."</p>
<p class="null-p">His words were calm, but he clearly felt the heat in his face. Still, these exact words were influenced by that feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did I say that 'If you really hate me, then go ahead' anyway? I already feel like I'm dying, and I'm still in the middle of the conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm serious today, I won't let you get away now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You merely stopped me in my tracks. You can't force me to talk. I have the right to remain silent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right to remain silent, you say…well, that's fine. Even if Senpai doesn't talk, I sure as hell will."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know Sayuki-senpai's secret."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as he had expected, her reaction fit. Keiki's words had caught her off guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she had just answered with "I don't know what you're talking about," it would've been Keiki's loss. However, her own reaction sealed off her escape route.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's speculations were right. The 'secret' he was talking about was of course the love letter. Her being the last person who left the room, her behaviour around him, everything pointed to the fact that she was Cinderella. Although he didn't have any solid proof, all he had to do was make her spill the beans herself. That's why he decided to take the risk. And it looked like it was a success.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…How long…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short pause, she continued, "How long ago did you figure it out…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just recently. I didn't have any proof, but I deduced it from your attitude."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…" She dropped her shoulders in defeat, only to look up at him shortly after.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes started to get watery and her shoulders where shaking softly. Like she was afraid. Like she was in despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does Keiki-kun…" With tears in her eyes, she opened her mouth once more, "After finding out about my secret… did you start to hate me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I don't hate you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?" Maybe because she didn't expect that response, her eyes went wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The moment I realized that you thought that way, I was surprised, yes. But, uhm, I didn't hate… it, I guess. Rather, I was really happy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no way that Keiki wouldn't be happy if the Senpai he was looking up to had feelings for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, really."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing his response, Sayuki looked at Keiki as if she didn't expect it at all. Seemingly making up her mind, she brought her hand to her chest and spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………After school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow after school, will you come to the clubroom? I have something important I want to talk about." Leaving only these words behind, the both of them separated.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no reason to chase after her anymore. That promise was enough for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">That evening. Keiki was lying face up on his bed, stretching his arm out towards the ceiling. Of course, he was looking at the pair of panties in his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">If someone were to see this scene, it would be an immediate red card for Keiki. However, these panties where the only hint besides the love letter that connected him to Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I think about it, this is quite the elaborate design."</p>
<p class="null-p">For boys, the appearance of undergarments don't matter at all as long as they fit. For girls, the complete opposite is true.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just thinking that these might be Sayuki-senpai's panties……gulp."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!" Keiki almost fell out of his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having entered the room, Mizuha, the source of the voice, tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened to make you scream like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you knock, please?! Even if we're family, I still have my privacy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did, but you never responded."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I didn't expect you to be so surprised, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you looking at some porn magazines?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I wasn't……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was actually something more dangerous. He had hurriedly stuffed the panties behind him, so she shouldn't be able to see them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did you want, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah. The bath is free, so I wanted to tell you that," Having come out of the bath just recently, she was wearing her pyjamas as she stared at Keiki. "Somehow, it seems that Nii-san is spacing out all the time recently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, even now, you looked like a lost kid or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well, I was thinking about some stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stuff?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, love(koi)-related stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not the fish (koi), right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, not the fish."</p>
<p class="null-p">An endless topic in dramas and novels. People fall in love in mysterious ways, and no matter how much they try to get away it always comes back to them one way or another. And Keiki didn't have any experience with that whatsoever. He didn't know if he simply looked up to Sayuki as his senpai, or if he had real feelings for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow, I might get confessed to by a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Congratulations?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you say it like a question? Well, thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl would be the sender of the love letter. Being called to the clubroom after school and talking about something important, was it? There was no mistake that it would be a confession of love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I really get confessed to, what do you think I should do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if you think that she's nice, then go out with her. If not, then you turn her down, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…yeah, it makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">If Sayuki really is in love with me, and if she were to confess to me and we started going out… Keiki tried imagining that scenario.</p>
<p class="null-p">Talking with her in the clubroom, letting her scribble on his face, walking to the cafe… nothing much would probably change. But he would finally have his long-waited lover, and that time with her would be even sweeter than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">This future with her would be surely be a blessing for him. It was safe to say that Kiryuu Keiki was attracted to Tokihara Sayuki. To say it in the words of Mizuha, he thought of her as 'nice'. Keiki was sure that this feeling would turn into love. He was absolutely sure about that.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, he wasn't able to concentrate during school at all. The whole time, one girl was the only thing on his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, it was finally time. Knocking on the clubroom door, he received a "Come in," as an answer. As Keiki entered, Sayuki was sitting next to the window, merely gazing at the setting sun. Her long black hair was swaying and she called out to him like she always did.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just as promised, I'm here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I was waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">He realized that her cheeks were slightly flushed. She was probably just as nervous as Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have something important I want to talk about. Will you listen to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, please tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki took a deep breath and looked straight at Keiki. She then opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For a while now I've thought that Keiki-kun was 'nice.' And I was sure that you would accept my everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun, close your eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like he had dreamed. He reacted just as he had in that dream, expecting that soft feeling on his lips to follow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………………………………………Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, no matter how long he waited, that moment didn't arrive. Rather, he heard a metallic clattering sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can open your eyes now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes…………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he opened his eyes, he saw something he never expected, not even in his dreams. To be specific, Sayuki had taken off her blazer and opened the upper part of her blouse, revealing a large part of her breasts. He could even see her bra.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-, Sayuki-senpai?! What are you doing?!" Even though he turned around immediately, that sight, paired with her pure white skin, was burned into his memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Please don't scare me like this, cover yourself up please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, so look, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, even if you tell me that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you embarrassed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I am?! Senpai is embarrassed too, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I want you to look…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, she hugged him from behind. A bold hug like lovers would do. And of course, two soft balloons were pressing against Keiki's back, sending shockwaves throughout his entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?! Your breasts are hitting me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's trivial."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your breasts are too big to actually call them trivial, though?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a boy like Keiki with no experience concerning that, the impact was way too big to just label it 'trivial.' And she wasn't even wearing her blazer. With the blouse opened up, that soft feeling was transmitted almost directly to his skin, only stopped by her underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is this going to end up like one of those R-18 scenes? Wouldn't that be a bit too fast?</p>
<p class="null-p">As lovers, they would arrive at that point sooner or later, but they weren't even going out yet, nor had they even officially admitted their feelings for each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Keiki-kun won't look at me, then I will have to go completely naked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?! P-Please don't do that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, will you look at me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got it! I got it already, so let me go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If she were to undress even more, his mind would probably go blank.</p>
<p class="null-p">Accepting his conditions, the girl separated from Keiki. Taking a deep breath, Keiki mustered up his resolve and turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing there was, as expected, the same girl from before, her breasts still clearly visible. The sight of her was so beautiful that his heartbeat accelerated immediately. It robbed him of his ability to think- that's why he realized the presence of the abnormality far too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">That something, with a deep red colour, shouldn't be there. Not in this scene, not in this situation. Yet, it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around her slender neck, there was collar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A coll…ar……? Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked similar to the one he had seen just recently around Vegetarian's neck. But for what reason would a collar like that be around her neck?</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of the frozen stiff Keiki, Sayuki took out a leash. Connecting it to her collar, she handed it to the poor boy. Just like she would hand her loved one a love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">With fittingly flushed cheeks, an expression befitting a young maiden, Tokihara Sayuki said the following words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…please make me your pet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………………Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki. Sixteen years old. A high school student in his second year.</p>
<p class="null-p">He received his first ever confession. Yet it was so abnormal that he instead fell into despair.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: Since When Was I Under The Illusion That This Would Be A Normal Love Comedy? </p>
<p class="null-p">Not a lot of time had passed since classes had ended. Inside the clubroom, Keiki was standing, merely spacing out. In front of Keiki was a female student wearing a dog collar that had taken off her blazer and opened up her blouse.</p>
<p class="null-p">That female student, Tokihara Sayuki, had just said "Please make me your pet, Keiki-kun," a completely perverted confession. With these words, she tried to hand him the leash that was connected to her collar. In this situation, Keiki had lost his ability to think logically.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, will you make me your pet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"---W-Wait a moment, please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By 'pet,' what exactly do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just as I said. I want you to become my owner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not good, I still don't get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Become my master?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not what I meant!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand why Keiki-kun is so mad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand what you mean either!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't understand her feelings at all when she said "Make me your pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">What exactly does she mean by 'pet,' anyway? What does she mean by asking Keiki to become her owner? Countless questions were floating around in his head, and he was unable to follow the situation at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see. You're teasing me. Aren't you, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That whole confession was a joke, and she was just doing it to get a reaction out of Keiki. However, hearing his response-</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way that I would make a joke like this," Her words completely denied his speculation, "Keiki-kun, you told me, right? That you won't hate me even if I'm like this. I didn't expect my secret to get out like this, but I was really happy when you said that you'd accept me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Wait…what secret?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That I'm a slutty M bitch."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, Keiki finally understood. About the fact that they both had misunderstood each other. Keiki was thinking that Sayuki was his Cinderella and that she was hiding it. That's why he told her that he knew her secret, making Sayuki think that Keiki knew of her fetish. Since Keiki had told her that he wouldn't hate her, she had understood it to mean that Keiki would accept her everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't expect you to be so rough either……" Still misunderstanding, Sayuki spoke with slightly flushed cheeks, "I don't hate it if you get a bit more rough…Yeah, I prefer the more forceful type. Even yesterday, that kabe-don made my heart beat like crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Senpai he looked up to was a perverted masochist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, not good. Not good Sayuki. A dirty girl like you will be scolded by Keiki-kun… Ahh, but I really want to be scolded by him. To become his pet and be scolded by him every day is a dream…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It wouldn't be so bad to be praised, either, but being scolded is one of the joys of being a pet. Do you remember that lost dog? He looked really happy even though he was scolded by his owner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's why you had such an envious look on your face……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I also want to be scolded like that by my master. How nice……I want to be scolded like that too - is what I thought…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of foreshadowing is this?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">So this means that after school that time, she didn't have that look on her face because she wanted to play with Vegetarian more. She had that look on her face because she was envious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, Keiki-kun. Please make me your pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how you looked at it, Keiki was just a normal high school boy, neither a prince nor a master. And of course, he didn't plan on taking in a pet like this. That's why his answer had been decided for quite some time time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, that's impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he still declined her offer very politely. </p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning of the next day. With a downcast expression, Keiki walked towards his classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that Sayuku-senpai had a hidden side like that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person he had looked up to was a massive masochistic pervert. This fact damaged poor Keiki's heart quite a bit. He couldn't even get a single wink of sleep, merely lying awake in his bed. If he didn't receive some comfort from his little sister (who misunderstood the situation and thought that he'd gotten turned down), he might've never recovered from that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, I still haven't found out if Sayuki-senpai is actually my</p>
<p class="null-p">Cinderella or not. Not like that really matters right now, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">The impact of that confession was too strong, making him completely forget about his original goal. There was no use in dwelling on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, I'll just go to classes as usual and ask Shouma for some advice again.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he went up the stairs, he met up with the calligraphy club's advisor. Short hair with almond eyes. With her usual suit, she looked more like a businesswoman than a teacher.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, if it isn't Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning Okita-sensei."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mornin'. Good work on cleaning the club room like that. I'm glad that you managed to get it clean again… Ah, but you left without locking the door, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? The door wasn't locked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I came to check on your work after you were gone. Well, it's not like there were any problems, so I guess it doesn't matter." With that, Okita-sensei left, leaving Keiki behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside his head was a vortex of thoughts created by Okita-sensei's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So the room wasn't locked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The day they had the big cleaning operation, Keiki was supposed to have locked the door. But that's weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki has a rather methodical personality. Be it his home or the clubroom, he always checks twice that he locks the doors. He had done so on that day, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that door was still open after he left, then-</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, when you found the love letter, Cinderella was with you in the club room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I'm suspecting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lunch break. Sitting on a bench in the courtyard, Keiki was asking Shouma for advice just as he had planned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After that cleaning operation, I locked the door for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But when Okita-sensei came by to check, it wasn't locked, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. We only have one key, and Sayuki gave it to me so that I could lock up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It makes sense. Before Okita-sensei came by, the person who had been hiding inside the room sneaked out by opening the door from the inside and left."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the club room is on the second floor, the only way to escape is through the door. And Keiki had the only key. Without the key, you could still open it from the inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I came back with the bucket, Cinderella must've panicked and hid somewhere in the room."</p>
<p class="null-p">The club room wasn't exactly big, but you could probably hide in the lockers or behind the teacher's desk. It wasn't impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, any of the girls could've come back during the time when you were washing the bucket."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That lessens the importance of the order in which the girls left. Basically, the chance that a girl other than Tokihara-senpai could be Cinderella has gone up by quite a bit again."</p>
<p class="null-p">That brings their search for Cinderella back to square one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But still, Tokihara-senpai has the highest chance of being Cinderella. Have you managed to talk to her recently?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Shouma's question, he was hesitating for a bit. He was thinking if it really was okay to tell Shouma about her confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did manage to talk to her, but I didn't get anything out of her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, what a shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it really is. By the way, Shouma, have you ever wanted to make a girl your pet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When was your awakening, Keiki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what? That question is way too random."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was just wondering. I happened to read one of Mizuha's manga and there was something like that in it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, yeah, shoujo mangas are getting more radical lately."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki let out a small sigh because he managed to play it off with that halfassed lie. Although his chest did hurt a little bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I do like smaller girls…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And if I say something like 'I want to make a younger girl my pet', then mister Police Officer-san would come pick me up pretty quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">A lolicon's way of thinking really wouldn't be a good reference after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about the other way around? Would you want to become a woman's pet?" Shouma asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… not really, no," Keiki had never thought about that, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want to make Sayuki-senpai his pet, and he didn't want to become a pet for her, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't exactly understand either Shouma's fetish 'Liking small girls' or Sayuki's fetish 'Being someone else's pet.' He didn't understand the case with Cinderella, either. Why didn't she put her name on the love letter? Why did she leave her panties behind? Questions and more questions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, it might be good to look into the other girls as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm, yeah. I'll do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thanked his friend who had gotten the conversation back on track. He decided that he would move on slowly, taking one step at a time.</p>
<p class="null-p">After class. Being on duty as a member of the library committee, he was sitting in a small room inside the library, rearranging some books.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were getting new books every day, so someone had to arrange them onto the various bookshelves. That being said, the teacher had done most of it already, and had only left a small number behind, so it wasn't that much work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He glanced towards the counter.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a pen in hand, the short, blonde-haired female student was looking over some papers. Her name was Koga Yuika. Being Keiki's Kouhai, she was also a member of the library committee.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, everything's here," Having finished checking on the books, Yuika stood up, "Well then, Yuika will go bring them to the storage room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It's not a large amount anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so? I'll leave it to you then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, leave it to Yuika," Smiling like an angel, she went into the storage room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her smile like this, he could feel his heart heal just a little bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan really is cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Yes. Her small chest and behind… Everything is so small, it's very cute." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing these curse-like words near his ear, he felt a hot breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaa?!" Keiki let out a loud scream of surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, there was a girl with long black hair. The name of this girl with the big breasts is Tokihara Sayuki. Without him realizing, Sayuki had sneaked behind the counter, blowing into his ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, thanks for showing me such a cute reaction."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?! What are you doing all of a sudden?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm blowing into Keiki-kun's ears."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I'm bored?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What bad taste! That's really bad for my heart, so can you please not do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you mad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, doing something like this just because you're bored made me mad a little bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, that's not good. Then don't you think that a bad girl like me needs punishment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Keiki-kun, tease much as much as you want. As weird as you can get, please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't even know where I should start…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine wherever you want. I will accept my reward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do prefer if you'd start with my mouth instead of my ass."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-W-What the hell are you saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could clearly hear his high school image breaking into a thousand pieces. It was really fortunate that no one was currently in the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, what exactly do you want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I came here to meet Keiki-kun. Of my own accord," With these words, she came closer to Keiki, pressing her breasts against him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?! Y-Your breasts are hitting me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's trivial."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you before that your breasts clearly aren't 'trivial'?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I'll hug you even tighter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Too close!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's sweet fragrance was directly attacking his ability to think.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm…Keiki-senpai, Tokihara-senpai? Can you not do something like that inside the library?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, there was the blonde-haired kouhai. It looked like she had just returned from the storage room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, if it isn't Koga-san. A good day to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello…" Her reply didn't sound friendly at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">She clearly glared at Sayuki who was still clinging to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-senpai, aren't you clinging to Keiki-senpai a bit too much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. He's my kouhai, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai is still Yuika's senpai……"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_9.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, a resolute Koga-san is cute, too. But, I guess that you don't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">These past few days, Keiki-kun and I have gotten pretty close."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We went on a date the other day. He treated me to a parfait at the cafe near the train station."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Sayuki's words, shock was written across the blonde-haired girl's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you went to a cafe together… as a date, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the sometimes oblivious Keiki realized that the air around him had become drastically colder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, are you mad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if she was, do you know the reason why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, because you also wanted to eat the parfait?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot! Keiki-senpai, you idiot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun is in the wrong here, clearly. You really are an idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This flow of conversation is really bad. That's the only thing I understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once he understood that, he had to hurry to stop it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Sayuki-senpai. We're disturbing the other people in here like this, so why don't you go home for today, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How rude, Keiki-kun. Even though we did this and that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly is 'this and that?!'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You pushed yourself onto me, so roughly -didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was my first time, so I was really scared…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Sayuki's easy to misunderstand words, Yuika gazed at Keiki like she was looking at trash.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No! The only thing I did was a kabe-don!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've never seen such an aggressive Keiki-kun before…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you stop with that? Yuika-chan's gaze is starting to really hurt!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His cute kouhai's gaze was extraordinarily cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, your pride is starting to crumble away, so will you please stop it already…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so a library club member is going to refuse to help a customer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you want to borrow a book, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I'll take this one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is-"</p>
<p class="null-p">The book that she took out was 'The right way to keep a dog'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's up with this book?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to get a few references for my self-training."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Self-training?! This is the first time I've heard something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Keiki was hesitating, he still had to do his job as a library club member, so he began filling out the lending form. Having finished that, Sayuki took the book in her hands and smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope you look forward to it. In the near future, I will be someone completely different."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a cute wink, she left Keiki standing there. Yuika for her part returned to the counter and sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has a question for Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki twitched and answered in formal language unconsciously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you went on a date with Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, that wasn't exactly a date…I was just treating her to a parfait she really wanted……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it was a date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it was a date."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, next question."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What would it be this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you pull a kabe-don on Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm…Yes, I did…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Lewd."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that really a legitimate association?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then are you dating Tokihara-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why would you end up with that conclusion?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Keiki-senpai, you're always so kind to her. You go and clean the club room for her and you almost force her to go home when she's tired. And, you also went on a date with her…Recently, you've been all over Tokiharasenpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he called out, she turned her back to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Might she be……jealous?</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like she had some sort of feelings for him. But Keiki had only thought that this was her looking up to him as a senpai. That doesn't have to be connected to a feeling of love. Maybe it's just her goodwill… But what if… What if it was actually a feeling beyond goodwill? What if she had feelings for this boring highschool boy?</p>
<p class="null-p">What if Koga Yuika was actually Keiki's longed-for Cinderella?</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't impossible. After all, she was also a member of the cleaning operation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, putting that part on hold, how could I improve her mood again?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I do something to make you happier?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Now that you say it, we don't have school tomorrow, right?" His kouhai looked over her shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her gaze filled with expectation, Keiki happened to expect something too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she really is the girl that sent me the love letter?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki-senpai, please go on a date with Yuika on Sunday." With slightly flushed cheeks, the girl said these words.</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day, for the first time in his life, Keiki made plans for a date with a girl. </p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Sunday. Keiki arrived ten minutes early at the spot they agreed to meet up. Standing under a blue mid-May morning sky, he gazed at the people walking past him. And finally, the person he had been waiting for arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, Yuika-chan, good… morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yuika that came walking towards him had a different aura than usual. She was wearing a blouse and minishorts. Having her short blonde hair styled to one side in a dumpling, she looked like a real grownup. Pairing that with her natural good looks, she attracted quite a lot of gazes from the other boys around the area.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" Of course, that was the same for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well, this is the first time I've seen you in casual clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How…is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You look really cute. It really suits you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe. It seems like it was worth all the effort."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her like this, Keiki started reminiscing about the past. Right now, she was cheerful with plenty of different expressions. However, that wasn't the case when he first met her. Unlike now, she had never smiled back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Senpai, what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry. It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">This isn't the time to be dwelling in the past. For now, I have to focus on the date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright then, I thought of a plan for today, so would you leave it to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, Yuika will leave it all up to your wonderful plan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's some serious pressure……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Senpai is older than Yuika, after all, so please show me what you can do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Then, as your senpai, I'll escort you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing his words, Yuika snickered. That being said, Keiki didn't really have any experience going on dates. He had gone on a date with Sayuki, but that was just eating a parfait at a cafe on the way home.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something like that would never satisfy Yuika-chan - he thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, I'll do my best with Mizuha's 'Guide to dating'."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the evening before his date, Keiki was worried because of the date, so he decided to ask Mizuha for advice. She then proceeded to hold a whole lecture on how to treat the girl, how to choose the right places, and so on. This lecture lasted late into the night. Mizuha might normally come across a bit frivolous, but she still was a girl. And hearing advice from a girl like her was really valuable information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, let's keep walking a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay," Seeing her smile as bright as the sun, Keiki's sleep-deprived state completely faded away.</p>
<p class="null-p">A man dozing off on a date is really the worst, after all. And this date today has an important goal. To investigate whether Koga Yuika was the Cinderella who dropped her panties. If she was, Keiki might find some hints while he was on this date. Steeling his resolve, he started walking beside his Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first stop that Keiki thought of was the cinema.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A movie, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that something orthodox to start with would be a good idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, Yuika likes a simple approach."</p>
<p class="null-p">Buying the tickets, the both of them entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa, it's been a long time since Yuika has been to a cinema like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, is that so, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Yuika prefers to stick to her normal habits, and doesn't go many places. The only place she really goes to is the book store or the library from time to time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what I would expect from a bookworm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where are our seats?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the middle, where it's the easiest for us to see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, how convenient."</p>
<p class="null-p">As they went their way to their seats, Yuika really had a nostalgic look on her face as she looked around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, what movie are we going to watch today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm, you'll see when it starts, so look forward to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? A surprise, huh? Now Yuika is looking forward to it," She grinned. Really, no matter what she does, this kouhai is just cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was a Sunday, a lot people came after them into the cinema. After about ten minutes, the lights went out. Another few minutes after that, the movie finally started.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the prologue was over, the title was shown, seemingly surprising the kouhai next to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, isn't this……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's the live-action adaption of the book you read a while ago. You told me that the story was interesting, so I wanted to check it out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika was barely talking about it… and you still remembered it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did the surprise work?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu, it seems like this is Yuika's loss."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of war are you participating in…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that short exchange, both of them enjoyed the film. It was a story with a castle as its setting with a prince as the protagonist. Said castle was wrapped up in countless problems, but since the prince had no self-confidence, he didn't know which choice to make. The ones that supported the prince, a rather cheeky but still friendly maid and a powerful knight that lacked motivation were featured characters. After countless trials and the support of his servants, the prince started to trust in himself more. It was a movie with strong emphasis on comedy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a glance at the seat next to him, Keiki saw his kouhai completely engrossed in the film. Seeing that, he relaxed a bit and focused on enjoying the movie, himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the cinema, the both of them entered a fast food restaurant nearby. Eating their lunch there, they went towards the shopping mall. It was time for the window-shopping part of the date.</p>
<p class="null-p">They checked out various stores, from daily necessities to western clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">And it seemed like Yuika really enjoyed herself during that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now it was around 3pm in the afternoon. After walking around for quite some time, they decided to take a quick break. Buying something to drink at a nearby store, they set down in a table in the resting area of the mall. While Keiki was cooling his throat with an ice coffee, Yuika was drinking a cafe latté with a cute expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There really are a lot of stores around here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, but in the end we didn't buy anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Our goal was a date, not shopping, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">The goal on a date is for a boy and girl to get to know each other better and deepen their relationship. And to Keiki, it felt like they did achieve that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That film was really interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. In the first half, it was mostly just a comedy, but towards the end I even got moved a bit at some scenes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That flow was a bit irregular to be fair. And they even changed a few things compared to the original work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really? Uwa, now I want to read the original too."</p>
<p class="null-p">That wasn't exactly rare. A lot of movies and dramas get produced so that more consumers get interested in the original work. Keiki was a perfect example of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe I should read the original too. Ah, but they didn't have it in the library."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika can lend it to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be great!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Keiki-senpai isn't the type to read a lot of books, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm, yeah. I do read manga, but I'm not the novel type."</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't compete with a bookworm like Yuika, that's for sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why did you join the library committee?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, this is a story about my first year… I didn't even plan on joining any committee at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, then why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was a girl sitting next to me in class who was always looking pissed. At first, that girl was chosen to be on the library committee. You know when nobody wants to join the committee in question, a person gets decided with a majority vote or a lottery, right? And she happened to be chosen in the lottery."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was nothing she could have done about it. She just happened to be unlucky that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that girl started crying next to me after she got chosen. I decided to listen to her circumstances, and apparently she had some urgent business after school that she wouldn't be able to do if she had to act as a library committee member. It didn't seem like she was lying, and she seemed really troubled by it, so I decided to take it over for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's how he became a library committee member, even in his second year. That was his only reason to join and he didn't really have a reason to stop either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That…sounds very Senpai-like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Yuika thinks that these parts of Keiki-senpai are really cool." The girl said with a soft voice as she played with the drink in her hand, "Even today, you matched your walking speed with Yuika's."</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl's pace is completely different from a boy's after all, so he had to match her stride or he would eventually leave her behind. Although Keiki didn't have any experience with dating, he had gone out with his little sister Mizuha fairly often, so he did that unconsciously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although I'd like to boast about it, I'm actually pushing my limit here. To be honest, this is the first time I've gone on an actual date."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, really. That one time with Sayuki-senpai didn't feel like a date at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Reminiscing about the time he treated Sayuki to a parfait, he showed a painful smile. It's true that he had fun then, but it felt completely different than the date today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, it seems that Yuika is your first, hm?" She showed a bright smile he had never seen on her before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, his cute kouhai had made his heart jump in his chest countless times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This might be a passing mark," She muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's nothing," She stood up from her seat, "Yuika will go to the toilette real quick," She said as she walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, to think I would be able to go on a date with such a cute girl…Am I going to die tomorrow?" Keiki wondered as he watched her back get smaller and smaller.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan is really taking her time, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost twenty minutes had passed since she left her seat. Keiki knew very well that girls had to freshen up, comb their hair, put on make up, and so on in the toilet. But Yuika-chan wasn't so superficial that she would make her Senpai wait so long. That's why he started to get worried that something might have happened. Accidents and so on don't only happen in dramas, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe I should go check on her…" Keiki stood up from his seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">After checking around for about 5 minutes, he managed to find her. It isn't that hard to spot a short, beautiful, blonde-haired girl, after all. However, Keiki didn't have the leeway to feel glad about finding her. In front of a CD store inside the mall, Yuika was surrounded by a group of three delinquent boys. From the looks of it, they seemed to be university students. They were even taller than Keiki, and were crowding around Yuika, preventing her from slipping away. Despite the mall being full of people, nobody was trying to help her. Nobody wanted to cross that bridge for her. Nobody dared to approach those delinquent-looking boys. Even the women passing by didn't spare a second glance, although this could have easily happened to any one of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki got closer, he heard the voices of the boys.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Come play with us, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Aren't you hungry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-You really are cute, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were looking like they were having fun, not giving her any chance to say anything back. Like a group of selfish princes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika for her part didn't say anything. Every emotion had vanished from her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki remembered those eyes. She looked like Koga Yuika had when he had first met her. An atmosphere as cold as ice, expressionless just like a puppet. You could've broken her with one touch, like glass. When she entered high school, she completely refused to listen to her surroundings. And she would probably still be like that if Keiki hadn't approached her. Unable to watch Yuika in that state, Keiki stepped in between her and the three boys.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry but she's here with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go," Grabbing her hand, he pulled her way from that place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having lost their target, the boys gave up. They grumbled stuff like</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever, let's look for another cute one," as they watched Keiki and Yuika leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After walking around the mall again for about ten minutes without speaking a single word, Keiki finally separated his hand from Yuika's. As she stopped walking, there was not a glimmer of a smile on Yuika's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is sorry. Even though you looked forward to this date so much, she ruined everything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need for you to apologize. It was my fault for letting such a beauty like you walk around alone in here."</p>
<p class="null-p">He apologized for not looking out for his date partner. And Yuika looked at her Senpai with a surprised expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That was unfair."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, you have some dust on your head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll get it off for you, so bend over."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki did just as she asked. She then brushed away his bangs and kissed him on the forehead without any warning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……Uhm, that was?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe. That was thanks for saving Yuika. And by the way, there wasn't any dust at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You looked like a prince on a shining horse just now, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, I'm sure that you're exaggerating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Yuika is sure that a shining horse would fit you, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no. Only as a joke, if at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">A shining horse would fit Shouma much more than the boring Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, should we go home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you fine with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, Yuika had a lot of fun. But there is one more thing that she would like to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What would that be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like… this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time that cute voice entered his ears, he felt a soft sensation on his arm. Yuika had suddenly grabbed Keiki's arm, to be precise. "Y-Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's walk like this all the way to the train station, okay?"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_10.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"No no, this is too embarrassing…and your chest is hitting me……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't mind, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well I do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You do? Even though they are so 'trivial' compared to Yokihara-senpai's?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You heard that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Keiki couldn't say anything back and just did as Yuika told him. Because of that, they attracted a lot of dirty glares from the boys around them, making the walk home even more embarrassing for Keiki than it already would have been. But he felt like him and Yuika got a bit closer thanks to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, despite all that happened, I would still consider this date a success.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had such a good time that he completely forgot about his investigation of Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Yuika-chan really is Cinderella, I wonder if we would do stuff like this all the time……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As they rode the train home, his Kouhai leaned against his shoulder and Keiki gently patted her head while he thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">What it would look like if Yuika was his Cinderella and they spent their days as lovers?</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sure that every day would be like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching the same movie, discussing it and laughing about it. With that scenery in his mind, Keiki was sure that they would make a great couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with this girl next to me? …She's way too cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her sleeping face made her look like an angel. Her hair was so soft. From time to time, he really lost his ability to see her as a fellow human being. Even that time when she had kissed him on the forehead. This whole date, his female kouhai made his heart beat like crazy the whole time.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"So in the end, you still couldn't find out if Koga-san is your Cinderella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I completely forgot to investigate that because I had so much fun on the date."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, isn't it? Not enjoying a date with such a cute girl would've been such a waste. As someone who's quite fond of lolis, I think you made the right choice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really not into lolis, though. And, Yuika-chan clearly isn't a loli. She's a high school student."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the following day, Monday. During lunch break, Keiki and Shouma were in the school cafeteria.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha happened to sleep in today, which was a rarity for her, so she couldn't make a lunch box for Keiki. With that in mind, they had decided to eat in the school cafeteria today. Having finished their respective meals, they went to put the dishes away. This was the perfect time for a private discussion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, she did invite you on a date, so I wouldn't say that the chances are low."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She even kissed you on the forehead, right? Girls wouldn't do that with a boy they hate. Leaving out the possibility that she is Cinderella, she still seems quite fond of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not so sure. Maybe she's just looking up to me as her Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki… Really, just how negative can you be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like a prince with no confidence…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a reference to the protagonist of a film I watched."</p>
<p class="null-p">The bad kind of protagonist who could never make up his mind when it really counted. Maybe both Keiki and that prince were pretty similar. Like, being unable to move forward when it really counted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Keiki's phone vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An email from Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, speak of the devil. What's it say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a few button presses, he opened the email.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Yuika has something important to talk about. After school, can you come to the storage room of the library?'</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki's movements came to a sudden stop, Shouma glanced over from the opposite seat and let out a laugh, saying, "Would you look at that?" "Well, Akiyama-san, what doth thou thinkest about this email?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well well, Kiryuu-san. Yon email looks like a flag for a confession in my eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-So you think so too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha. Now that it's come to this, you have to pull through to the end, Kiryuu-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they had started goofing around a bit, both of them shared the same opinion. That this mail was clearly a flag. That 'something important' part must be related to love. This must be one of those 'after-school confession' events.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san might actually be your Cinderella. Maybe she decided to tell you in person now because the love letter didn't work out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Whatever shall I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, please stop talking like that. She must've mustered up a lot of courage to send you that email."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the very least, you should go and listen to what she has to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I think you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't have the choice of not going, after all. His kouhai had the courage to send that email. Not moving his legs now because he had no confidence would make him a failure of a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though he didn't have any confidence, the prince tried his best until the very end."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided that he would find out the identity of the girl who sent him the love letter. He wanted to find that girl who had admitted her feelings for Keiki. If they were to become a couple, Keiki couldn't be happier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go talk with Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">To find out. And, if she really was Cinderella, to hug her as much as he liked.</p>
<p class="null-p">After school. Keiki headed towards the room where Yuika was waiting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having arrived, he knocked on the door and a response came back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having gotten permission, he opened the door and entered the dusty storage room. Yuika was standing in front of a bookshelf, waiting for the boy she had called for to arrive. As her blonde hair was slightly wavering, she called out the boy's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai. You… came."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like you asked."</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides Yuika and Keiki, no one was present inside the storage room. Yuika slightly opened her mouth and her cheeks started to flush.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has something important to talk about. Will you listen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, of course. Please, tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She put one hand on her modest chest, taking a deep breath and following with an "Actually…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thinks of Keiki-senpai as a nice person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You gently taught Yuika how to work as a library committee member, you were extremely kind on our date yesterday, you helped Yuika out when she was in trouble, making her think of you as reliable and someone worth looking up to. Yuika thought that it would be nice… if you were to only look at her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her trying to put her feelings into words, a fire started burning inside Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why… Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With watery eyes, she looked up at him. Her expression looked like an angel that could make any member of the opposite sex a captive. And, she said the following words with determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, Yuika wants you to become her slave!" "……………………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a feeling like the person in front of him had changed. It was an unreasonable feeling, like wanting to buy some sweets from a store but ending up trapped in a cage with a lion. That unreasonable feeling was what Keiki felt after hearing the blonde-haired kouhai's words. A completely unreasonable confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Did I mishear that just now? Yuika-chan, did you say that you want me to become your slave?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, she said that. Loud and clear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why won't you deny that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If she had used the words 'Boyfriend' or 'Lover', there wouldn't have been any problem at all, but it seems like no matter how much Keiki had wished to have misunderstood her, he didn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Yuika-chan, are you serious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that a no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm just a bit lost right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Keiki's response, Yuika slightly titled her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You would become a slave to a cute girl like Yuika, right? A lot of boys would see that as a reward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was at a loss for words. No matter how much he tried, he couldn't think of anything to say. He wondered if the person in front of him really was Koga Yuika. The more she said, the more she drifted away from the image he had of her. So much so that he might've actually believed her if she said that she was an impostor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm, that's right. As your master, Yuika has to give you a fitting reward… Ah, that's right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mumbling something to herself, she then put one finger into the air with a "Nice idea!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's do it like this. If Senpai were to become Yuika's slave, she would give Senpai a valued possession of hers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A valued possession?" Keiki responded without thinking as Yuika grinned.</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting both her hands up her skirt, she pulled them down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…? H-Hey, what are you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu fu, you've gotten red. How cute…" With cute moments, she did something that a normal boy like Keiki was never supposed to see in person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go," She said and stretched out her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like she was giving him a present. And what she handed him were the pink panties she had been wearing until this very moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, what is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Freshly-worn panties of a girl. Boys are happy to get stuff like this, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only a pervert would be happy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu. To talk back to his master, what a bad puppy," Muttering these words, she closed in on Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">With both hands, she pushed him down. A complete surprise attack. Even though she wouldn't have been able to do that in a normal situation, Keiki's body was still weak from the shock he had received a few moments prior. With him collapsed on the floor, Yuika sat down on top of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu……That's no good, you know? A slave has to listen to his master's words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems that you need a proper scolding," Saying that, she pushed her panties inside Keiki's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh?! Mmmmmmmmmmm----?!?!?!?" Feeling them inside his mouth, he wanted to let out a scream, but found himself unable to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, what a lovely face. Are you happy to get a taste of Yuika's worn panties?" Reflected in Keiki's watery eyes was the angel-like smile of Yuika, "Ahh, how wonderful… so wonderful, Senpai. Being pushed down by a small girl, being fed her panties… seeing this embarrassed Senpai, Yuika is starting to shiver from excitement."</p>
<p class="null-p">With her fingers on her lips and her cheeks slightly flushed, she had a bewitching smile on her face. Seeing that face sent shivers down Keiki's spine. Koga Yuika isn't just cute, she has an evil witch sleeping inside of her!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do not be afraid, Senpai. If you become Yuika's slave, she will gently discipline you," She said such a terrifying phrase with her usual cute voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that phrase didn't reach Keiki's ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----, -------, -------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? Huh? Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika shook Keiki's body, but it was already too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">So this is how I'm going to die? How embarrassing……I don't want to die while I'm choking on panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">While his consciousness was being pulled far away, that's what Keiki thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">The beautiful Senpai he looked up to.</p>
<p class="null-p">The honest and cute Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">But they weren't just that.</p>
<p class="null-p">His Senpai asked him to become her owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">His Kouhai was a yandere-type queen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of these beautiful and cute girls had a hidden dark side that shouldn't exist. They were like coins, with two different sides.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe this is the cold truth of this world?</p>
<p class="null-p">With these thoughts, the panties that filled his mouth cut off his oxygen supply and the whole world went black. </p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: My Senpai And Kouhai Are Fighting Way Too Much </p>
<p class="null-p">It was after class inside the storage room of the library. In this room, Kiryuu Keiki was pushed down by a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai…" What came out of her cute lips was that sweet voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">With flushed cheeks and watery eyes, she looked at Keiki. Her short, golden hair made her look like a Westerner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will give Keiki-senpai one of her treasures."</p>
<p class="null-p">What she had in her hand was a pink-coloured pair of panties. Rolling these panties into a ball, she stuffed them into Keiki's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nngggguh!?" He couldn't manage to let out a scream due to the foreign object in his mouth, "Nguuuuuuuuuuuuh--!!!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the girl sitting on his stomach wasn't kind enough to release him from his suffering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Are Yuika's freshly-worn panties delicious?" Laughing like an angel, she said these terrifying words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--‐Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With rough breathing, Keiki glanced around at the room. The TV and the desk. The bookshelf and the sideboard. His own clothes hanging on the wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">The alarm clock that Mizuha gave him next to his pillow. There was no doubt that this was his own room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-A dream, huh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling the sweat on his forehead, he accepted that this was indeed real.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a bad dream…" Although he would've loved to call it a nightmare, the fact that the content of his dream had actually happened made it impossible to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">Four days prior, Keiki's cute Kouhai stuffed her panties into his mouth inside the school's library. A truly painful experience, evoking a deep trauma inside of him. So much so that he kept reliving that scene inside his dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was getting up from the bed, he heard a soft knock from the door, which opened up soon after.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, are you awake?" The one who showed her face was Mizuha, wearing an apron. She was Keiki's little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you are awake. Mornin', Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mornin'. Mizuha wearing her apron is the cutest person in the world." "Eh, is that so? Really now, Nii-san is such a siscon," She smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Mizuha like this made Keiki feel better after that horrible dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's how cute she is. So unbelievably cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Nii-san, I heard a loud scream before; were you having a bad dream?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah… something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had relived the scene where his female Kouhai put her freshly-worn panties into his mouth. But there was no way that he could just tell her that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She might assume that he just had a screw loose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if it's nothing, then how about you prepare for school? Breakfast is already done."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_11.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"School…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki was a high school student. Today was just another Friday, so of course he had school. But if he were to go to class, he might bump into the Kouhai that forced him to eat her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Koga Yuika - just remembering that name nearly triggered his PTSD. And that nightmare from before certainly didn't help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't feel like going to school today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it something serious? Or are you just pretending?" "Pretending," His honest answer made her smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then no."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said this like a wife saying no to one of her husband's crazy ideas. She really didn't mince words, even towards her big brother.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Four days before, Keiki had been confessed to by Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">After losing consciousness, he had awoken inside the nurse's office. Yuika had told some sort of lie to the teacher, and it seemed that the teacher had carried Keiki here. Yuika had said that Keiki had collapsed while he was being confessed to.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being deceived by that, the teacher said things to Keiki like 'Being confessed to by such a beauty, you really are lucky!' but Keiki didn't find Yuika all that cute. Every person has a dark side to them. In that girl's case, she was a witch as far as Keiki was concerned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"- I'll be going this way then, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the house together with Mizuha, he walked with heavy feet when he separated from her. In a sleep-deprived state, he was currently standing in front of the shoe lockers. And he unconsciously muttered the following.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that not just Sayuki-senpai, but also Yuika-chan had such a dark side to her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wanting to make Keiki her owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wanting to make Keiki her slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So is Yuika-chan not my Cinderella after all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Telling your significant other to become your slave didn't feel like a normal thing for lovers to do. That left only one out of the three original Cinderella candidates.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So if it wasn't Sayuki-senpai or Yuika-chan, then that only leaves -"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Mornin', Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Good morning, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of the devil, the final candidate, wearing her brownish hair in a ponytail, was standing next to him. Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you spacing out for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just trying to come to terms with this hopeless reality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know what you're talking about," Responding with that, she took her shoes out of her locker.</p>
<p class="null-p">Following suit, Keiki did the same. However, there was something on top of his shoes. When he took it out, Keiki realized that it was a cute-looking bra.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-It's nothing!?" He hurriedly stuffed it back into his locker and took a deep breath, "Calm down… Calm down, me… This isn't the time to be panicking."</p>
<p class="null-p">Checking inside the locker once more, Keiki realized that were was a small note next to his shoes. Wondering who it was from, he took it out and opened it carefully so that Mao wouldn't see the content.</p>
<p class="null-p">Believe it or not, I do have some breasts, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">-Yuika</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, you've been really noisy this morning. What about Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person in question was, of course, his Kouhai. He could never let anyone see the things inside his locker right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was on the same level of danger as the Cinderella panties incident. If someone where to spot it, he would die. Socially.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell is she doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting a bra into a boy's locker? That's akin to terrorism. Even though she had done so without being caught, Keiki couldn't just accept this kind of bullying. He had to return them as fast as possible, not to mention have a proper conversation with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes ended, a boy and a girl met in an empty classroom. The victim with a bra in his possession, Kiryuu Keiki. And the terrorist Koga Yuika, having been called here with an email. The Kouhai was sitting at a desk, facing him with a huge grin on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being called over like this by Keiki-senpai makes Yuika really happy," And indeed, she really looked like she was happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So? What is this supposed to mean, Yuika-chan?" With these words, Keiki took out the bra and put it on top of the desk. It was the one that Yuika had put in Keiki's shoe locker. "What are you thinking, pulling a stunt like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you had fun playing with my panties, right, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Panties… Panties are scary… Panties are scary…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai? Your face isn't looking so good…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked "Are you okay?" by the person who inflicted the trauma on him was a new experience for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not really okay, I don't think… or rather, huh? You did that for such a cruel reason?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Yuika thought that this would be troublesome for Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really was! I thought that I would die! Socially!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, Yuika was hiding and watching you. Senpai's troubled face was so wonderful. Ahaha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't your character changing a bit too much?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There's gotta be a limit to how evil someone can be! She was starting to act like a completely different person. Girls really are scary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Senpai, you've been avoiding Yuika after that, haven't you? You haven't come to the library, and you haven't answered any of Yuika's emails. After you basically pressured Yuika into doing that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as she said, these past few days Keiki had been trying to avoid her. After what had happened, that shouldn't be so surprising. Although he knew that eventually meeting with her was an inevitability.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you can keep that bra as a present."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't need it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is one of Yuika's favourites, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care, so take it back already," He returned the bra to its rightful owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was already holding onto a pair of panties, so holding onto another dangerous item like that would raise the risk of being found out at home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, uhm, I sure hope that I'm wrong but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Under your uniform, you're not actually no-bra, are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly the room got quiet. And, inevitably, Keiki's gaze was drawn towards Yuika's chest region.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha?! What are you thinking about?!" She said as she hid her chest with her arms. Her face turned red from embarrassment, "Of course Yuika is wearing one! Senpai is so lewd! You pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to be told that by Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting her own bra into my shoe locker, stuffing her freshly-worn panties in my mouth…I think stuff like that makes her a bigger pervert that I could ever be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Compared to what you did to me, a no-bra shouldn't be too embarrassing," Keiki muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The girls in Yuika's class would immediately notice, wouldn't they? Yuika wouldn't give such a service to just anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you showed me your panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine because it's Senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For Yuika, Keiki-senpai is someone… special, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Special you say…" Being told this so directly was pretty embarrassing for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving special treatment from a girl would make any boy happy. "Keiki-senpai is the only one who Yuika wants to make into her slave."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. I'm not happy about that at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">All the hopes he had found for a fleeting moment were immediately lost again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. Yuika wanted to give something to Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika took a book out of her bag and handed it to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the book we were talking about before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah, yeah. Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the book that Yuika offered to lend him when they went on their date. Although Keiki completely forgot about it, it seemed like Yuika had remembered her promise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also… this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm? This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next thing she handed him was a sketchbook. When he opened it, he saw a cute illustration of a princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A picture book? Did you make this, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, She just finished it recently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, you wanted to become a picture book author."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will you read it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I was interested in it anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">Drawn in that sketchbook was what looked like a children's story.</p>
<p class="null-p">'The shy princess'</p>
<p class="null-p">In a certain place, there was a shy princess. On a certain day, there was a party at the princess' castle. She invited the prince from the neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="null-p">That prince was kind and handsome, a really wonderful person. That is why the princess fell in love with the prince at first sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, because the princess was so shy, she couldn't confess to the prince.</p>
<p class="null-p">So the princess locked up the prince in her basement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Any reader would be overwhelmed by that sudden development. Keiki's fingers were slightly shaking as he turned the page.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place the prince was locked up in was the basement of the castle. The prince was captured by the princess' servants and brought down to said basement. Having awoken inside a pitch-black room, the prince turned towards the princess and screamed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you doing this, Princess? Please let me return to my own country!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the princess didn't do as the prince asked. She had finally gotten the perfect partner that she had always wished for, so there was no way she would let him go now.</p>
<p class="null-p">The princess locked the door to the basement, leaving no way for the prince to escape. The prince could no longer return to his own country.</p>
<p class="null-p">From then on, he would live with the shy princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after that day, the prince's 'training' started.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Something like that. After that, the training started, but the content was actually pretty crazy. Even the pictures were as hardcore as the story. After he was confined in the basement, the prince started to grow accustomed to the training and slowly became the princess' slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was clearly an age-restricted type of work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How was it, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyyiii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The relationship of the two of them makes your heart beat faster, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It did make my heart beat faster, but probably for a different reason than Yuika's."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the prince started smiling while the princess was whipping his butt, Keiki stopped reading.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, this is it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is what Yuika wants our relationship to be like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You want to hit me on the butt with a whip?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that was just fiction… Though if Keiki-senpai wishes for it, then Yuika wouldn't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no way in hell that I would ever wish for something like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you might end up actually enjoying being Yuika's slave, just like the prince."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if I would!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you hate the thought of becoming Yuika's slave that much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anybody would hate becoming someone's slave!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about becoming Yuika's butler?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Butler?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now she was saying something else weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you think about it, butlers also serve their masters just like slaves do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's pretty rude towards all the butlers out there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Yuika just said that as an example, so how about you train and gather some experience?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Train? As a butler?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, we will do a butler training session."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Butler training session, huh… What exactly would that entail?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"First should be… this, probably," She took off her shoes and sat down on top of the desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">After also taking off her knee-socks, her panties were barely visible as she stretched out her radiant bare leg towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, Senpai. No need to hold back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm…What is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please kneel down and lick Yuika's foot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly decline!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A normal person's response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I don't think that licking their master's feet is the job of a butler, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nooo, first-class butlers would do anything for their masters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's gotta be a lie…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why don't you kiss Yuika's foot to start with?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that this is a pretty high hurdle that you consider a start! And I'm also really not into all of that, so you're forcing me to do the impossible!" "Don't worry, Senpai. Yuika will change you. Yes, it will be such a complete change that you will eventually start listening to Yuika's orders - okay?" Her eyes were the same as when she had confessed to him in the storage room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling that terror throughout his entire body, Keiki immediately stood up from his seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm not feeling so well, so I will excuse myself for now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, Senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not paying any attention to her voice, he ran away from that classroom. As he grabbed his bag, he was surprised at his own running speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Yuika will not give up, you know! She will definitely make you her slave!" Yuika called after him with a cute voice, but with scary words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, let's just go home. As fast as possible. I need to flirt to my heart's content with Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Deciding that he would leave tomorrow's problems to his future self, he walked home. Tonight, he planned on being spoiled by his little sister. Eating his little sister's delicious dinner, watching TV together, laughing about the dumbest things. For now, he just wanted to heal his wounded heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having decided on that, he walked towards the entrance of the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he still wasn't able to go home that easily. There was something else in his shoe locker that wasn't shoes. Laying on top of his shoes was a single picture. Shown on that picture was a big enough scandal to prevent him from leaving. The picture was of Kiryuu Keiki, lying topless on a tatami mat, with Yokihara Sayuki snuggling up next to him, wearing nothing but a single t-shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad… bad in a different way than the bra was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This clearly looked like an after-sex selfie. On the back of the photo, there was something written with beautiful handwriting.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Come to the clubroom immediately. If you don't, I'll leak this photo online, with your real name added to it.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no, you can't just upload that online…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once you put something online, you can never truly delete it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And when did she even take that picture…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After searching around in this memories, Keiki thought of one possible time when she could've taken it. Soon after he became a second year, there was one time when he fell asleep inside the clubroom. Unguarded sleep is a weakness that all living beings share. Of course, humans are no exception to this rule. And Sayuki had used that chance for her own benefit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, this looks exactly like an after-sex selfie… if this were to get leaked…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rumours would spread immediately, and once they made their rounds, it would he hard to clear them up. And, it wouldn't be too long before people would find out that Keiki was forced into the role of master for a master-pet relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not good. I have to prevent that at all costs."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki wants to become Keiki's pet. She confessed that she wanted him to become her master. However, Keiki still didn't want that at all. Never, not at all, not one bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, the girl didn't give up just yet, and had continued her approach. And that picture was probably just one way of approaching Keiki. Although Keiki really didn't like the feeling of it, he couldn't ignore that picture. That's why he gave in and made his way towards the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the second floor of the building, Keiki was standing in front of the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, it's been a little while since I came here last."</p>
<p class="null-p">He hadn't come to the clubroom since he had learned of Sayuki's true nature.</p>
<p class="null-p">After knocking softly, he received an answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse- meeeee?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened the door, there was a maid waiting for him. Be it on the shoulders or on the legs, it was a costume with a lot of exposure. Her hands were locked together behind her back with handcuffs, her chest was almost bursting out of her clothes, and a dog collar was fastened around her neck as she sat on the floor. The girl herself merely stared at her guest with shining, diamond-like eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome home, master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thud</p>
<p class="null-p">The master immediately closed the door again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yup, let's go home. Back to my own world."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki was trying to run away from this cruel reality, the door opened and the cute sulking face of the maid peeked out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To leave three seconds after you arrive - how cruel of you, master."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The only cruel thing is your terrible taste, Senpai. And I'm not your master, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">The identity of this maid was Sayuki, of course.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing a skirt that barely covered her panties, not even hiding her thighs. And she had her hair in a ponytail. This masochistic girl really wasn't holding back at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How rude… But I don't dislike that attitude, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is wrong with this person…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">How did she manage to open the door with her handcuffs on?</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, it would be bad to let such an erotic maid out into the hallway. After pondering about it for a moment, he decided to push her back into the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? Since when did this clubroom become a maid cafe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I borrowed a book the other day, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, 'The right way to keep a pet dog' or something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that. After reading it, I thought that maybe a maid might be a good idea for a pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second, please… I can't keep up with what you're telling me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, listen to the end, will you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was having trouble doing just that. With her hands cuffed together behind her back, her chest was pushed out even more than usual, which was giving Keiki immense trouble figuring out where to look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so, to investigate, I went to a maid cafe. From the maids working there, I got a good impression. Despite lustful gazes from the opposite gender, and despite the sexual harassment, they just smiled in response and kept serving their masters, like obedient dogs. Seeing that really moved me. So much so that I decided that I had no other option but to try it myself - And that's why I tried becoming a maid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You tried becoming a maid, you say…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, is the order a maid?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have only one order. Please change immediately. Those clothes are a nogo, in a lot of ways."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like to do that, but I need the key to open these handcuffs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Key? If that's the case, then I'll open them for you. Where did you put the key?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a bit hard to say…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I was holding it between my lips and trying to put it on top of the desk, I accidentally dropped it into my cleavage…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The key was supposedly between her two big melons, which were pressed together by the maid costume. And they had completely swallowed it up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, will you grab between my breasts and take the key out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a moment! That's pretty bad, isn't it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. You have my consent. I won't call the police afterwards or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That comment just makes me more nervous, though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The comment came from the person that took such a dangerous photo, after all. If she somehow managed to get a picture of Keiki retrieving the key, it wouldn't just be his school life that would be officially over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right, I'll go and call another girl-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Keiki-kun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was about to take out his phone as that sad-sounding voice stopped him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'd really prefer it if you hurried up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She's acting weird? Her voice was shaking, and taking a closer look, her eyes were starting to get watery and she started fidgeting with her legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm at my limit… uhm… I would really like to go to the toilet…"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_12.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell are you even doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In his mind, the image of the person that he looked up to completely crumbled into pieces. Maybe Tokihara Sayuki was just an idiot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I do in this situation…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Calling for a female acquaintance would take too long at this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">That means he had to choose between two awful choices:</p>
<p class="null-p">Grabbing the key out of her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching the girl wet herself inside the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what he chose, what awaited him was a difficult path. And the option that the young boy chose was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is my first time, so please be gentle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you be quiet for a second?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm… Ah, Ahnn…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai - Don't let out such a weird voice!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the maid was freed from the handcuffs. Under the condition that the photo would be deleted, of course. And Sayuki's breasts were just as soft as they looked. But Keiki was an adolescent boy, after all, so that's why- "Calm down! Calm down, my 'son'!!!!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Sayuki went to the toilet, Keiki tried his best to calm down his awakened son in his pants.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having finished her business, she changed back into a normal female high school student. Although she had dashed off while wearing her maid clothes, fortunately nobody saw her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If someone happened to see me, I'd just call it a 'costume for the culture festival'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You would definitely get in trouble if you were to wear such a costume at the culture festival. And the culture festival is still quite a ways off, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Sayuki were sitting in their respective seats and were having a useless conversation like usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What would've happened if I hadn't come to free you from your handcuffs?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In addition to wearing a maid costume with handcuffs to my hands, it would've turned into a 'wetting yourself in a maid costume with handcuffs' incident."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be enough to get you expelled, alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. But Keiki-kun came for me," She had a soft smile on her face as she moved next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting the chair she was sitting on right next to him, she rested her head on his shoulders. Completely normally, as if they were lovers. Keiki was overwhelmed by her sweet aroma and her cuteness, and couldn't bring himself to immediately push her away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm…Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was wondering this before while we were at the library, but isn't your skinship a bit extreme?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's marking. I'm doing this so that others know that you belong to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you a dog or what…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. I am Keiki-kun's bitch, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't remember adopting a dog or a Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cruel! But that cold gaze also feels pretty good-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what were you planning on doing when you used that picture to call me here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Keiki's question, she lifted up her head from his shoulders and looked straight at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You won't come meet me if I don't give you a reason to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You used to always came here on your own accord. Are you already fed up with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To throw away such a good woman… Keiki-kun really is a cruel man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a moment, why does it sound like I'm the bad one here?!" Being falsely charged is really scary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't have any special reason. Just, as master's pet, I got nervous after not seeing him for such a long time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai……"</p>
<p class="null-p">To Keiki, it sounded like she was lonely. Maybe that's why her skinship is so extreme right now, he thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Earlier, I happened to hear some second year boys talking about how they wanted their first time to be with me-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That topic change is kind of abrupt, don't you think?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, just like Keiki, a lot of boys looked up to her because of her beauty and nice style.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like I'm really popular with the boys. Night after night, in my fantasies, they keep doing what they want with me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of pervert are you, really…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might sound arrogant coming from me, but I'm confident in my brush handling skills, you know? What was it… 'A good workman does not blame his tools', right? That's why I'm sure that I can handle a boy's brush too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of analogy is that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing her Kouhai's response, Sayuki's laugh resounded right next to his ear. She then put her white hand on his chest and leaned in close to his ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's Keiki-kun… I might even do it for you, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">These words were like a bomb for Keiki. A sweet, tempting bomb that could completely destroy a boy's logical thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Keiki was an adolescent boy too. It would be a lie if he said that he didn't have any interest in that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to be upfront with you… I am a pretty horny woman."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Every night, I have sexual fantasies about Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you telling me that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why…if Keiki-kun were to become my master, I would give you both my body and my heart." "B-Both body and heart?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I will do everything you want. Even things you wouldn't be able to do with other women. No matter what you wish for, Keiki-kun. You can do whatever you want, wherever you want- yeah?" As if to entice him, she lifted up her breasts with both her arms. Seeing that, Keiki wasn't able to look away. Being obviously happy because of her Kouhai's reaction, she had a more temping expression as she continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun… will you be my master?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words held the same meaning as a confession. Completely uncertain what he would do, a meeting convened inside his mind, the members being an angel and a devil.</p>
<p class="null-p">Devil Cake-kun: "Will you make the beautiful, big-breasted Senpai your pet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Angel Cake-kun: "No, that's not good. It's impossible to make a girl your pet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Devil Cake-kun: "But she will let you do any erotic things you want, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Angel Cake-kun: "T-That's……gulp…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Devil Cake-kun: "Her breasts where so soft, right? They're the best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Angel Cake-kun: "W-Well, I would be lying if I said that they weren't…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Devil Cake-kun: "She'll let you do anything with those big breasts, you know? Isn't that awesome?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Angel Cake-kun: "………That might be pretty awesome, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In his heart, it felt like the angel had been pushed away. He probably gave in to the sweet whispering of the devil. All of the boy's instincts where screaming 'Go!'. However-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's eyes opened wide after hearing Keiki's response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like that is impossible without loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's scream resounded inside the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Doing erotic stuff without love is no good.' -That sense of virtue is enough to clearly label oneself a virgin, but for a boy with zero experience, that reaction would be normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this particular instance, Sayuki would be the abnormal one, not Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-I won't give up, you know! I'll definitely make Keiki my master!" As Keiki ran away, that voice entered his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika and Sayuki. Keiki had no idea why they were both so obsessed with a boring boy like him. What he did know was one thing. Both Yuika and</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki weren't going to give up on him anytime soon…</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">A new week and a new Monday. Lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having finished eating their lunch in the classroom, Keiki and Shouma were sitting next to the classroom windows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, how's it going with your Cinderella search?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? W-Well… yeah, the love letter, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you forget about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but lately a lot of stuff has been on my mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">To be fair, it was too much for him, which is why the love letter had completely slipped his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the beginning of May, an unknown girl had left the love letter inside the clubroom after they finished cleaning it. In addition, she had left a pair of panties along with it, which is where the name 'Cinderella' originated from. After that, Keiki had made it his goal to find out the identity of the girl and get his first girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the circumstances, Keiki could lower the amount of possible candidates to four. However, one of them was Keiki's little sister, so he had removed her from the very beginning. With that, he decided to search for his Cinderella, but because of the incidents with his Senpai and Kouhai, he hadn't had any time recently to think about it at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You did investigate Tokihara-senpai and Koga-san, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. But I don't think that either of them are Cinderella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I can't say for sure but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be hard to believe that either Tokihara Sayuki or Koga Yuika had any romantic feelings for Keiki. The only reason they approached Keiki was because one of them wanted him to become her 'Master' and the other wanted him to become her 'Slave'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that would only leave one candidate. There were four girls present at the cleaning operation, and not counting Mizuha makes it three. And if you say that both Tokihara-senpai and Koga-san probably aren't Cinderella, then that only leaves-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cutting off his words like that, he focused his gaze towards the middle of the classroom. Sitting there was a girl with reddish-brown hair. "That leaves one candidate, you say… Nanjou, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it can't be anyone other than Mao-chan, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Nanjou is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd say that the possibility is pretty high. From time to time, it looks like she's staring at you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You haven't noticed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back on it, it's true that he had felt Mao's gaze from time to time. Like when he was talking with Shouma for example. Or before he facially received that volleyball. But since she immediately averted her eyes if they happened to meet with his, Keiki just thought that it was a coincidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, rather than me, isn't she looking at you, Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because she never looks at me when I'm alone. However, when you're with me, she always has a soft expression, or her cheeks are slightly flushed. It's like she's a young maiden in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou… likes me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They happened to be seat neighbours in their first year, and after that, they just talked normally from time to time, like friends. However, if Sayuki and Yuika weren't Cinderella, that would only leave Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki glanced towards Mao. She had headphones in her ears and was reading a book. That sight was something completely normal for her. It was true that she talked with Keiki or Shouma from time to time, but there were times when she was completely disinterested. Almost like a cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he looked at heir reddish-brown hair, she seemed to notice his gaze and turned around. When their eyes met, she immediately looked away with a displeased expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels like she's always just glaring at me. In what world is that the face of a maiden in love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Weird. Maybe it's her day of the month?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better drop that topic right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma really had no delicacy at all, talking about the physiology of a classmate like that. But Keiki still wondered why she looked so pissed from time to time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki, did you do anything to upset her lately?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, I haven't even talked to her today."</p>
<p class="null-p">The only things that had happened to Keiki that day were being hugged from behind by Sayuki as he walked to school that morning and being grabbed from the side by Yuika as he went to the science room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked to become a girl's owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked to accept a girl becoming his owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being busy with these two girls, Keiki hadn't had the time to communicate with Mao at all. Of course, he didn't do anything that could upset her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't get girls sometimes……" Like Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl's heart was too complicated to understand for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If only there were a way to calculate a girl's thoughts with math……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was still lost on the identity of his Cinderella, the prince thought so.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day after class. Having been called to the clubroom once more by Sayuki, he was on his way there. Although he certainly didn't feel comfortable about it, he didn't want to leave her alone. And he was afraid that she might spread another picture she took. As he walked down the hallway, his view went black suddenly. And right after, a voice saying "Guess who it is~" spoke from behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Judging from that voice, it's gotta be Yuika-chan, right? Is it blindfold play today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he went to pull her hands away from his face, his Kouhai screamed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, don't, Keiki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is naked right now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To seduce Keiki-senpai, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up already and put on some clothes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika would really like to do that, but if she let go of Keiki-senpai's face, he would be able to see. She did say that she wanted to seduce Senpai, but being seen butt-naked would be too embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you really think this through?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has her clothes in this empty classroom, so please follow her. She'll even put her hands away… so if you really want to see, you can open your eyes. But Yuika will have you take responsibility for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Responsibility is scary, so I'll gladly keep my eyes shut."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, right this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, Yuika separated her hands from Keiki's head. As he kept his eyes shut, she pulled him by the hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, Senpai. Here's a chair, so please sit down here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He did as he was told, although the cold feeling of the chair surprised him a bit. In that moment, he felt that both of his hands were being pulled behind the chair's back. And then, it felt like some kind of string was being wound around his wrists-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uhm, Yuika-chan? Are you tying me up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just your imagination?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's clearly a lie, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling the danger through his entire body, he involuntarily opened his eyes. In the middle of his view, there was a blonde-haired beauty, properly wearing her uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You put on your clothes pretty fast, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if Yuika would walk around the hallway naked," Answered the little witch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently Keiki had been deceived by this girl. The room he was dragged into was an old classroom that wasn't used anymore. And just as he had suspected, Keiki was sitting on a chair in the middle of that classroom, his hands tied up behind the chair's back. Not to mention his legs were tied up as tightly as his arms. Now he couldn't run away anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And? Where did you plan on going, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Well, I wanted to attend the calligraphy clubroom today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Calligraphy clubroom… huh? Is that so…" She returned a cold gaze,</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not good. To leave Yuika alone and go meet that Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By 'Witch-senpai,' you mean Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That big-breasted monster, the name 'Witch-senpai' fits her perfectly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big-breasted monster……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than that, the problem is that you prioritize that Witch-senpai over your cute Yuika. A slave isn't allowed to cheat, you know? Don't you think that some punishment is necessary?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Punishment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yuika started snickering, she took off her shoes and socks. And just like before, she stretched out a leg towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, kiss Yuika's foot. And swear to give Yuika both your body and mind, for all eternity. With that, you will finally become Yuika's slave," She said with a bewitching smile and flushed cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't listen, Yuika will be the one to kiss you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But not on the cheek or on the forehead. On your lips, of course. It's probably Keiki-senpai's first time, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Wai-?! Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please choose. Kiss Yuika's foot, or have your first kiss stolen by Yuika-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, wait?! Yuika-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Yuika will not wait," With these words, she closed her eyes and brought her beautiful face closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyelashes were insanely long. Her cheeks were so cute. Her lips were as beautiful as a flower, completely robbing Keiki of the strength to resist what she was about to do. On the contrary, he had started looking forward to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their soft breaths were starting to intermingle, and in the moment when their lips were about to overlap-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-That's enough!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person that spoke these words was a black-haired beauty. Understanding the situation inside the classroom in an instant, Sayuki threw Yuika a sharp gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really can't let my guard down for one moment. You really are a thieving cat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's this dog-like smell here? Oh, it's you, Tokihara-senpai. How did you know that we were here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my hobby to stalk Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm joking. Keiki-kun was late so I came to check on him, and then I heard your voices from outside," With these words, she walked closer to the chair Keiki was sitting on and started untying him from the chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't go interfering with our sweet time together! Keiki-senpai belongs to Yuika!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since when, I wonder. Actually, I belong to Keiki-kun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, can you please keep quiet for a second?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cruel, Keiki-kun. Even though I came to save you, you treat me like a hindrance… Ahhh, but that still feels good in its own way, so it's not a problem. On the contrary, you should always treat me like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person is completely lost… I have to do something fast or else…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a hopeless masochist after all, so no matter what Keiki would say, it would only turn into pleasure for her. However, after she had freed him, she turned to face Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you really acted all cute in front of Keiki-kun. Wanting him to become your slave, huh? What a bad hobby."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't want to be told that by someone who wanted to become</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki-senpai's pet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like sparks were flying between the two of them. Like the sun and moon, their personality and way of thinking were completely different, resulting in a fight every time they met in front of the young boy. Having been freed from his shackles, Keiki had a big question mark on top of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? Both of you knew each other's true nature?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When Yuika first met Tokihara-senpai, she told Yuika that 'I will make</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki-kun my master so you'd better give up', you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I first met her, I realized that she was clearly aiming for Keiki-kun. Although the blind Keiki-kun might not have realized it, she couldn't fool me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's why your relationship was always so bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That explained their behaviour every time they met. Though it really didn't matter at this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I didn't expect that you wanted to make Keiki-kun your slave."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't have anything to do with Tokihara-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It does. Keiki-kun will be the one to become my master after all. That's why I won't give that position to any other girl," Sayuki glared at Yuika as she grabbed Keiki's right arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No! Keiki-senpai belongs to Yuika!" Yuika screamed as she grabbed Keiki's left arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with this situation…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Some might call this the 'A flower in both hands' situation but there was a big difference here. One side wants him to become her master, the other side wants him to become her slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, a boy would be pretty happy being surrounded by girls like this, but somehow I just feel like crying. So how should I get rid of them now…?</p>
<p class="null-p">However, as Keiki was thinking about what to do, another voice called out in the empty classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you people doing…?" That cold sounding voice belonged to the reddish-brown haired student that Keiki was pretty familiar with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he could even ask what she was doing there, she slowly entered the room. Without paying any attention to the gazes of Sayuki and Yuika, she walked right in front of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come with me for a sec, Kiryuu," That was all she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking Keiki's hand, she pulled him with her away from that place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the classroom behind them, they stopped in the hallway of the second floor, with no one else around. As she let go of Keiki's hand, he realized that she had a face unlike any that he had ever seen on her. Like she was crying, but still angry. A lot of different emotions were mixed up in that expression. That might've even been the first time he'd seen her real emotions written on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nanjou…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't hold back anymore… I can't put up with it any longer…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-About what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu is not allowed to be friendly with other girls!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You keep staring at Tokihara-senpai's breasts, and you're always so nice to Yuika. You even had a lewd expression on your face as they were clinging to you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that I had such an expression on my face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe he had gotten a bit excited because of the feeling of their breasts. At least, it seemed that Mao had interpreted it that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why would you be mad about that, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! T-That's…" Her cheeks flushed as Keiki asked her that, "Uhm… that's… well…" She tried her best to search for some words, but when she didn't manage to do so, she just glared at Keiki. "W-When I say that you're not allowed to, you're not allowed to!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You idiot! When you're together with other girls, it hurts me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the first time he'd seen her so aggravated. So when Keiki is with Sayuki and Yuika, Mao is in this much pain?</p>
<p class="null-p">Might it be that? Seeing Keiki in that situation just now, being surrounded by girls and looking all lovey-dovey, might this feeling she had while seeing that be… jealousy?</p>
<p class="null-p">That would certainly explain her reaction. And it looked like these were her honest feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So Nanjou really is…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was well aware that his classmate had tsundere tendencies. Thinking back on it, she was always very kind to him. When he took that volleyball to the face, she watched over him until he woke up. When he was feeling down because Sayuki kept running away, she gave him the push he needed. Even though her words might've been a bit harsh from time to time, her actions showed pure goodwill.</p>
<p class="null-p">What if she acted like that because she had feelings for Keiki? What if she was the Cinderella he had been searching for all this time?</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just imagining it made his face feel hot. Because - he couldn't find any logical reason that the girl in front of him couldn't be his Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu, you idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">The last Cinderella candidate muttered a weak "Idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, in this verbal abuse, there seemed to be some other feeling besides irritation.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: A Cruel Devil's Thesis</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after Keiki enrolled into high school, a homeroom started where everyone would have the opportunity to join a committee. Regardless of committee, there weren't many students that took initiative. The library committee especially had the image of being rather simple, so there weren't a lot of students that volunteered to join out of their own free will. Because of that, one girl had bad luck that day when the lottery was drawn. Said girl was Keiki's redheaded seat neighbour. With loose clothes and a short skirt, she had a rather modern style and atmosphere. Said girl always looked very displeased, and her good-looking face always had a cold gaze on it. However, when she returned from the lottery that day, she was completely different.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was crying like the world would end the next day. Because she looked so extremely troubled, Keiki had talked to her. And that was the trigger that caused Keiki to become a member of the library committee. It was the first time that Keiki had exchanged words with his brownish-red haired classmate, Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The next morning, Keiki happened to meet Mao in front of the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The gods really are harsh. Just when their relationship got a bit weird, the gods made them appear on front of the other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mornin', Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah, good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">Exchanging a short greeting, the girl took out her own indoor shoes. That expression she showed yesterday was nowhere to be found. She was wearing a small amount of make-up and her hair was put together in a modern style. Her face was as beautiful as ever, but the atmosphere around her was a bit different, like every time she took a breath there was a thorn inside her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday, Mao told Keiki that he shouldn't get too close to other girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he would've really liked to know her reasoning behind it, he couldn't find the right words to achieve that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, good morning!" The voice that cut through the heavy atmosphere sounded very energetic.</p>
<p class="null-p">The person greeting him was the blonde-haired Kouhai he was all too familiar with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mao-senpai is also here. Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mornin'… I'll be going on ahead," Being greeted by her Kouhai, the girl walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking at the girl's back with her blue eyes, Yuika looked up at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell Yuika… did something happen between Keiki-senpai and Maosenpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does it look like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really does. It's probably because of Yuika…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not just Yuika-chan, to be precise."</p>
<p class="null-p">There's another person accountable in this case. Of course, it was the longhaired, big-breasted Senpai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has to apologize for yesterday. It seems like she went a bit too far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. As long as you're reflecting on it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah but, Yuika will not give up on Keiki-senpai, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If at all possible, I would rather you gave up."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason or another, Yuika became interested in Keiki and now she wanted him to become her slave. However, Keiki didn't have the slightest interest of becoming the girl's slave. And like this, they would never see eye to eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai and Mao-senpai really are close."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Every time Yuika sees Mao-senpai on school grounds, she always has this sulking expression on her face, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… might be the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she's in the classroom, Mao just sits in her seat without talking to anyone. It's not like she's deliberately acting hostile, but she clearly doesn't go out of her way to start conversations with other people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But every time she's with Keiki-senpai, she looks like she's having fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika thought this before during the cleaning operation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Nanjou can be a bit moody sometimes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… does Mao-senpai feel that way towards Keiki-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cough Well… it would be best to hurry and make up with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it? You look so surprised."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I just thought that you were being strangely nice to me even though you want me to become your slave…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you don't know, Keiki-senpai?" She said as she turned around on the spot, making her skirt flutter, "As a proper master, Yuika has to alternate between the candy and the whip sometimes," Looking over her shoulder, she winked at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">With an angel-like smile, she said words befitting a witch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lunch break. Having finished eating his lunch, he received a perfectly timed email. The sender was Tokihara Sayuki. The content was 'Come to the clubroom immediately.'</p>
<p class="null-p">And, having arrived in front of her, he sat down, facing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why did you call me here during lunch break?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's about yesterday… was Nanjou-san mad after what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… I can't really say for sure…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought so. I happened to meet her in the hallway earlier and she looked even more mad than ever. It seems like your relationship with her has gotten worse because of me," She whimpered like a little puppy that did something bad, "I really reflected on it, you know? That incident with Koga-san yesterday… Nanjou-san happened to see all of it, right? It makes sense that it dampered her mood to see all of us like that. Like, me wanting to become Keiki-kun's pet, or Koga-san wanting to make Keiki-kun her slave… anyone would be a bit perplexed after seeing that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels really weird to hear you say something with that much common sense after all this time… But it's true that finding out about both of your real personalities in this harsh of a way might've been a bit too much for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I was always hiding my real personality all this time, after all. Nobody except Keiki-kun, Koga-san, and my family knew about me being a hardcore masochistic bitch."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So your family actually knows, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I told them, they said 'You'd better keep this a secret.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Figures."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just imagining how her parents must've felt made his heart hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, after that, I decided that I will pick out a private place to make my approach. I really don't want to trouble Keiki-kun, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I'll try to seduce him as best as I can in places where we can be alone together!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like the pets in the pet shop, I will show Keiki-kun my charm and make him choose me! 'Wow, now I really want to make Sayuki my pet,' something like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would rather drown in the depths of the ocean."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki stood up from her seat and brought her face closer to the table. A sweet smell and her puppy-like eyes made Keiki's heart beat faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please adopt me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, domesticate me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's getting worse?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, right? Master~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That cute voice won't help you. I have no plans whatsoever to make Senpai my pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nobody knows what the future will bring. There should be a worldline where I become Keiki-kun's pet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about you go over to that worldline right this instant?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't be having this much trouble if I could just take the train over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you were the one who brought it up……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I'll definitely win your heart in this worldline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So there's no option for you to give up on me, is there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course not?" She tilted her head in confusion as she grinned, looking like she found a small treasure of hers, "After all, Keiki-kun is the only person I want to be my master."</p>
<p class="null-p">That honest smile of hers was incredibly cute. It really was a pity that she was a super pervert that wanted to become another person's pet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, let's leave it at that for today. And I'll lay low for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? I thought you weren't going to give up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-san is Keiki-kun's important friend, right? Destroying my master's friendship would make me a disgrace of loyal dog after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would make a disgrace of a loyal dog after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you say it twice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of answering, she pointed her white finger at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So hurry up and make up with her already."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said it like she was pushing the back of a coward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yes, thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to that, Keiki felt much better now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whenever Keiki-kun's not with me, I enjoy myself thinking it's a neglection play."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can enjoy that for all of eternity."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, she's still very grown-up, worrying about her Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes. When homeroom ended, all of his fellow classmates left the classroom. While he calmly packed his things to prepare for the walk home, a red-haired girl resting her head on her desk entered Keiki's view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heey, Nanjou? Homeroom is already over, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm…? Ah, Kiryuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having checked on the source of the voice talking to her, she once more buried her face into her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine. Lately, I haven't been able to sleep very well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's none of your business."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it because of yesterday?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to talk about that right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I get it. But if you're having trouble about something, you can always ask me for advice, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll give me advice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we're friends after all, so of course I'd help you out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu…" She looked up at him, "Kiryuu and I are friends?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was I the only one who thought so?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, calm down. I was joking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't really laugh at that, though……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, thank you. It makes me happy that you think that," She had a soft smile on her face as she expressed her feelings verbally, "But you haven't been talking to me at all lately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh… that's… a lot of stuff happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, how about you make up for it now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Make up for it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we go to an arcade? It's been a long time, after all. Maybe together with Akiyama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The arcade, huh. We haven't been there for quite some time, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before, the three of them had gone there often, but Keiki had been a bit busy ever since the love letter incident.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today he didn't need to show his face in the calligraphy clubroom, and he didn't have any work with the library committee either. There was no reason to decline her invitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, this sound is like an explosion of nostalgia for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sometimes I really don't get Nanjou at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Likewise. This sound is nothing more than a pain in the ass," Shouma agreed to Keiki's opinion.</p>
<p class="null-p">As they were flooded with tons of different sounds, he had to speak in a louder voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouldn't it be fine to skip club practice from time to time, Akiyama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe. Ditching my club to play in an arcade really gets my excited."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, to think that you could get excited by anything besides little girls," Mao let out a cute laugh as she walked deeper into the arcade. "Let's do that one first, over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">What the girl was pointing at was a classic shooter game where you had to shoot the zombies that came at you. Mao and Shouma went first while Keiki watched them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As always, Nanjou's a goddess at this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Shouma wasn't half bad, he still couldn't reach Mao's level of skill. Or rather, since she was the one who wanted to go to the arcade, it made sense that she'd be basically a demon at every game possible. She was even good enough at fighting games (her favourite kind of game) to make an experienced player cry. Still, she also managed to clear the zombie shooting game with no damage taken. By the way, her partner Shouma was eaten halfway into the round.</p>
<p class="null-p">"C'mere Kiryuu. It's your turn."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah," Receiving the gun from Mao, he stood in front of the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Partner. Don't pull me down, will you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Likewise. I hope that you don't die halfway through the round like last time."</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, the game started. Screams and gunshots resounded through the battlefield, with blood as far as the eye could see. While Keiki and Shouma were shooting their hearts out, Mao watched them, seemingly having fun. Since it was a bit difficult without the monstrously strong Mao, it was no surprise when the game over screen appeared approximately ten minutes later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They really showed us, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That zombie with the big chainsaw was really tough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Exchanging these words, the boys put the guns back where they belonged and stepped away from the machine. In that moment, Keiki tripped over his own feet, making his body fall over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah," Shouma barely managed to catch him with his arm as he was about to fall over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah, thanks for that. It's been a while since I've played a game standing up like that, so I must've gotten a bit shaky in the legs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You two… why are you doing a kabe-don even though you're both guys?" "Eh? Kabe-don?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mao said that, Keiki became aware of the position he was in. In front of him was an ikemen, who had one hand on the wall behind Kiryuu and the other on him to support him. From an outsider's perspective, it looked like Shouma pulled a kabe-don on Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Akiyama, will you let go of Kiryuu already?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou… why do you have your smartphone ready like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she told him to let go, she had taken her smartphone out, gotten into position, and taken a photo. And immediately after that, a second one. Then, with a satisfied expression, she returned to her former position and took a third.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really! Really really really! Pulling a kabe-don like that out of the blue, since when were you two like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about?! W-Wait, don't take any more photos! This is too embarrassing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's even better when you're embarrassed, don't you think?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, what the hell are you even saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe her brain was damaged from playing that zombie game. All Keiki knew was that his eyes had started to hurt from all the camera flashes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, might this be jealousy because you're afraid that I'll take Keiki away from you, Mao-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?! A-Are you an idiot?! That's not it at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A perfect tsundere response. Yet, she still didn't stop taking photos. On the contrary, they were being mass-produced right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After about a minute, the photoshoot stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha. I was enjoying myself a bit too much. Ohh, but the pictures turned out great if i do say so myself," The cameraman said as she checked the photos.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-chan is in top form today, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we've definitely been neglecting her recently. I guess she really wanted to have some fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, she always had a deadpan expression on her face, but right now, she looked like a completely different person. Without making eye contact with the boys, every one of them had a small smile on their faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I guess we'll give her what she wanted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, we'll play 'till we drop dead."</p>
<p class="null-p">They had a lot of time. And that red-haired girl would surely use up all of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that was fun! I'm satisfied to the brim!" Mao stretched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we've been walking around the arcade for about three hours," Keiki said as he watched Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My ears hurt from all that noise…" Shouma rubbed his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the three of them left the arcade, they noticed that it had already gotten dark outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's call it a day there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right, we do have school tomorrow after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah," Having seemingly thought of something, Shouma grinned and turned towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki, it's pretty dark, right? How about you see Mao-chan home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah, yeah, I'll do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'll see you two tomorrow. Bye~"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a voice that didn't show how tired he actually was, Shouma separated from the two of them. And he turned around to wink at Keiki once. Basically, Shouma had created a chance for Keiki to investigate if Mao might actually be Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welp, I guess we'll go home as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can go home myself, you know? My home's not far from here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not going to happen, Nanjou. You're a girl after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A girl…" As she muttered that, it looked like she unconsciously touched her hair, "Then, maybe I'll take you up on that offer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger that."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, they started walking. The boy that didn't have any special features about him, and the flashy girl. Two different people becoming friends like this without any common interests is part of what makes life so interesting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Kiryuu, it's gotten pretty late, right? Will Mizuha be fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I told her that she can start eating dinner without me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really doing a great job at being a siscon, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're making me blush."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do I only have a lolicon and a siscon around me, I wonder?" She said with a sigh. "Well, today I had a lot of fun with the two of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. That reminds me, we've been friends for about a year now." "That's… yeah," Suddenly, she stopped walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that I'm really having fun right now but… I might not be able to keep going like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How do I say it… it feels like I'm getting more frustrated every second…</p>
<p class="null-p">Hey, Kiryuu?" She looked straight at Keiki as her cheeks started to get red.</p>
<p class="null-p">And…</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about, uhm… not with the three of us… but how about going forward just with two?"</p>
<p class="null-p">These words were almost like the message of a confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Two… so Nanjou, you mean-"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki wanted to ask, he felt a cold drop on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa, it's starting to rain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The rain grew more intense by the second. Just when they thought that it wasn't so bad, it started pouring en masse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with this…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them evacuated to a nearby overhang.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah, this is the worst…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It came out of nowhere, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the rain got pretty intense very quickly, both their heads and clothes were soaked in a matter of minutes. And Keiki didn't know if he should continue the conversation from before. Though, for some reason, he was happy that he didn't have ask her what she meant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, did they say that it would rain today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope. This was probably a sudden rain front or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sudden rain front, huh. That happens a lot lately… Here, have a towel." "Ah, thanks a bunch. I don't have anything besides a handkerchief-" Keiki swallowed his words because of the sight in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao took out a small towel out of her bag. However, since she wasn't wearing a blazer, he could see right through her blouse because of the rain, making her underwear completely visible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Keiki's movements suddenly stopped like an electrical circuit that was cut, Mao looked at him with a dubious gaze. And, following her friend's gaze, she realized why he had gotten quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, hey! Where are you looking?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry. But, uhm…Nanjou really has quite the bust alright."</p>

<p class="null-p">"What are you saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki blurted out these words without thinking. Having decided that he should probably shut up now, he looked up at the sky. In the meantime, Mao put on her blazer and completely buttoned it up to the top. She then proceeded to glare at him again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now Kiryuu got to see my bra, too… this really is the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's your fault for not wearing your blazer properly, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got hot inside the arcade, which is why I took it off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their conversation came to a sudden halt, and only the sound that was left was the rain pounding down on the world around them. But Keiki didn't exactly hate that silence. It felt like all the stress of the past few days was being washed away from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It looks like the rain isn't going to stop soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kiryuu. Can I ask you something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure, go ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, are you being approached by both your Senpai and Kouhai at the same time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" Because that question was so unexpected, he couldn't come up with a way to cover it up. "…W-Why do you ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, judging from that situation yesterday, it really looked like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said that you didn't want to talk about…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Women can be a bit unfair at times. So, what is it?" Her gaze was clearly saying "Spill it out already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"These two are… It's not like that. I can't properly explain it though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it really looked like they were competing for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, but that's a bit different…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure that Kiryuu wants to go out with a girl too, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, there are times when I think that, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Lewd."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's true, right? You really looked like you enjoyed having one of them at each of your arms."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you that you were wrong about that!" This almost sounds like a lover's quarrel.</p>
<p class="null-p">" --Achoo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was getting worried that the fight might escalate, Mao's sneeze completely snuffed out the flame.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I just thought that your sneeze was really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shut it, idiot," Although she threw that verbal abuse at Keiki, her face got red.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dwelling on that cute reaction, Keiki looked up the dark sky. The rain still hadn't let up. Even if they were safe from the rain, their clothes were still wet and it was starting to get colder. As far as Keiki could see, there weren't any convenience stores close to them, so there was no way for them to get an umbrella. But there was still one good thing. A few meters away, there were a few buildings lined up next to each other. It looked like a karaoke or a small bar, so there should be a vending machine in there somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go buy something to drink. What do you want, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'll take some hot chocolate, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hot chocolate, got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, what about the money-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, it's my treat. I got to see something good earlier, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something good? …Hah?! I-Idiot! Idiot idiot! You're the worst!" She crossed her arms in front of her breasts to hide them, glaring at Keiki with a gaze colder than ever. "Die, you pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing these words, Keiki evacuated into the building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou is rather the pure maiden, I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">If this were Sayuki, she'd be pressing her breasts against Keiki instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki then proceeded to buy two hot chocolate cans. As he returned, he saw Nanjou, still staying sheltered from the pouring rain, looking at her smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…?" What Keiki saw was a grinning, happy looking girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Mao was looking at where the pictures from the arcade. And what was shown in the pictures was mostly the face of Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ahh, I see how it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">Remembering back, the only times when Keiki really felt Mao's gaze was when he was together with Shouma. And Mao was currently looking at the pictures with the face of a maiden in love-</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking everything in consideration, even an idiot would understand what's happening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou… so you were in love with Shouma, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?" Mao's body lightly twitched as Keiki called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing that Keiki's gaze was fixated on the smartphone in her hand, she hurriedly hid it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You're wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, you're misunderstanding! The one I like isn't Shouma but, uhm, y</p>
<p class="null-p">-" Her face went red in an instant, "…Sorry, I'm going home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was still raining, Mao dashed away. And, even after her back disappeared, Keiki couldn't move away from that spot. The moment she had turned to run away, it looked like she had tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What was up with that…?" He muttered, his voice drowned out by the sound of the rain, "If you make that face, I'm gonna start misunderstanding again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He remembered the words written on the front of the love letter. And the short message written within it.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I like you.'</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know who wrote that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know whose feelings those were.</p>
<p class="null-p">Merely a throwaway confession. But now that he had received it and read it, he couldn't ignore it. He certainly couldn't stop until he found out the identity of the girl that held these feelings for him, or his heart could probably never move on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is Nanjou my Cinderella?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And of course, nobody answered the timid prince's question. It was merely washed away by the sound of the rain. </p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, the relationship between Keiki and Mao didn't move forward at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, the day ended with them not being able to talk about that incident. Even though his Kouhai encouraged him, and his Senpai pushed his back, nothing changed. Instead, you could even say that their relationship had only gotten worse. Although Shouma also wanted to know what had happened, Keiki couldn't just tell him the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes had ended, Keiki basically rushed out of the school building only to stop his feet countless times on the way home as he stopped to think.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Nanjou really my Cinderella?" He repeated these words countless times, "Am I not misunderstanding it like the times with Sayuki-senpai and Yuikachan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the reason why Keiki had gotten more timid than ever. Even though Mao might be fishy, he had thought so too in the case of Sayuki and Yuika. He just didn't want to step on another landmine like before. That being said, he couldn't leave this at is. He had to find out, no matter what.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… after she showed me such a face… how should I start talking to her again…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In Keiki's chest, he still felt horrible for forcing her to make such a face. He had reflected on it countless times, and he started hating himself because he let out his own frustration on Mao. Prioritizing his own feelings, he had ignored the girl's feelings, and made her cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really am the worst, aren't I…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Walking on heavy feet, it took him twice as much time as normal to walk home that day. The entrance to his home was unlocked. It looked like Mizuha was already home. And Keiki immediately headed for his own room.</p>
<p class="null-p">I just want to lie down on my bed and sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that comfortable method of running away from reality in his mind, he opened the door. But in that moment, that escape route was cut off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Eh, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In his room that should be empty, for some reason, there was his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing casual clothes, the girl was sitting on top of his bed. Seeing her like that, he was entranced by her beauty. And what Mizuha was doing was looking at a collection of books. Books titled things like 'It's fine if she's legal!' and filled with countless pictures of girls with small bodies and babylike faces. She looked up from the book she was reading and stared at her brother with her usual sleepy expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think that Nii-san was such a lolicon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong! Shouma forgot that book here the last time he came over!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures. Nii-san likes them on the bigger end of the scale after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-Well, that's certainly true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no need to clarify what they were talking about. What was more important was that his little sister had found his secret stash.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what are you doing in here, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I finished cleaning my room, so I thought I'd do Nii-san's room too. Then I happened to spot these very interesting books. After a long fight, I lost against my curiosity."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for sparing me the details. For now, could you not enter your Niisan's room without permission?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care that Nii-san is hiding these books, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It makes sense. I guess I overstepped my bounds, even though we're so close…… Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine. I know that Mizuha is a clean freak and I've been slacking off on cleaning my room for quite some time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha never could overlook any signs of dirt ever since she was born. Even dirt inside Keiki's own room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I give you a lap pillow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Two minutes later, Keiki was resting his head in Mizuha's lap for some reason. Without going into much detail, Keiki was enjoying the situation like a cat as he was gently being petted on the head by Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… why a lap pillow all of a sudden?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the duty of a little sister to be spoiled by her brother, and also to spoil him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, I don't really get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">That response wasn't really a sufficient answer. Even after living with her for countless years, he still didn't quite grasp the personality of his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, did something happen recently?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? W-Why do you ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. I always know when Nii-san is feeling down."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice transmitted a soft warmth. Keiki really loved that voice of hers.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_14.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"As your little sister, I can't ignore Nii-san when he's not feeling well, and I might get some Nii-san points if I give him some advice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that supposed to be, ahahaha," He let out a laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though they had barely started talking, the dark feelings inside his chest had already started to magically clear up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I might as well ask for some advice," He lifted up his body and sat down next to Mizuha, "Actually, I happened to get into a fight with Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With Mao-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that Nanjou is hiding something from me. Without knowing what it is or how she felt about it, I ended up hurting her." Because he was irritated, he hurt her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's no good to force something out of someone if the person doesn't want to talk about it, you know?" Hearing the circumstances, Mizuha showed a complicated smile and said that like she was talking to a kid, "Be it with friends, or even family, there are some things that you can't tell people, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… that might be the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki himself didn't talk about everything with his friends. And of course, that was also the case for his little sister Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But even so, I think I want to know more about Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">There should be things that she can't tell Keiki because she treasures him. But even so, there are feelings that can only be transmitted with words. Even more than wanting to know more about her, he didn't want to hurt her. That's why he would have to take risks in order to get that one step closer to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san doesn't want to be separated from Mao-chan, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you'd better make up with her quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think I should do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you just have to hit her with everything you got."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if I could?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to do anything special. I think that Nii-san just has to be himself and act like he thinks is best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, what if he makes the same mistake again- He remembered Mao's crying face. The pain that he felt as he saw her. Maybe because she realized what Keiki was feeling, Mizuha grabbed his hand, and when he looked up, she was smiling at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you really fail with that, I'll comfort you as long as you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, the girl slowly pulled the timid prince out of his shell. When you're lacking the courage to take the step forward, you have to thin out the fear of it ending up in failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just thinking about his cute little sister comforting him, he wasn't all that afraid of failure anymore. Maybe because Keiki really was a siscon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you Mizuha. I'll give it my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup," She gently smiled at him and told him "Give it your best," with Keiki's favorite voice of hers. </p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The day after he had received advice from Mizuha. As always, school lessons went by without him being able to talk to Mao at all. When he had finished with his work in the library, he received an email from Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Mao-chan is in the classroom right now'</p>
<p class="null-p">As he returned to his own classroom, it was just as the email had said. The brownish red-haired girl was indeed there, resting her head on her arms as she sat at her desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Weird. Normally, she always goes straight home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever the reason, this was his chance, and he couldn't let that slip past him. Taking a deep breath, Keiki entered the classroom. Mao's desk was right in the middle of the classroom, and as he arrived next to it, he raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heeeey, Nanjou-san~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Either she was sleeping, or she was just acting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't wake up, I'm gonna grope your breasts, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Are you an idiot?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His sexual harassment was answered with a cold gaze as she looked up at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you really were awake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmpf."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she still wasn't over what happened the other day. With a displeased expression, she lifted up her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou, you don't look so good, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'm missing a bit of sleep right now is all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Missing sleep you say… What have you been doing at night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's Kiryuu's fault."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason I'm sleep-deprived is your fault. I couldn't stop thinking about you, so I couldn't fall asleep. It's your fault that I'm suffering like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having heard Mao's feelings, Keiki searched for the right words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I want to apologize to Nanjou. To be honest, I don't know how I troubled you so far but I regret hurting you. I don't want to fight with Nanjou, after all, and if you're able to forgive me, I want to know more about you."</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't have confidence that he could properly convey his feelings but he still kept going.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I want to make up to you. If I can make you forgive me, I will do anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Really?" Suddenly standing up, Mao brought her face closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were so close that the air they were breathing started to mix. Thanks to that, Keiki once more realized how beautiful Mao actually was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… will you go out…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her words were like a bullet that shot straight into the adolescent boy's heart. She made fists with her hands and her face went completely red. They were alone in the classroom that was illuminated by the setting sun. On this romantic stage, the heroine once more opened her mouth.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_01_15.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"I told you, right? Moving forward as only two wouldn't be too bad. That's why-" She looked up with expectant eyes as she said these words in a sweet tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no mistake. Nanjou Mao is the girl that wrote the love letter-</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why… will you go out… with Akiyama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she suddenly brought up the name of Akiyama Shouma, his thoughts suddenly stopped. He couldn't actually understand her words just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, Nanjou. Can you repeat that once more?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want Kiryuu to become a couple with Akiyama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me and Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To become lovers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There's gotta be a limit to talking in riddles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she heard him, maybe she didn't, but Mao grabbed her bag and brought a small notebook out. Opening that, she turned it over to show Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, I want it to be like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown on that page were drawings. And it looked like they were from a manga- "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, what was shown on there exceeded Keiki's imaginations.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Shouma. Both of them in their birthday suit. And Shouma's long manhood was about to enter the hole of Keiki's butt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha - What in the living hell is this?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was at this moment that Keiki finally understood the truth of the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">The stage was still the classroom. Both Mao and Keiki were sitting at one desk, facing each other. And on top of said table was a notebook opened up, with pictures that would perfectly fit in a BL manga. BL being an abbreviation for "boys love," which means a story where two boys are in love with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Nanjou-san? What the hell does this mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what it looks like. The truth is, I'm actually a fujoshi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A fujoshi? Doesn't that mean a girl that gets off to seeing two boys in love with each other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep, that kind of fujoshi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Nanjou loves seeing two boys who love each other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I really love it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you also love it when they get erotic together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't get enough of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou Mao belonged to THAT kind of world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're pulling my leg, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not one bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao started laughing at that response. She was currently wearing glasses on her face. Keiki had never seen her wearing glasses before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you were wearing glasses?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh this? Only when I'm in fujoshi mode."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be fair, I'm a bit near-sighted. Normally, it's not that big of a deal, but when I'm drawing, I usually put them on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you say drawing, you mean these BL mangas, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. I also participate in events and so on. My mangas sell really well, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They sell well, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you going to scorn me? Because I'm a girl that draws this stuff?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, everybody has the freedom to choose their own hobby, after all, so I don't mean to say anything about that, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you drawing a BL book with me and Shouma?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, so you're mad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I am?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Anybody would be mad if they were used as a model for a BL manga without their permission.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, this character's name is 'Keeki'! That's almost my real name!" By the way, Shouma's codename was 'Shouto'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did think that using your real names would be bad. Also, I came up with those names because combined, they become 'Shortcake,' and that's why I stayed with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So my privacy lost against a whim of yours…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Nanjou-sensei's newest work was called 'Shouto and Keiki's creamy showdown.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"There were times when Nanjou was practically staring at Shouma and I, right? Does that have anything to do with the two of us becoming characters for your BL manga?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. I didn't want to miss a single moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the reason why you were missing sleep before…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because the deadline for my next manga was close."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So when you ask me from time to time to take over cleaning duty for you, it's also because of that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When my deadline is dangerously close, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… when you drew the library committee in the lottery one year ago…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't have the time to draw any more BL manga, so I couldn't join."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's all about BL manga?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her whole world revolved around BL manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the other day when you were looking at the photos of Shouma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was checking my reference material. He might be a pervert, but his face is pretty good looking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is the truth always so heartbreaking…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wish you'd stop with your weird misunderstandings, Kiryuu. Me liking</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma… who would like a lolicon like him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So that's what she meant when she said "It's not Akiyama that I like…". She meant that she liked the BL between Shouma and Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But still, why didn't you tell me that time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was trying to hide the fact that I'm a fujoshi. I actually planned on hiding it forever, but since Kiryuu started having affairs, I had to do something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really get it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, you've been on good terms with Tokihara-senpai and Yuika, right? That really troubled me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't get enough material."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you spend more time with other girls, you'll leave Akiyama all alone, you know? That means that my reference material will disappear. I invited only the three of us to the arcade, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's why you told me not to get close to other girls, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And since you have Shouto, I won't forgive Keeki for being all lovey-dovey with other women!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not confuse me with the character in your manga please?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to Kiryuu having fun with other women, I ended up in a slump. I was already pretty close to missing the deadline, but now I'm in really trouble thanks to you, you know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you being a bit unfair here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, but the kabe-don photos were a real lifesaver. I managed to draw an awesome scene thanks to that inspiration."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy for you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, the scene I'm talking about is this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, stop! Don't come any closer with that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What she was showing him was even more horrifying to Keiki than before. To be precise, Keeki was being kabe-don'd by the ikemen Shouto, who softly whispered "You can't get away anymore." (Both of them were naked). With flushed cheeks, Keeki averted his gaze with a "S-Shouto…" (Still naked). And in the end Keeki gave in to the temptation and accepted Shouto as they hugged each other-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please try to resist a bit more, will you…" Keiki said to his manga self.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This composition is godlike if I do say so myself… Fufu…… Fufufufufufufufufufu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Scary!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was shocked that his female friend was like this in private.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou, can you at least stop using me and Shouma as material?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because there are a lot of girls who want to read the continuation of this." "C-Continuation? What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the 'Shouto and Keeki Series' is actually really popular."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're turning it into a series?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After finding out that Mao was a fujoshi, the shocks came one after another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, the indecisive and innocent Keeki plus the experienced ikemen</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouto make a great combo. And it looks like a lot of fans agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop! I don't want to hear another word!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But well, the circumstances are like that. I'm sorry for turning you into my model without asking, but I can't exactly restructure it at this point, and it would trouble me if you and Akiyama stop flirting now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like I'm really flirting with Shouma, though……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll properly convert everything into fitting material so don't worry. Even when boys are eating lunch together, I can perfectly imagine a R-18 scene to draw about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wouldn't it be better to go to the hospital then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, I beg you! As a fan of my novel, please go out with Akiyama!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't wanna!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter if you're both boys as long as there's love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It clearly does?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would it be fine by you if I couldn't move forward with my manuscript?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I'd be fine if you never finished it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu… you don't have to be so rude… But… I have my own ways of making you help me out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…And what would that be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After this, every time Kiryuu gets close to another girl, I'll do everything possible to get between the two of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you were to get a girlfriend, my manuscript would suffer, right? A BL manga where the protagonist gets taken by a girl wouldn't sell at all, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why should I care about that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but if you were to cheat with another boy, that would be different, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's clearly not safe! That's completely not ok for me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope you're ready. I'll be sure to do my job properly! With full strength!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That pronouncement sounded really serious, so she probably had already made up her mind before this discussion.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, just like that, another obstacle got added to the story of the prince's search for Cinderella. </p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the classroom that Keiki had left just now, Mao still remained on her seat. Not knowing what she should do, she continued to sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Kiryuu is such a thick-headed idiot…" For now, she decided to badmouth the poor boy, "Well, I can never muster up enough courage myself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever Keiki got close with another girl, she would dislike it. Her not being able to produce a good manuscript was one thing, but that wasn't the only reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, how long do I have to suffer through this unrequited love just because he saved me a little bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching the Keeki inside her manga being tightly hugged by Shouto didn't evoke any jealousy at all in her. But when the real Keiki acts close to other girls, it makes her angry. First anger, then she gets mad… and finally, depressed. To be precise, she gets jealous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually, the reason why she couldn't make any progress with her manuscript wasn't because she didn't have enough material. Truth be told, she could only think about Keiki being together with another girl, making it impossible for her to progress with the manuscript.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, forget it. I'll just hurry home and continue with my manuscript." Anything for her precious readers that are waiting for the next book. And with these words, the young BL writer left the classroom behind her to finish her manuscript before the next deadline. </p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">After separating from Mao, Keiki walked down the hallway with mixed feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that Nanjou would be drawing BL mangas with Shouma and I as the characters…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To be fair, no one could have predicted that his classmate would be producing R-18 manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it looks like Nanjou isn't my Cinderella."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou Mao didn't have any feelings for Kiryuu Keiki. What she loved wasn't Keiki himself, but rather a personified image of him, so she couldn't have been the sender of the love letter. While he was thinking this, Keiki stopped in front of the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nanjou isn't Cinderella, then is it Sayuki-senpai or Yuika-chan, after all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, he was back at square one. It looked like it would still take some time until he could find the Cinderella that dropped her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………I guess I'll go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he opened his locker with a big sigh, his hands stopped. Going "Ugh" unconsciously, his face twisted in disgust. On top of his shoes, there was a weird-looking envelope.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again with this… who could it be this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had told him that she wouldn't approach him for a while, so this one must be Yuika's work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As long as it's not another bra. I don't think I can survive another terrorist attack like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to keep himself optimistic, he tore the seal open and pulled out the paper inside. The moment he did, however, he immediately regretted his prior optimism.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for that was the single photo he took out of the envelope. Said photo showed the calligraphy clubroom, with a boy and a girl pair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki, with her hands in handcuffs, wearing a rather revealing maid uniform. And Kiryuu Keiki, who was in the process of plunging his hand deeply into the valley between her breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUT?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The actual truth of the picture was that Kiryuu Keiki had to get the key to the girl's handcuffs because it accidentally fell into her chest. But to a casual observer, it definitely looked like a high school student had forced a girl into a maid costume and restrained her with handcuffs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who the hell took this picture…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, he thought of Sayuki but - that couldn't be the case. Judging from the angle, it was taken from outside the windows, and it was taken at the perfect moment, so it couldn't have been an amateur. In addition to that photo, there was a message inside the envelope. It wasn't a person's handwriting, rather it was a printed letter. It read:</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki,</p>
<p class="null-p">If you are reading this, come this to location immediately:</p>
<p class="null-p">Astronomy club room on the third floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you decline, your dignity may suffer greatly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, they're threatening to publicize that photo, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the choice of words seemed a bit off, there was something else that greatly interested Keiki. Even though it was addressed to his name, there was no name of a sender anywhere on the paper. Although the seal was different, and the text wasn't handwritten, it still resembled Cinderella's love letter a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did Cinderella leave this letter in my locker?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If that were the case, he might get a chance to meet the girl who he had been looking for. He might finally find out the identity of the girl who had dropped her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The astronomy club, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he had barely finished his conversation with Mao, there was no way that he couldn't go there now. Of course, he also couldn't ignore the threat of him, and also Sayuki, getting expelled for doing something like this on school grounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">With these thoughts, Keiki closed the locker and headed towards the location mentioned in the message.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is the astronomy club room, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The room was in the deepest part of the third floor. As he knocked, he received a short "Come in." What greeted Keiki after he opened the door was pitch-black darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why is it so dark in here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he could barely see, he could make out a few machinery parts in the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He took a deep breath and stepped forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, I saw the letter in my shoe locker and came here as requested," He tried calling out in hopes of receiving an answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, instead, he heard the sound of the door closing behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh?" Turning around at that sound, he spotted a human shadow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaa?!" Bumping into that person, Keiki fell onto the floor. "…… Ouch."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he muttered that, he felt like he was being pushed down onto the floor by that shadow. The person pushing him down was wearing a sweater with a hood. Because of that and the darkness inside the room, he couldn't make out person's face. However, seeing an outline of a skirt and feeling a soft butt, Keiki thought that his person was a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Please don't move," A voice echoed in the dark room.</p>
<p class="null-p">A smartphone screen was shoved into his face. Shown on it was the same photo that had been inside the envelope.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you make even the slightest movement, please consider your social life to be over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow, it feels like this stuff keeps happening to me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told to become the owner of a collar wearing girl, or getting freshlyworn panties stuffed into his mouth, he wasn't even surprised by this sort of experience anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you listen to my request, I will get rid of the photo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's-" Underneath the hood, the girl's cheeks slightly blushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because his eyes had started to grow accustomed to the darkness, he could see the girl's face more clearly now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she looked a bit young, she was still quite the beauty. She was fidgeting slightly, and that was also pretty cute. Because she looked like she was about to confess, Keiki gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">S-So is this girl really Cinderella…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hand softly gripped Keiki's uniform. And, with quivering lips, she said:</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I think… that this is love…"</p>
<p class="null-p">From her words, this clearly looked like it was going to be a confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first, I was just happy with watching from afar… But, after a bit, I couldn't stop my feelings from overflowing and I didn't know what to do, so I happened to threaten you with that photo…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Woaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like he had finally met Cinderella. After being terrorized by masochistic Senpai, a sadistic witch-like Kouhai, and a fujoshi classmate, this girl looked like an absolute goddess to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">W-Woah, this girl is actually really friggin cute!</p>
<p class="null-p">Still being pushed down by her, he tightly gripped her hand in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's get married!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do I have to marry Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Keiki realized that they weren't talking about the same thing, a soft breeze blew in from the open window and lifted up the curtains. And that ray of sunlight lit up the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sight in front of him was so abnormal that his thinking process stopped. The interior of the room was decorated with countless photos. Not only on the walls but also on the ceiling, photos covering every square inch of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What the hell is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And on every last one of these photos was one single male student.</p>
<p class="null-p">A photo where he was drinking a freshly bought cola from a vending machine.</p>
<p class="null-p">A photo where he was talking to his classmates inside the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">A photo where he was swinging his racket on the tennis court.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown in these pictures was a person that Keiki was very familiar with. A dear friend of his, who he knew was a complete lolicon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I am happy about your feelings, but my target is Akiyama-kun after all, so I can't marry Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who Keiki had thought was his destined goddess was actually nothing more than a stalker with Akiyama Shouma as her target.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like the girl that wanted him to become her owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like the girl that wanted him to become her slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like the girl that was actually just a fujoshi.</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, around Keiki, perverts seemed to gather to no end. Even though he just wanted to experience a normal love. Finding out the identity of the love-letter sender, getting her as a girlfriend, and being lovey-dovey with her was all he had wanted. Even so, it had once again ended up completely different.</p>
<p class="null-p">Would he be eaten up by all these perverts?</p>
<p class="null-p">Or would he be able to get a normal girlfriend before that happened?</p>
<p class="null-p">He was a prince with a name as sweet as candy, but Cake-kun's story wasn't sweet at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl that had left behind the love letter and dropped her panties: Cinderella. And that girl, even now, hadn't shown her tail in front of the prince.</p>
<p class="null-h2">To be continue...</p>
<p class="null-h1">AFTERWORD</p>
<p class="null-p">It's been a long time. And for those of you who don't know me, it's nice to meet you. I'm Hanama Tomo.</p>
<p class="null-p">This work is a love-comedy, yes, but I put some perverted ingredients into it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every introduced character has a perverted side one hundred percent of the time. Just as the title states, they might look cute at first glance, but they're all perverted heroines. But, since they're cute, it doesn't matter that they're perverted, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">How did you like this perverted love-comedy? I would be very happy if you found it fun to read.</p>
<p class="null-p">And lastly, my thanks.</p>
<p class="null-p">A big thanks to my illustrator sune-sensei for drawing such wonderful illustrations. The cover with Yuika is extremely cute. And her thighs are the best.</p>
<p class="null-p">To everyone from the publishing department, and to all of you who took this book into your hands, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning your support into motivation, I will give it my best so that we can hopefully see each other in the next volume.</p>
