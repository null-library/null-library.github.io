<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after the discovery of the scandalous picture hung up on the billboard at the student entrance, an emergency meeting for the Ayano faction was held inside the student council room. Around the large table sat Keiki and the four current members of the student council, making it five. Together with him sat Shiho, who had decided to join because of the emergency, even though she had her entrance exams to worry about, Airi, the male crossdressed version of Rin, and Ayano. All of them had fallen into silence, their expressions showing the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first one to break the silence was Rintarou from his seat next to Keiki. "This has become quite problematic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… Someone actually took a picture of that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying this, Keiki directed his gaze to the two pictures that were placed on the table. A few minutes prior, they had been hanging on the billboard. One of them showed Keiki being hugged by Ayano, whereas the other depicted a moment when Keiki's head had been buried in Shiho's well-endowed chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We took the pictures down right away, but I doubt we've managed to avoid keeping them from influencing the election." Airi spoke up from her seat across from Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't stop people from talking, after all," Shiho muttered from her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Above the two pictures in question was a caption that only made matters worse: 'Kiryuu Keiki from class 2B is two-timing!' A love affair in the middle of the student council. During an election period, topics like this would spread like wildfire. It was only a matter of time until rumours started</p>
<p class="null-p">filling the school's corridors.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never thought that they'd bring up Keikun-senpai's two-timing now of all times."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's absolute nonsense, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, were you just toying with me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, things are looking rather grim right now, so can we put the jokes on hold for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he quickly rebutted Ayano's awful-timed joke, Keiki earned himself a high-quality pout from her. Honestly speaking, she looked really cute, but he didn't have the time to admire it.</p>
<p class="null-p">A scandal had been brought up the day before the final election. It was very likely to harm Ayano's reputation, since she was aiming to become the next student council president. Doubts about two-timing were never good no matter how you spun them, and if rumours started to spread, Ayano's party would quickly be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was trying to organize this mess in his head, Airi spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I doubt that bringing up any two-timing accusations about Kiryuu- senpai would change anything, given his known image. Also, Kiryuu-senpai, you did something like that with Shiho-senpai? You're the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good job, Keikun-senpai! I also want to bury my face in a girl's breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just to let you know, I didn't dive into her chest out of my own free will, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His two Kouhais were trying to categorize him as a native of the planet of breasts, so he quickly denied their accusations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about this, Keiki-kun. All because I acted without thinking…" "No, it's not your fault, Takasaki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Who would have expected that someone had been around to take a picture of that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, who could have taken these pictures?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that obvious! It has to be those people from the manga research club!" Airi answered Shiho's question with a harsh tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since the election had started that Monday, Ayano had held a constant lead over her opposing candidate Megumi. Since the final election was tomorrow, it was easy to assume that the Onizuka faction had her hands in this. They were simply trying to decrease the number of people who would vote for Ayano as much as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Ai-chan, we don't have any proof that the people from the manga research club did it, do we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That… is true, but… Wait, don't use this situation to call me 'Ai-chan'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Confused by Rintarou's words of warning, Airi almost took the bait. Still, after they'd done all they could, she probably couldn't bear to see their hard work crumble thanks to such dirty methods. And that wasn't just true of Airi. Everyone present felt the same way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that the folks from the manga research club are prime suspects, but just as Rintarou says, we don't have any definite proof."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if the manga research club was an obvious party to blame, they couldn't ignore another possibility. That it was just a bad joke, a crime committed in jest, completely unrelated to the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, we don't have much time right now, so let's meet up again during lunch break."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shiho brought that up, all the eyes in the room turned towards the clock. It was about time for homeroom to start. They made the decision to break for now, and everyone prepared to leave the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I know," Airi spoke up, sounding like she remembered something. "Ayano-senpai. From now on, you're not allowed to recharge with Kiryuu- senpai anymore, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…" Barely having stood up from her chair, Ayano froze in place. "I can't… recharge anymore?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… could you not look at me like the world is about to end?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she was a bit hesitant after seeing Ayano's heartbroken reaction, Airi still held her ground. That's the heartless Airi for you. She didn't stop lecturing the current vice president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's an obvious countermeasure. As of right now, someone is secretly taking pictures of you, Ayano-senpai. We don't know who it is, so we don't know where they might be watching."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you put up with it now, Kiryuu-senpai will let you recharge as much as you want after."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Nagase-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki raised his voice in protest, Airi didn't back down at all. She ignored him completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I'll be able to sniff Kiryuu-kun as much as I want?" "Of course. You can even take him home if you want to." "I'm not okay with this at all, though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If possible, he didn't want to be forced into any promises he didn't even make. He didn't even want to imagine the embarrassment he would have to go through if Ayano, the smell fetishist, really took him home for a day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. If I can do that later, I'll hold back for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your reason for working hard is kind of insane…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, the promise seemed to have worked, and Ayano agreed. Now if only Keiki hadn't had his basic human rights taken from him in the process…</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, this is better than having her be in a bad mood during such an important time.</p>
<p class="null-p">This had happened because of someone's ill will. Although she might not be showing it on the outside, there's no way that Ayano hadn't been really shocked by this. The election was about to come to an end. Only the final speech was left the following day in the afternoon. Keiki didn't want her to break down right before the home stretch.</p>
<p class="null-p">After separating from the girls at the student council room, Keiki headed alone to the classroom for class 2B.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But why did the perpetrator do something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he made his way to the classroom, he was still pondering the two scandalous pictures. Though he didn't know the identity of the evildoer, they without a doubt had some sort of hostility towards him and Ayano. Was that hostility because of the election? Were they trying to destroy Ayano's lead? Or was it a personal grudge against Keiki or Ayano? Either one was just as important. Because of that, they couldn't ignore it. They would need to figure out what to do about this. While he was thinking about this, someone called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh, Kiryuu-shi?" "…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have just arrived at school. A girl wearing a beige skirt, with her student bag in hand, called out to Keiki. Her short hair was slightly fluttering, which gave her a cute first impression. He didn't remember ever seeing her before, though, so he found himself just staring at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… Who are you again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're fine with just randomly forgetting the face of your classmate like that? It's Onizuka. Onizuka Megumi, your opponent during this student council president election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! Onizuka-san?!" Keiki couldn't hold back his voice from his surprise. "Could you… maybe not scream like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… I mean…" Keiki stuttered as he once again ran his eyes over Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened to your hair?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, about this…" Megumi fidgeted with the tips of her hair, which barely reached her shoulders. "…Well, after my love went up in flames yesterday, I kind of cut it off in the heat of the moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…How did that happen?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">That was the biggest reason Keiki hadn't realized he was talking to Onizuka Megumi. Because of the incident that had happened the day prior, Megumi had undergone quite a drastic change in personal image. Her trademark long, fluffy hair had been cut short without leaving any traces behind. She now was sporting more of a boyish look.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: Is it wrong to want the heroine's skirt?</p>
<p class="null-p">The previous day after classes came to an end, Megumi took a quick detour to the hairdressing salon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Are you really sure about this?" "Yeah. Just get it over with quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing how determined Megumi was about it, the young hairdresser lady brought her scissors up to the fluffy hair and started working. Bundles of hair fell to the ground with each snip of the scissors.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" Megumi watched the mirror in silence as her trademark hair vanished.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she would usually visit the hairdressing salon from time to time to trim the tips of her hair, she had forgotten how long it had been since she had gotten such a drastic haircut.</p>
<p class="null-p">In her younger days, as a countermeasure to the nickname 'Oniko' other kids had called her, she had let her hair grow out, like a princess. This, of course, was because the princesses who appear in fairy tales and stories all have beautiful long hair. To Megumi, having long hair like that was proof of being a princess. It was a lot of trouble to grow her hair out so long, but after her close childhood friend Naoya told her it looked good on her, she felt so happy that she let it grow out even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back to it, that had probably been her main motivation. To have her hair grow out longer and to be admired more, like a princess. But there was</p>
<p class="null-p">no reason to do so anymore. Before she came to the hairdressing salon, her love had crumbled away to nothing in the school's library. She had overheard the conversation between Naoya and Keiki, and now she knew Naoya's love wasn't directed at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">What else can I do? He said that we aren't a good match.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to become a princess for him, but that wish couldn't be granted anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"-And because of that, I cut my hair." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since they didn't have time to talk about it early in the morning, they postponed the conversation until the short recess after the first period. Keiki's face grew pale when Megumi told him her reasons in a nearby empty classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, you cut your hair in order to cut off your feelings for Inui- senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's about it, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you do something like that?!" "Why are you getting angry at me, Kiryuu-shi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because this was all a one-sided misunderstanding on Megumi's part. In reality, Onizuka Megumi and Inui Naoya both had feelings for each other, and if they could just confess their feelings, they could enjoy their days as a happy couple. There was absolutely no reason to cut her hair like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's my fault. Because I did something unnecessary, Onizuka-san cut her hair!</p>
<p class="null-p">If Keiki had simply kept his nose out of their love affairs, this entire mess wouldn't have happened. Because of his decision, all of this… Because of</p>
<p class="null-p">him, their relationship could no longer be healed… Because of him, Megumi had cut her hair, which is something of a girl's life essence. She threw away her long, fluffy hair, trading it for this shorter haircut.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was being plagued with an immense feeling of guilt, Megumi spoke to him again, slightly anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Does it look that bad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, I think that your current hairstyle is just as cute as before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for that," Megumi sounded a bit bashful after hearing Keiki's sincere thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of her cut hair, her smile looked more grown up than it had before. Keiki was impressed by how much a simple haircut could completely change the impression she gave off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I let my hair grow out because I wanted to become a princess. I wanted to become beautiful so that I could be worthy of Nao-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think a part of me was actually lost. I was wondering if it was really fine for me to become the student council president and completely ban any romantic relationships. If I had to guess, I probably had some regrets. While I was boasting about my plans, there was a part of me that couldn't give up on a possible future of being able to go out with Nao-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Megumi said this, Keiki remembered something that Ayano had told him a while ago. On the first day of the election-planning during lunchtime, Ayano had received a declaration of war in the club room building. Back then, Ayano had told Keiki that Megumi looked like she looked lost and hesitant.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Megumi had just told Keiki the reason for this. The main reason why she had decided to join the election as a student council president candidate was purely for Naoya's sake. After being rejected by Rinko, Naoya couldn't bear the pain he had felt, and had started holding deep grudges towards the flirty couples walking around at school. Because the radiating glow of normies enjoying their lives was too much for him. Megumi wanted to ban all romantic relationships in order to ease his pain, while still holding onto the faint hope of being able to become a couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, being flat-out rejected like this was really relieving. Because I like Nao- kun, I want to create an ideal school life for his sake."</p>
<p class="null-p">For Naoya's sake, she would become the student council president. Even in such a devastating situation, her original goal had not changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really like Inui-senpai, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's words showed just as much she felt for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should I do about this? I want to clear up the misunderstanding, but I can't just tell her about Inui-senpai's feelings…</p>
<p class="null-p">If he really wanted to clear up the misunderstanding, Keiki would be forced to reveal Naoya's love for Megumi…</p>
<p class="null-p">But Inui-senpai said that he would be giving up on Onizuka-san…</p>
<p class="null-p">After the incident involving Rinko, Naoya had lost his confidence as a man. He might be able to force Naoya to confess, but after the horrible mistake the day prior, Keiki was scared of unnecessarily meddling even further for fear that he would only make things even worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, are you okay, Kiryuu-shi?" "Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard the girls in our class calling you a two-timing bastard. That you sunk your poisonous fangs into both Fujimoto-chan and Takasaki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the rumors were already going around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apparently it was one picture of you sexually harassing Fujimoto-chan, and another one of you burying your face into president Takasaki's chest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm amazed how wrong the rumors are!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never thought you were that much of a player, Kiryuu-shi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The pictures are one thing, but the two-timing rumors are absolutely false, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The question was, who even took these scandalous pictures? Airi said that the manga research club was suspect, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Let me just ask you this. This isn't your doing, right?" "You doubt me that much, Kiryuu-shi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to, but considering the situation…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi was the only one who would really profit from this during the election. Naturally, Keiki had to at least give the possibility some consideration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, considering the timing, I can't really blame you. I would profit from this entire scandal after all." Stating the facts, Megumi directed an intense gaze at Keiki. "But I will win fair and square in this election. Using such cheap tactics is not what I want to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no way of verifying if those words were true or not. But he had been under the impression that she wasn't the perpetrator from the very beginning. Someone asking for her club's help, who was working her hardest for the person she liked wouldn't use such underhanded measures that hurt other people in the process.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if it isn't Onizuka-san, who else would stand to gain anything from</p>
<p class="null-p">this…?</p>
<p class="null-p">The only other suspects could be the male members of the manga research club, but again, there was no proof. Looking for the criminal was important, of course, but first they had to come up with a way to get rid of these rumors. On top of that, they had to prepare for the candidates' final speech. If only nothing else happened before the end of the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki's feeble wish would not be granted.</p>
<p class="null-p">After his conversation with Megumi, Keiki returned to the classroom and forced himself to endure through the lessons. Keiki decided to talk to Shouma about the scandal and rumor during the next recess. He was also wary at first about Mao's reaction, but she just slept through most of the classes. Most likely, she had thought of too much material for Keiki X Naoya, which had kept her busy the entire night creating new manuscripts for her doujinshi.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the third period came to an end, messages from both Yuika and Sayuki reached Keiki, as they most likely had heard the rumors as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">From Yuika came the message 'You'd better tell Yuika the details later, okay? Depending on what it is, there might be punishment~' It sounded awful scary.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Sayuki contacted Keiki with 'I won't hear any excuses. As punishment, you will have to treat me as a pig for an entire day!'</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't want either one to happen, so he quickly messages in return, explaining the circumstances. Naturally, his explanations to Sayuki and Yuika didn't save him from getting awfully cold gazes from his female classmates, but he had to ignore them for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keikun-senpai!" "Oh, Rintarou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the way to the student council office, Keiki was joined by Rintarou, who was carrying bread in his arms. While he walked next to Keiki, Rintarou</p>
<p class="null-p">directed his gaze at the lunch box in Keiki's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keikun-senpai, are you going to eat lunch in the student council office?" "Yeah, the gazes of the girls in the classroom hurt a bit too much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like the two-timing rumor has been going strong, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Starting with Shouma, Keiki went on to clear up the misunderstanding, but unlike his rumored position as the harem king of the calligraphy club, the naysayers now had proof in the form of the pictures. Just denying it wouldn't be enough to erase the rumors completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did have a talk with Nagase-san, and we decided to explain the situation to the newspaper club so that they clear up any rumors going on in their article. You can trust the newspaper club, after all. If they put out the article this afternoon, it should help clear up the rumors by the final election tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. The newspaper club, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if the student council itself denied these assumptions, since they're directly involved, it wouldn't exactly sound credible. However, if an outsider like the newspaper club said the rumors were false, the information would sound more credible, as they're more trustworthy in this scenario. It wasn't a bad approach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I leave the negotiations with the newspaper club to you, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. You just focus on the final speech, Keikun-senpai, and support Ayanon-senpai as much as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Rintarou was the kind of guy who'd wear female clothes as a hobby, he was also the type to take his work seriously. Keiki felt safe leaving the negotiations with the newspaper club to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">While they talked, the two boys arrived at the student council office. Since he had been coming here on almost a daily basis, Keiki opened the door without even knocking first.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work every-"</p>
<p class="null-p">The female members of the student council were already in the room. That much was perfectly fine. It made sense for them to be present. No problems there. The only thing that was out of the ordinary was that out of the three girls, one was barely wearing anything. Her underwear was all that was covering her body, and that just barely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto…san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The renowned vice president of the student council was wide-eyed, wearing only a white bra and panties in broad daylight. She seemed to have been in the middle of changing her clothes. Her well-formed chest, her beautiful white belly, her charming hips, everything that made her an appealing young lady was revealed for all to see.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">All five people present in the room abruptly stopped moving. Ayano was seated in a chair in her underwear, Airi was holding a towel for some reason, Keiki was standing in the doorframe, and Rintarou was frozen behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of them had lost their ability to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first one to react was Airi. She stormed towards the door in rage and panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai?! Why are you peeking like this?!" "I'm innocent, though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just get out already!" "Right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was urged out of the room, Keiki quickly turned around and shut the door behind him. Resting his back against the door, he let out a long sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ahhh, that took me by surprise."</p>
<p class="null-p">An unexpected feeling assaulted Keiki. Ayano's body had fully entranced Keiki's gaze. Then again, who would expect to see such a scene when walking into the student council room like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good for you. You were able to see Ayanon-senpai like that." "You saw it too, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sadly, since I was right behind you, I wasn't able to see much." "Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Keiki had stumbled right into a lucky pervert moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why was Fujimoto-san changing in the student council office of all places?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If their previous class had been PE, she could have just changed in the designated changing rooms…</p>
<p class="null-p">After they waited for a few moments, the door to the room opened again, and Airi peeked out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can come in now." "Alright…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki entered the room, he was greeted by the sight of Ayano wearing a jersey. Her cheeks were tinted a faint pink, and she narrowed her eyes at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu-kun, you pervert." "I have no excuses."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he had done so with no ill intent, he had still seen her in her underwear. Thus, he had to apologize properly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, that really shocked me. To think that I forgot to lock the door while Ayano-senpai was changing…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not your fault, Airi," Ayano cheered up Airi, who was busy blaming herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho for her part was watching this scenario unfold, a big grin on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Keiki-kun, aren't you quite the lucky man to be able to see Ayano-chan like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's not true!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your eyes were glued to her… This is why men are the worst." The gaze from Keiki's Kouhai grew even more icy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Fujimoto-san, why were you changing in the student council office?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano had trouble answering after Keiki asked her that. Airi gave the answer in her place, quite bluntly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someone poured water on Ayano-senpai." "Huh? Water?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki directed his gaze to Ayano, who nodded in affirmation. "On the way here, it came from above the stairs…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was with her, but I couldn't see the perpetrator…" Airi grit her teeth. "Why would someone do this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi had been saved from the attack, but Ayano's uniform had ended up completely drenched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And after coming here we found this note hanging on the door." "What note?" Keiki accepted the piece of paper from Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">In rough handwriting, the note read as follows:</p>
<p class="null-p">'Withdraw from the election. If not, next time we'll pour condensed milk on vice president Ayano and post pictures of it everywhere.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Condensed… milk?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki audibly gulped at this despicable threat. What would happen if one poured condensed milk on a girl's face? The answer to that was as clear and bright as a fire shining in the dark. A white, sticky liquid would be all over her face. She would have an almost disgusted expression, close to breaking out in tears. It would look like a scene straight out of some porn magazine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That bastard… Who would dare to do something so horrible…?!" "They can't possibly be human…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Rintarou both nodded to each other, understanding the graveness of the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, so underhanded. This is why men are…" Obviously envisioning the same thing as the two boys, Airi made a fierce glare.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano was the only one who didn't understand the problem. She just looked around the room with a blank expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, what's the significance of condensed milk?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well, that's…" Keiki felt too embarrassed to explain. Shiho rose to the occasion to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let this Onee-san teach you~" She stood up from her seat and approached Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaning up next to the vice president's ear, she started whispering. "-Basically, you use-from the boy-put it on-the girl's face-" "!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard Shiho's explanation, Ayano's face started burning bright red. Now that she understood everything, she mumbled feebly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Milk would be troublesome…" "Yup, pretty much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki couldn't help but think that her reaction was cute considering that she was a pervert herself, but sadly it wasn't the time to tease her about this. Instead, Airi got back to the main topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's important is the 'Withdraw from the election' part. Now it's obvious what goal the perpetrator has in all of this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's related to the election… meaning there's a high chance that the pictures this morning come from the same person."</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering the timing of this, there could only be one explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, this person would find it troublesome if Ayano-chan became the student council president."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means the people from the manga research club are the biggest suspects, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou agreed with Shiho's assumption. Since this was related to the election, they couldn't disregard the possibility that the manga research club was involved.</p>
<p class="null-p">The third-year Inooka, who hid his eyes behind his long bangs.</p>
<p class="null-p">The second-year Shikagawa, who had a slender stature and wore glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">The tiny first-year Chouno, who looked relatively calm in comparison.</p>
<p class="null-p">Could one of them be the perpetrator? Could they be trying to help the Otasa Princess in her campaign?</p>
<p class="null-p">"As the election campaign strategy director-general, I can't ignore this perpetrator any longer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I agree with Nagase-san," Rintarou said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Splashing water onto a girl like that? That's going way too far."</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, if things went on like this, it wouldn't just influence the election. Now that the perpetrator had acted two times, the chances of them carrying out their threat written on the note couldn't be disregarded. Keiki for his part didn't want Ayano to suffer any more than this. And for that-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's catch the perpetrator. We can't have them pour milk on Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">They had to secure the mastermind behind this. There was no other way they could avoid any more incidents such as this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But how are you going to catch them, Kiryuu-senpai?" "That's the problem…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As of right now, they had no definite hints or proof that could lead them to the mastermind. They didn't really have the time to thoroughly look into the matter, either, since their time limit was the following day when classes came to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The safest way would be to catch them red-handed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… they're probably going to be careful about this, so I doubt it'll go our way that easily…" Shiho showed a troubled expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why don't we make me the bait?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rejected. We can't put Fujimoto-san into danger."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreed. What would you do if something happened, Ayano-senpai?" "But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's idea was shot down immediately. No matter how desperate they were to catch the perpetrator, the risk was too great. The perpetrator was someone who was prepared to hurt a poor girl like Ayano by pouring water on her. There was no proof that their enemy was only one person, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… A decoy operation…" "Rintarou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We might be able to do something about this." "Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thanks to the method I just came up with, we can keep Ayanon-senpai away from any danger… But I'll need your assistance, Keikun-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup~" Rintarou nodded with a devilish grin. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw this grin, Keiki had a horrible premonition.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day, once classes came to an end, the 'Perpetrator' saw Fujimoto Ayano busily going about election duties. Vice president Fujimoto was hanging up election posters on the billboards in the hallway of the special classroom building. The perpetrator hid in the shadows nearby, watching over her. He had warned her thoroughly, and yet she showed no signs of withdrawing from the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-I guess I'll have to scare her some more."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had assumed that this would happen, so he was already wearing a clown mask on his face. He took out a small water pistol from his pocket. Inside this pistol, however, was not water, but rather thick condensed milk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kekeke. I'm looking forward to seeing her sullied face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He would spray the milk on the poor girl and finish it off with a perfectly- timed picture. After that, he would share this picture around the entire school campus.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano seemed to be taking a break. She entered a nearby empty classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Heh, now that's lucky…</p>
<p class="null-p">What a foolish girl for entering a place with no means of escape. Though he hadn't seen anybody else around, this lowered his odds of being spotted by anyone else even more. What good fortune for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He slowly snuck towards the classroom Ayano had entered. When he carefully peeked inside, he confirmed that his target was standing right next to the window, so he rushed in to attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Prepare yourself, vice president Fujimoto!" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard his sudden voice, Ayano turned around in shock. He pointed the muzzle of the water gun right at her, steadied his aim, and-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eat thiiiiiiiiiis!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He pulled the trigger without hesitation. A white line sprayed out of the muzzle, hitting the girl right in the face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahaha! That's what you get!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Any girl would be humiliated by having her face splattered with this white liquid. All he had to do was take out his smartphone, take a photo, and escape from this place. He shifted the water gun to his left hand while taking out the smartphone with his right.</p>
<p class="null-p">"With this, you're done for, vice president Fujimoto!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when he pointed the camera at the girl, an odd sense of discomfort assaulted him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Was the vice president always this tall?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto Ayano was quite the celebrity at their school. Thanks to her official work as the vice president, she had stood on the school stage quite a few times, and every time it was clear that she wasn't the tallest girl out there.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the Ayano in front of him had to have been taller than 170 centimeters, at least.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. A water gun filled with milk. Not a bad idea, punk." "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice that reached his ears didn't belong to Ayano. No, it wasn't even a girl's voice at all. Instead, it sounded a bit rough, almost like a man's-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu. I've caught you, dear perpetrator~" "Huh?! Y-You…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was taken so much by surprise that he couldn't stop the vice president (?) from grabbing hold of his arm. On top of that, he was given a fierce bear hug, the kind you would normally see from Westerners.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wahhhhhhhhhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was embraced by arms that didn't even belong to a girl, the perpetrator let out an agonized scream. While he desperately tried to escape</p>
<p class="null-p">from the vice president's (?) grasp, he happened to bump her (?) head, which caused her hair to float down to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, Ayano-san's hair fell down~" "A wig?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The hair that had fallen to the ground was actually just a wig that resembled vice president Fujimoto's hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, aren't you second-year Kiryuu Keiki?! What are you wearing a female uniform for, you pervert?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a pervert, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, the perpetrator hadn't sprayed milk on Fujimoto Ayano's face. In reality, it was Kiryuu Keiki, who had been wearing a female uniform with a wig on his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The plan Rintarou had come up with was rather simple. If making the girl herself the bait was too dangerous, then someone just had to disguise themselves as Ayano. Though Keiki was certain that Rintarou would be the best contender for this, Rintarou argued that with his small stature, he might be overpowered by the perpetrator.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he hated the idea of being forced to wear a female uniform, Keiki had to follow the plan since he wanted to protect Ayano. Thus, Kiryuu Keiki made his crossdressing debut.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes after securing the perpetrator, the members of the student council gathered in the empty classroom. Shiho, Ayano, Airi, and Rintarou. As a side note, Ayano had dried her uniform during lunch break, so she was no longer in her jersey. On the other hand, Keiki hadn't had time to change, so he was still in his disguise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm surprised you had a skirt that fit me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A previous student council member apparently used this for a special event. The skirt and wig were both in the material room."</p>
<p class="null-p">How did Rintarou even find them?</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Kiryuu-kun, you actually look quite good in a skirt." "Don't say that.."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let Onee-san take a picture to remember this glorious day~" "Please just don't."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was praised by Ayano and threatened by Shiho. There was no end to Keiki's psychological onslaught. The wig was one thing, but the skirt was extremely uncomfortable for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to hurry and change…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can do that after we finish questioning this guy," Airi said. She directed her cold gaze at the perpetrator, who was tied up in a chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki restrained the perpetrator, Rintarou had come out of his hiding spot, a locker in the corner of the room, and helped tie him up. The clown mask had been taken off as well, so the true identity of the perpetrator was made clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it really was the manga research club's doing." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting on the chair with a sour expression on his face was the first-year member of the manga research club, Chouno. The members of the student council all knew him already, leaving no need for a self-introduction. Instead, they jumped right to the main point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I guess it's time to hear him out." "…Hmpf."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki directed his gaze at Chouno, but he just averted his face with an arrogant snort. A perfect act of resistance, but Keiki didn't seem too perturbed by this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you the only one behind all this, Chouno?" "…I have no reason to talk to a pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you do you then. In that case, we'll just take you to the student guidance teacher, and let them take care of the rest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…" Chouno showed clear discomfort at the idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naturally, the manga research club will be held accountable, as well. Even if Onizuka-san herself had no say in any of this, since this was caused by one of her subordinates, her evaluation in the election will sink severely."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…" Chouno grit his teeth at Shiho's remark. After a conflicted silence, he slowly opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The others aren't related to this. I did it all on my own. I wanted Megu- senpai to win no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you go this far for Onizuka-san?" "…Megu-senpai is my benefactor." "Benefactor of what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Keiki's question, Chouno started revealing his reasoning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it's pretty obvious from the fact that I joined the manga research club, but I'm an otaku. If there were a choice between them, I'd prefer watching anime over eating three meals a day. If you gave me a brief description of any slice-of-life work, I'm confident that I could name it in a heartbeat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I…I see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't see how the dots connected in this conversation, but he nodded in mock understanding nonetheless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I started attending high school, I hid the fact that I was an otaku." "Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I'd be the laughingstock of everyone around me. Especially the girls. If I did something as simple as reading light novels in the classroom, they'd think that I'm disgusting. It'd me want to shut myself in at home…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Oh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I went through this back in middle school, I was careful of it in high school, but a bit after my high school debut, a girl in my class happened to find out. I happened to drop my bag in the hallway, and with the bad luck I have, I had ShameCom with me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, isn't that the really dirty one published in a shounen magazine?" "I read that as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">ShameCom, or the full title 'Is it shameless to hope for a romcom in a different world?' was a story about a protagonist being transported to a different world and getting into perverted accidents with the heroines of that world. It was a fairly popular shounen manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The cover of 'ShameCom' is fairly dangerous on its own, so once the girls saw this, they gave me cold gazes and said things like 'Chouno-kun, you still read this even in high school?' and 'Disgusting~ (LOL)' and so on…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That must be tough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel you, my comrade…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Keiki and Rintarou nodded along with Chouno's story. Being spotted carrying a book like that would mean immediate death for boys like them. As fellow men, they had to show sympathy. Behind him, Keiki heard a cold "This is why men are…" from Airi, but he decided to ignore it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, Megu-senpai passed by out of pure coincidence, and she saved me. She said that making fun of things people like is lame, and stuff like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why she's your benefactor."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi reached out to him with a helping hand, pulling him out of the dark abyss. To him, she must have looked like a hero.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hated girls who would treat me badly just because I was an otaku. But Megu-senpai was different. She accepted me for who I was. That's why I joined the manga research club. Because she was also a member."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chouno had been an otaku from the very beginning. Of course he would feel comfortable in a place practically designed for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When Megu-senpai said that she wanted to become the student council president, I of course decided to support her with all I had. Together with the Senpais from the club, we tried to repay our debts to her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There, Chouno's tone of voice dropped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But yesterday, Megu-senpai just looked so hurt and depressed… I thought that it was because she was losing against vice president Fujimoto in the election…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It had been after the incident happened in the library room. Megumi was under the wrong impression that she had been rejected by Naoya, and she had been very depressed. Chouno grew worried about her as a result of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you hung up those pictures."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had been observing the opposition for our election for a while, so I had happened to take a few pictures like that. I know it might sound weird coming from me, but it's your fault for flirting around in places like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I can't say anything against that."</p>
<p class="null-p">They weren't exactly flirting around, but Keiki had to admit that doing something like that in broad daylight had been asking for something like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because Megu-senpai saved me… I wanted to fulfill her wish…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the reason why he had wanted to disturb the current election. He was driven by his desire to cheer up Megumi, but had lost himself in the process.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand your motivation, but that's not good enough of a reason for what you did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Creating weird rumors about Keiki two-timing, splashing Ayano with water, and attempting to do the same thing with milk. No matter what had driven him to do this, it wasn't enough of a reason to just let this slide. Naturally, he didn't seem like a bad person either, but he didn't know when to stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-It's just as Kiryuu-shi said." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around at the familiar voice, Keiki saw Onizuka Megumi, who was standing in the classroom's entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A rather unexpected guest. The sudden appearance of his princess caused Chouno to panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Megu-senpai?! Why are you here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was looking for you because you weren't answering my calls. And when I finally found you, I saw that you were surrounded by the student council, so I listened in for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Judging from that reaction, you probably heard everything, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi ignored Keiki. She made her way straight to Chouno, stopping right in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Megu-senpai, I…" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Facing the boy still restrained on the chair, the girl smiled. "You moron!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only to karate chop him right on the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing?! Working in the shadows without me knowing?! Bothering other people like this?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We wouldn't need a police if everything could be made better with an apology!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lecturing time ensued out of the blue. Rintarou stepped back and watched it unfold, quietly whispering to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it's like some kind of motherly scolding…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the perfect depiction of a mother harshly lecturing her child who had made a mistake. In other words, it was awful to watch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are a moron. I'm glad that you were worried about me, but I can't really be happy at the result."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megu-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apologize to the folks of the student council!" "Y-Yes…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Bearing the full brunt of Megumi's rage, Chouno teared up and quickly did as he was told.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am terribly sorry for troubling you all like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me apologize as well. I'm sorry for putting you all through this because of my carelessness."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chouno and Megumi both bowed down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that it's come to this, I'll have to withdraw from the election. Although I didn't know about it beforehand, I have to take responsibility for Chouno- shi's actions."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way…" Chouno grew pale.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the leader of the group, Megumi was responsible for the actions of her subordinates, so her decision made perfect sense. However, a member of the student council didn't feel the same way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need for that." "Eh, Fujimoto-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The greatest victim of it all, Ayano, spoke up against Megumi's decision. "I don't mind, nor do I want you to take responsibility."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…" Megumi hesitated in response to Ayano's decision. "Onizuka-san, I want to end this election fair and square." "Fujimoto-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's fight fair and square. Those were the words from Megumi at the</p>
<p class="null-p">beginning of the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… are the others really fine with this… Even Kiryuu-shi…?" "Sounds good to me. Fujimoto-san is our boss right now, after all." "If Ayano-senpai says so, then I won't argue against her decision." "Sounds fine by me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm leaving everything related to the election to them, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nobody dared to speak against Ayano's decision. Keiki, Airi, Rintarou, and even Shiho all put faith into her decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I understand. But, now that I'm in, I won't be holding back, okay?" Megumi yet again declared her intentions with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's what I want," Ayano returned a confident smile of her own. Now that things had calmed down, Megumi directed her gaze to Keiki. "By the way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you wearing a skirt, Kiryuu-shi?" "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, it took them another five minutes to explain the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The incident with Chouno came to an end, and Keiki was finally freed from wearing the female uniform after he made his way back to the student council office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Aaaah, wearing pants sure is nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting on a chair, he let out a sigh of bliss, enjoying the familiar male</p>
<p class="null-p">uniform he knew and loved. Shiho had returned to studying for her entrance exams, whereas Airi and Rintarou were both needed elsewhere, meaning that it was just Keiki and Ayano alone in the student council room right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, good work today," Ayano said, setting a cup of black tea down in front of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, thanks for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki thanked her, Ayano sat down next to him. He took a sip of the black tea and voiced aloud something that had been bugging him for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be a bit late for me to say this, but is it really fine to forgive her this easily? If you had announced any part of this incident, you would have won for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It would be troublesome if Onizuka-san withdrew this early." "Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still a secret. I still don't know how things will turn out." "?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had no idea what she was on about, but she apparently had something in mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit of time passed. After Keiki finished drinking his tea, he stood up. "Now then, it's time to lock away this uniform."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki doubted there would ever come a time to use this uniform again. He grabbed his blazer and started heading out with the intention to stuff the uniform away in the material room where it came from again when he realized something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, I still have Chouno's water gun with me." "The one with milk inside?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was a personal item, Keiki had to return this eventually. "There's still some milk in it. I guess I've gotta wash it out first."</p>
<p class="null-p">Things would get a bit unhygienic if he left the milk inside. He decided to rinse out the interior. Keiki fiddled around with the water gun for a bit, only to eventually give up and stare at it, perplexed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? How do you even open this thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was shaped like a pistol, so you could see the contents inside, but he couldn't find any way to open it. Trying out various things-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano moved over to assist Keiki. She got up from her seat and was standing face-to-face with Keiki as her beautiful fingers touched the gun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, be careful, or else-"</p>
<p class="null-p">-Splash. "Fueh?!" "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A misfire. It was caused by the gun suddenly moving and Keiki's finger accidentally touching the trigger. Immediately, the liquid inside was shot onto Ayano's face. Keiki's white liquid unloaded right onto the girl's beautiful cheeks and hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is wrong on so many levels!</p>
<p class="null-p">This sight clearly crossed the boundaries of what was legal. The beloved vice president had turned into a complete mess from the white liquid.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, my face feels so sticky…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wipe it off! Right now! As thoroughly as possible!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki panicked and took out a tissue from his pockets, reaching out for Ayano's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad… If Nagase-san saw us like this…" "What… are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, Keiki was greeted with the sight of the person he didn't want to see at any cost.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi had just returned from her duties, and Rintarou was right behind her. She was giving Keiki a glare cold enough to freeze hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly is going on here?! Why is Ayano-senpai's face all sticky with that white liquid?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano answered Airi's question with slightly flushed cheeks. "Kiryuu-kun sprayed it all on me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's simple answer agitated Airi even further. She cast her gaze downward, her shoulders shaking in rage, and a black aura started to emanate around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You enemy of all women!!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a misunderstanding! The milk was splashed onto Fujimoto-san by accident!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tried desperately to soothe Airi while still wiping Ayano's face. It took a few minutes to clear everything up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sheesh. Why can't you be a normal person for once, Kiryuu-senpai?" "I have no excuses."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know you don't… And after we did our job properly, too…" "Now that you mention it, how did it go with the newspaper club?" Rintarou was the one who answered Keiki's question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They said they would start writing the article immediately." "I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the article 'Two-Timing Doubts' was released, stating that it all was just false information. The article said that the person who had put up the pictures had been discovered, but he had promised to reflect on his actions, so his name was redacted from the article. Thanks to this, Ayano and Megumi would be able to finish their election without much damage to either faction. The rumors about the two-timing would hopefully vanish in light of the final speeches the following day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like we can finally relax a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been very worried about the incident with the pictures, but they had somehow managed to make it through. Right around the time when he went to have a more relaxed talk with the student council members, his phone started vibrating. It was an actual phone call, and the one calling him was Yuika-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Yes, hello?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, Keiki-senpai.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he answered the call, he heard a rather meek voice. "Yuika-chan? What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please save Yuika…she doesn't know what to do anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A zombie appeared in the library room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The heck are you talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's a rather troublesome customer, and he seems to be an acquaintance of yours, so Yuika thought you might be able to help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know any zombies, though…" Who could she be talking about?</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, that third-year student with the bad look in his eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It finally clicked for Keiki. "Is it Inui-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Onizuka Megumi's childhood friend, and the upperclassman she had feelings for. When he heard that this very Inui Naoya had turned into a zombie, Keiki quickly made his way over to the library room.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: Scream your fetish at the center of the world</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuika requested his assistance, Keiki quickly made his way to the library room. After he met up with his fellow library committee member, she guided him to the table with the problematic student. The male student had the eyes of a dead fish in the truest sense of the word. He sat in his chair, vacantly staring into space.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Inui-senpai?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you asleep, Inui-senpai?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't say anything, I'll stuff a pen in your nostril, okay?" "… "</p>
<p class="null-p">He tried baiting him with many different comments, but to no avail. "No reaction whatsoever…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's just like a corpse…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Yuika had said on the phone, Inui Naoya looked like a living corpse. Even now, his trademark glare he wore glasses to hide was gone. Most likely, he had been acting like this ever since he sat down here. Yuika had a troubled expression on her face because of this Zombie-senpai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's been like this for a while now. Yuika got some complaints from the other students, which is why she was hoping you could do something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, it was probably very hard to work up the motivation to study when someone nearby was acting like this. As a member of the library committee, it was Keiki's duty to deal with this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you do something about him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably. I have an idea as to what caused this."</p>
<p class="null-p">The cause of this was undoubtedly the incident the day before. Back when Keiki was talking with Naoya, he had let out a dejected 'Megumi-chan and I aren't even a good match', which Megumi, who happened to be passing by. This gave her the wrong idea, because she had missed the previous part when Naoya had said that Megumi was too good of a girl for him, but she ran away before he could clear that up.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was probably what had left Naoya in such a lifeless state. That being said, things couldn't stay this way. He had to make a bit of an underhanded move.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inui-senpai…if you don't respond, I'll tell Onizuka-san that you're a passionate and lustful man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you the devil, Kiryuu-kun?!" "Ah, what a great response."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't exactly ignore that, can I…? If you tell Megu-chan something like that, we might not be able to make up ever again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, hearing something like that about the person you have feelings for might be enough to undo a thousand years of passionate love. Meanwhile, Yuika apparently had come up with something, and she spoke up with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Keiki-senpai, Yuika heard that you like cute girls with slight sadistic tendencies, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you not make up fetishes for other people?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Otherwise people would think less of him as a human being. He liked cute girls, naturally, but sadistic girls were outside of this strike zone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason you turned into a zombie is because of what happened yesterday, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Exactly." Naoyam said with a grim expression. "After that, I couldn't get a hold of Megu-chan, and even when I went to her classroom, she wasn't there… it's like she's avoiding me, like she doesn't even want to see me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person sure is negative, isn't he?" "Well, it did take a lot out of him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the sounds of it, Zombie-senpai was rejected by Onizuka-senpai?" "Well, not exactly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, the circumstances were much more complicated. Keiki couldn't directly talk about Megumi's feelings in front of Naoya, so he had to cover it up to at least some degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… I can't go on anymore. Megumi-chan hates me now… I was rejected two times in such a short period. I really am no good…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Calm down! Rinko is a boy, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second, Zombie-senpai was rejected by a boy…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, he confessed to Rintarou when he was in his female uniform and was rejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing the short explanation, Yuika made a sort of 'What a mess' expression. And you couldn't really blame her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inui-senpai, are you really going to give up?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You like Onizuka-san, don't you?" "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you know the reason why Onizuka-san wants to become the next student council president?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Well… Because she got fed up with the boys from the manga research club, and she wants all the other boys to serve her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Way off."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had to respect his creativity, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san is working hard for your sake, Inui-senpai." "What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't tell you any more than that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was barely within the acceptable range of things he could say. The only reason he told him was because he wanted him to know how hard she was working for his sake. The rest should be heard directly from her mouth, so Keiki stopped himself there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, come watch Onizuka-san tomorrow during her speech. You might be able to understand why she wants to become the student council president."</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely, everything would end tomorrow. The long election battle, as well as the misunderstanding between the two childhood friends. Because of that, Keiki wanted him to work hard as well. Not even counting the results of</p>
<p class="null-p">the election, he wanted them to be happy in their love life.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, the last day of the election week arrived. After lunch break came to an end, the five key players of the Fujimoto faction gathered next to the stage of the gym hall. Ayano, Keiki, Airi, Rintarou, and even Shiho were all present for the occasion. Most of the student body had made their way to the gym hall already and were sitting in chairs, waiting for the beginning of the ceremony.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the point of view of the students, the right side of the stage belonged to the Fujimoto faction, whereas the left side belonged to the Onizuka faction. Soon, Ayano and Megumi would give their respective speeches, which would be followed by the final, definitive election. In terms of school events, this was even bigger than the culture festival. Not to mention that one of the candidates had announced a ban on romantic relationships if she won.</p>
<p class="null-p">Depending on the outcome of this election, the school would change drastically, so naturally many students were curious about what the two girls had to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou poked his head out from behind the stage."Woah, there's so many people," he muttered as he ran his gaze through the gym hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I feel nervous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not even going out there, are you, Mitani?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you nervous too, Ai-chan? Your legs have been shaking for a while now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-They aren't… Also, can you stop calling me Ai-chan out of the blue."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the confident and collected Airi was overwhelmed by this atmosphere in front of her. Meanwhile, the main actor Ayano was sitting on a metal chair, waiting for her turn. She might not look like it thanks to her lack of expression, but it was obvious that even she had to be nervous, so Keiki called out to her in slight concern.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, you nervous?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am a bit nervous, but if you were to grace me with your underwear, I might be able to do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, you seem just fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">She did seem a bit anxious, but if she could say something like that, she would definitely pull through. Relieved by this, Keiki relaxed a bit, and Shiho took the chance to approach him from behind and whisper into his ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the doubts about your two-timing have been cleared up, huh?" "Yeah, thankfully."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But two-timing is quite the immoral situation, right? I got so aroused trying to figure out who was the actual wife between Ayano-chan and I~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't see a reason why you had to tell me this right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The rumors about him two-timing had been resolved thanks to the article from the newspaper club. To be fair, most of the students had already been sceptical about the rumors. Most held the opinion that a completely normal and boring student like Keiki wouldn't be able to win over two beauties from the student council just like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was true, but he still felt a bit hurt after being forced to accept it, and his manly pride suffered from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much for waiting. Our preparations are complete, so now we're ready to hear the speeches from our student council president candidates."</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice of a female student could be heard coming from the speakers hanging in the gym hall. She was probably the emcee of the event. The broadcast club was in charge of officiating the event, and they occupied a small room at the side of the stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First we'll start with the representative Onizuka Megumi, who is currently</p>
<p class="null-p">part of the manga research club."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi entered from the opposite side of the stage. The final boss standing in Ayano's way, the princess of the manga research club. She, a mere student, had fought her hardest against the fan favorite, the current vice president of the student council. You had to admire her skill for coming this far, especially considering how close their vote counts were getting.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her freshly-cut hair swaying gently, she walked onto the stage. Carefully observing her surroundings, she started with a small bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Onizuka Megumi of class 2B, and I am a candidate for the position of the student council president." Her voice was calm and collected, and it filled the silence inside the gym hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano watched this in awe, and a voice leaked from her mouth. "Onizuka-san is so calm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she was the current vice president, and a current member of the student council, Ayano was used to talking in front of other people. Considering that, you would think that Megumi would have a bit more problems with an event like this, but the way she acted in front of the crowd was as calm and collected as could be.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what is she planning on doing? Even if she's gambling on her ban of romantic relationships, I doubt that she would be able to get many more votes this late into the game…</p>
<p class="null-p">From a raw percentage of possible votes, Ayano still had the lead. The Ayano faction had taken care of the two-timing doubts as well, meaning that this should be an easy victory if nothing else happened. Megumi would need a surefire way of capturing the hearts of the listeners at the last second with her speech.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is Onizuka-san we're talking about. She might still be hiding</p>
<p class="null-p">something…</p>
<p class="null-p">This is Megumi. She created her own small manga in order to gain votes from the readers. It wouldn't be weird if she had a secret ace in the hole. However, all Keiki could do was wait for Megumi's next words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…First, let me say something upfront."</p>
<p class="null-p">With the student council, teachers and the entire student body watching, Megumi took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All normies should just explodeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a voice loud enough to fill the ears of everyone listening, she screamed words of resentment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everybody listening to her suddenly became very confused. Who could blame them, considering a turn of events such as this? Keiki could hear people mumbling, asking questions such as 'Eh, what?' or 'Normies?' or 'What's she on about?' and so on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, Keiki was no exception. The other members of the student council were at a similar loss for words. Even the teachers on the side looked like they were thinking of interjecting, but it seemed that they respected the authority of the students in this event, so they let the speech continue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing is, I actually had my relationship go up in flames the other day. I found out that the person I like actually has absolutely no interest in me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no mistaking it. She was talking about Naoya. He had been belittling himself, seeing himself unworthy of standing beside a wonderful girl like Megumi. She herself had heard that and taken it the wrong way. It was a fatal misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never imagined that not being able to be loved back, not being accepted by</p>
<p class="null-p">the person I like, would be this tough. If I knew that I would feel this miserable, I would have rather not fallen in love in the first place." With calm words, the girl laid bare her deepest feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being unable to confess to the person you love directly can cause a lot of heartache. For Megumi, seeing her love of many years break into pieces like this must have been a bigger shock than any of the listeners could imagine. After all, she had gone as far as to cut her precious hair. Like cutting off her broken heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the same time, I was forced to watch all the lovey-dovey couples at school. There's other people suffering from a broken heart, but they all just go at it anyway, living their lives in happiness."</p>
<p class="null-p">This is probably how Naoya felt after being rejected by Rinko.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is why I decided to become the student council president and ban all romantic relationships! Call it oppression, call it old-fashioned, all of that doesn't matter! The flirtatious, lovey-dovey couples are too much to bear, and I can't stand it anymore!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Megumi's passionate words, several students in the crowd audibly agreed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't flirt at school!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This reaction was more intense than Keiki had imagined. A lot of people must feel oppressed because of the amount of couples walking around at school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everybody who is fed-up with these normies ruining my fun at school, please vote for me! We will banish all couples!" Megumi finished her speech with a bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">After watching this powerful and overwhelming performance, Keiki could only mutter in a daze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She sounds just like a dictator…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt like he was riding on a tumultuous roller coaster. Going around calling people 'normies' was all kinds of prejudiced, and yet she had garnered a lot of support with her agenda for banning romantic relationships. Setting aside if her plans were good or bad, she definitely had the charisma she needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm… Onizuka-senpai isn't half bad…" Airi said with a bitter expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder if Onizuka-san's feelings got through to Inui-senpai…</p>
<p class="null-p">He must be out there somewhere, listening to that speech, so hopefully he understood Megumi's feelings. Was he able to understand why Megumi decided to run for president? Either way, Keiki's role as matchmaker was done now. What happened now was up to the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Megumi made her way back to the side of the stage, the moderator continued with the program.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much, Onizuka-san. Now, we would like to move on to the next candidate. The current vice president of the student council, Fujimoto Ayano-san, if you would."</p>
<p class="null-p">When her name was called, Ayano stood up, and her allies gave her soft words of encouragement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-senpai, you can do it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the real deal, Ayanon-senpai!" "Ayano-chan, fight!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're nervous, then imagine that everyone in the audience are pumpkins."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yeah." When the four of them tried to cheer her up, Ayano gave a calm smile. "I'm going."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano slowly and calmly made her way onto the stage. The sounds of her footsteps echoed inside the quiet gym hall. With every student watching her, Ayano stopped in the middle of the stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Fujimoto Ayano, a student in class 2A, and I am running for student council president. Today, I would like to talk about the student life I would like to achieve," With a confident tone, Ayano finished her first greeting. "When I first started attending this school, I didn't think that school was fun. I was introverted, and I didn't enter any clubs. All I did was focus on studying."</p>
<p class="null-p">She began describing what she had mentioned to Keiki before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But when Takasaki-senpai invited me to the student council, I started enjoying my days a bit more. The job is a lot of work, of course, but I gradually started looking forward to spending my time in the student council. That eventually led up to the point when I started to like this school."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because she had joined the student council, her previously boring student life found meaning. Whether it was studying, clubs, or love, everybody had their own idea of what made an ideal student life. For Ayano, it was the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is why I want to create a way for everyone to enjoy their days here as well," Since she was used to talking on stage, Ayano calmly directed her words at the students in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki watched over her in silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's Fujimoto-san for you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her speech was perfect for grasping the hearts of the listeners. She even managed to recreate the beautiful smile that was shown everywhere on the election posters. Fujimoto said that she had problems talking with people face-to-face, and yet here she showed no signs of that being a problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">The contents of the speech were something that Ayano and Keiki wrote together. In her case, it was better to reveal her true feelings as directly as</p>
<p class="null-p">possible, so they made sure to put them into the manuscript. The wish for all students to enjoy their student lives how they wanted. This feeling was something that Ayano always held in mind. Their goal was to communicate it clearly to the other students.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Finally, I want to say that I disagree with the statement that love and romantic relationships are not needed."</p>
<p class="null-p">In her conclusion, Ayano made a counterargument to Megumi's statement. She must have added this in on the spot. Of course, that wasn't a problem by any means, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I personally think that falling in love with someone is a wonderful thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, why was it that…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking about the person you like gives you strength, and seeing that person smile makes you happy as well. Just by spending time with them, you feel warm inside."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, her words…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your heart starts to beat faster, you start to grow restless, you're filled with a desire to spend more time with them. You look forward to seeing them again."</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded like she had experienced this personally-or was that just Keiki's imagination?</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that having the person you love not return these feelings can be heart-wrenching. Loving can hurt you in the process. But I still don't think that falling in love is wrong, and I want to make a school where experiencing this happiness is possible-" Standing tall on the stage, the girl faced the entire student body. "Everyone, please lend me your strength."</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone there was entranced by the girl's speech. There might be no 'correct' way to spend your school days, and probably not everyone shared Ayano's feelings. Some probably agreed with Megumi more. But, even so-</p>
<p class="null-p">I really prefer a school built by Fujimoto-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki heard her saying this, he had to admit it yet again. Though it might not change much from how the school was now, if it only became a tiny bit more enjoyable, that would be more than enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">With this, Ayano's speech should have come to an end. "Vice president, do you have a person you like then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A male student called out to Ayano, asking a question that a lot of people probably had. And in response, Ayano-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">She accepted the question with a soft smile. "I have unrequited feelings for a boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said this, the entire hall let out a roar of excitement. Not only because of her words, but also Ayano's slightly flustered reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayanon-senpai sure is bold!" "Ayano-senpai, so you really…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now this development is what I like to see~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing Ayano's confession, the three girls from the student council also reacted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san has a boy she likes…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only Keiki had a confused expression on his face. An extreme smell fetishist, the vice president, who only cares about a boy's odor, has unrequited feelings? She would be interested in a boy completely unrelated to the boy's odor? Though Keiki felt like it was a bit rude to think that, he could not imagine this being true.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This will be all for my speech. Thank you very much for listening."</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing her speech, Ayano bowed once again. Immediately, the student body burst into a roaring applause. Ushered out by applause and cheers, Ayano returned to the side of the stage, and the moderator spoke up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much, Fujimoto-san. Now that both speeches have come to an end, I would like to move on with the final election. Please return to your designated classrooms, and fill out the voting ballots that were handed out previously."</p>
<p class="null-p">This marked the end of the election week. All they could do now was wait for the results to be announced. The main conflict of this election was the differing opinions on love and romantic relationships at school. Would you protect the freedom of this school, or would you forbid the normies from flirting at this school?</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After school, Keiki and the others gathered around the desk inside the student council office, waiting for the results to be announced. The speech had come to an end without incident, and the voting had gone smoothly as well. The election management committee was working on counting the votes, so the results should be announced soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now I'm getting really nervous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess even Shiichan-senpai gets nervous. Then again, who wouldn't be?" "No need to worry. Ayano-senpai will win."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as they said, Shiho, Rintarou, and Airi were all looking pretty nervous as they waited for the broadcast. Ayano, for her part, had a blank expression as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. You'll win for sure." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tried to give Ayano some peace of mind, but who could blame her for being nervous? Waiting for results, especially for something so important, was always scary.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they had waited in suspense for a few minutes, the promised time finally arrived. A short 'Ding dong ding dong' sound came from the speakers in the room, and the broadcast started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello everyone, this is Kurahashi from the broadcasting club."</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice was the same as the moderator from a few hours prior. She gave a light greeting and immediately moved on to the main topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are still counting the votes, but we already have a definite winner."</p>
<p class="null-p">From the sounds of it, they had already determined who they thought had won. Just like an actual election, a winner had been decided without all the votes being counted to the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's finally time…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The election week, which had started the previous Monday, would now come to a complete end with the announcement of the results.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The result of the voting-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">All of the council members swallowed nervously. The silence felt awfully long, even though it was just a mere fragment of a second before Kuruhashi- san boldly announced:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto Ayano-san has been voted in as the new student council president!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright!" "We did it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Rintarou jumped up from their seats, high-fiving each other. "Ayano-chan, good job out there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"An expected result."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho and Airi relaxed as well. At the same time, Keiki's phone went off as he received messages from Shouma, Koharu, and the girls from the calligraphy club, all congratulating them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, the person in the middle of it all, Ayano, let out a sigh, showing a relieved smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Congratulations, Fujimoto-san." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano nodded as she stood up from the chair, facing everybody.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won because of everyone here. Really, thank you so much." Flashing a smile, she gave a slight bow, thanking the rest of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, the other members all gave smiles of their own. "It's the birth of a new student council president, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From now on, Ayano would have to schedule the student council work. She had already shown her potential in this through the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki watched this sight in appreciation. Shiho came up and leaned against Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for supporting Ayano-chan. It's all thanks to you acting as her secretary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because Fujimoto-san works as hard as she does."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So humble~ Should I pat you on the head again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd rather you didn't. It might turn into another scandal." "Ahaha~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki still vividly remembered Shiho burying his face in her chest, which had led to a scandal. Granted, the experience in itself wasn't anything he'd complain about, but if she did that again, Airi wouldn't let him off the hook easily. Seeming satisfied with just teasing her Kouhai, Shiho spoke up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that Ayano-chan will be succeeding me, I'll have to take care of a lot of stuff. Not to mention that we have to take down all the election posters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, I completely forgot about that," Rintarou's eyes opened wide. "Hehe, I remembered, naturally," Airi said with an air of confidence. "Well, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">The election only came to an end once all the posters were taken down and all formalities taken care of.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's still lots to do, but let's finish this with a bang!" "Yeah!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she was close to retiring, Shiho acted like a proper student council president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I guess this Onee-san has to work hard as well~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?" Airi glanced at Shiho's in confusion. "Don't you have to prepare for entrance exams, Shiho-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…" The former student council president froze up. "…Shiho-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh… well, you know, Airi-chan, I could barely participate in the election, so I thought I should at least help out at the end…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do! Your exams are much more important, so leave the rest to us!" "Ehhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No buts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon, Shiho was being scolded by Airi. "Nagase-san sure is reliable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she might be a better fit for student council president than me." "Might be, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Back when Keiki had first met her, Airi seemed like she would be on the 'Ban All Romantic Relationships' faction, but as of recently, she had started to grow a bit more kind, even towards the men she previously hated so much. She was resolute, yet kind, and showed great leadership skills. Airi might even follow in Ayano's footsteps once Ayano had to retire from the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Now that you're the actual president, you need a vice president, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've already decided on who I want." "Eh, who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no, that ain't happening." "Shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably hadn't been serious to begin with. But who could it be, then?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, Kiryuu-kun?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you join me for a bit after this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Ayano stepped out onto the rooftop. There, they were greeted by someone. With her hand on the fence at the edge of the roof, Megumi watched the setting sun, and Keiki called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Oh, Kiryuu-shi and Fujimoto-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Megumi turned around, her eyes opened in surprise. "Why are you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We went to the manga research club's clubroom, and they told us you'd be here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chouno and the other two students had told Keiki and Ayano where Megumi would be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We talked a bit. They were all a bit sad because you lost the election," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But they also congratulated me," Ayano added.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. They're otaku, but they're all good people. They put up with my selfishness the entire time. I can't thank them enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the tall Inooka-senpai and the slender Shikagawa-kun all seemed to be good people after talking with them for a bit. They congratulated Ayano, and Chouno apologized several times for what he had done. Seeing that they were willing to help Megumi in her election this much, it was obvious that they'd be good people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me say it as well. Fujimoto-chan, congratulations on winning the election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You fought your hardest though, Onizuka-san," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I sure did, but now I feel a bit pathetic after running my mouth like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true." Ayano shook her head. "You were a tough opponent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks. I guess I wasn't half bad then." Megumi gave an embarrassed laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she spoke up like she remembered something. "So, did you want something from me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Fujimoto-san said she had something important to talk about." "Fujimoto-chan did?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah," Ayano nodded, taking one step forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two girls faced each other, Ayano looking at Megumi like she was about to confess to the person she liked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san…" "Y-Yes…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I always thought that you were a good person, Onizuka-san." "…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fueh?!" Ayano's words left Megumi in shock. "A-A confession out of the</p>
<p class="null-p">blue like that?! I'm happy you feel that way, but I like boys, so I can't reciprocate your feelings!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant." Ayano quickly cleared up Megumi's misunderstanding. "I want you to become the new vice president, Onizuka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, vice president?" "Yes, vice president."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not your girlfriend, Fujimoto-chan?" "I'm not recruiting for that." "Basically, you don't like girls?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like boys."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, don't scare me like that! I thought I was about to start a forbidden relationship!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, she had been looking at the situation from yuri-filled glasses. Luckily, Airi wasn't here to get fired up over it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… why? You said you wanted me to become your vice president?" "Yup, I said that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you'd be a perfect fit, since you're able to get the boys to obey your every command."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's what you thought of me…" Megumi made a bothered expression. "That was just a joke. Half of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So half of it was your true feelings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The biggest reason is that I thought it'd be fun if you joined." "Ugh…" Megumi grimaced at Ayano's honest reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a slightly resentful glare, she looked over at Keiki. "Fujimoto-chan doesn't play fair…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been asked to become Ayano's secretary the same way. When she asked him for that, he had trouble turning her down. From how things looked, it was the same for Megummi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I will become your vice president." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The student council sounds fun. But I won't give up on the manga research club, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, a new member joined the student council. Megumi had shown her talent during the previous election, so she would without a doubt do a good job as the vice president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good for you, Fujimoto-san." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">If Megumi had withdrawn from the election, she most likely wouldn't have accepted this offer either. Ayano had seen this far ahead, but had wanted to battle fair and square, all to gain another reliable student council member.</p>
<p class="null-p">"With this, Ayano-san's case is done." "Hmm? There's still more?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It seems like someone else also has something to talk to you about, Onizuka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano turned to the side, showing the person standing behind her. When Megumi saw the person standing in the doorframe at the top of the stairs, her mouth fell open in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nao-chan?!" "Hey, Megumi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">The person gently waving his hand back was Inui Naoya. He wasn't wearing his glasses, and he flashed an uncomfortable smile as he made his way towards the group.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why is Nao-kun here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We met him on the way here. Apparently, he was looking for you as well, so we took him with us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, he had been on standby until Ayano had finished her request. Not because of the usual 'Ladies First' rule, but rather because his topic was a bit heavier than Ayano's. Thus, Ayano made room for him, and he stepped up and stood in front of Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megumi-chan, you cut your hair." "Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really suits you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! …T-Thanks…?" Megumi clearly didn't expect to be praised for her new hairstyle.</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have been flustered at the sudden appearance of the person she had</p>
<p class="null-p">been trying to avoid.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard your speech, Megumi-chan. In the middle of it, I felt a strong desire to clear up the misunderstanding you have."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Misunderstanding…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The day before yesterday, I was in the library room, remember? You apparently thought that I had rejected you, but that's not true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason I said that we weren't a good match wasn't because you weren't good enough. I was saying that I was a good-for-nothing. I don't deserve a wonderful girl like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So…" Megumi's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed to realize what she misunderstood. "…Huh? But, if that was a misunderstanding, then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she got that far, she realized that there was more to it. When she assumed that she had no chance, she had a misunderstanding. In that sense, the opposite of what she had assumed would be true, namely that he had feelings of affection for her. When she arrived at this conclusion, Megumi's cheeks turned a faint red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megumi-chan…" "Y-Yesh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I was listening to your speech, it finally clicked. You wanted to</p>
<p class="null-p">become the student council president for my sake, right? Because I was rejected by Mitani-kun. You wanted to ban couples from the school in order to not make me have to go through any sad memories, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… in the end it didn't work out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi said with a shaky expression, but Naoya spoke up. "I'm glad that it didn't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I love you, Megumi-chan." "Fueh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I was depressed, you were by my side, trying to cheer me up, making me realize that I love how kind you are. I've loved you for the longest time, I just didn't realize it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nao-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So please go out with me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone who was a professional confession grader would give this one a perfect score. Her feelings had finally reached him. At the same time, he was finally able to confess the emotions he had bottled up inside of him for the last few years. Finally, the two were on the same wavelength, and Onizuka Megumi's first love could finally begin to bloom. All she had left to do was give a clear 'Yes' as an answer, and it would lead to a happy end-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The unexpected 'No' came from Megumi. Even Keiki and Ayano, who thought they knew the girl's true feelings, couldn't hide their shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why?! Do you hate me, Megumi-chan?!" "That's not it… but not for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not for now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I was saying that I would ban romantic relationships during my</p>
<p class="null-p">election, and then if I went off to get a boyfriend not even a day after that, it would feel like I was betraying the people who supported me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ahh, so that's what you meant…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing that he hadn't been rejected, Naoya sighed in relief. Keiki behind him nodded in agreement with Megumi's logic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If she got a boyfriend now, it'd blow up in her face for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">It definitely was a better idea to wait a bit before they became a couple. That being said, for how long would they have to wait?</p>
<p class="null-p">"So when can we start going out then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see…" Megumi thought about it for a brief moment. "………Two weeks." She muttered. "After two weeks, I'll be willing to go out with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Two weeks… isn't that pretty fast?" "I think so as well," Ayano said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was prepared to hear a month or more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But…!" Megumi averted her gaze, speaking up in a flustered manner. "A- Any more than that, and I won't be able to hold myself back…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huguh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naoya pressed one hand on his chest. Most likely, he had been assaulted by severe pain caused by Megumi's 'gap moe.' Saying that dating right now wouldn't work, but then at the same time stating that she wouldn't be able to wait too long. It was a perfect move from a maiden in love.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"This is bad. Onizuka-san is too cute…" "Yup, even I feel embarrassed now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Ayano exchanged short glances, both blushing as well. Since he was at close range, Naoya took even more damage than the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good for you. Now you're glad that you didn't win, right?" "Don't tease me, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Congratulations, Onizuka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're not going out yet, but… Thank you very much," Megumi smiled faintly as Keiki congratulated them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano was elected as the next student council president, and Megumi had found success in her love as well. In short, everyone was happy. Just when Keiki thought it was time to drop the curtains on the whole affair, Megumi remembered something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, why were you even avoiding me in the first place, Nao- kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh right, the two of you were in a sort-of fight, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki still didn't know the reason why they had been avoiding each other. Because of this, things grew awkward between them as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… Megumi-chan found my porn mags, so things kinda grew awkward…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, that's why? I wouldn't hate you because you read porn mags or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you were avoiding me as well, right? If the magazines weren't the reason, then why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was because… you started wearing glasses out of the blue…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Glasses?" Naoya took out his round-lensed glasses, putting them on. "You mean these?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyaaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The second Megumi saw this, she let out what sounded like a moan. It was a sound like a strict and proper office lady who was visiting the zoo for the first time and was seeing pandas in front of her own two eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nao-kun is handsome with glasses?!?!" "Megumi-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san collapsed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naoya was bewildered by the sudden change in his childhood friend, and even Ayano was at a loss. Keiki was the only person who immediately came to a certain conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san, don't tell me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! I actually have a fetish for glasses!" "Ahhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, she was one of 'them.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"My reason for living is to admire boys in manga or celebrities wearing glasses. Adding glasses to a handsome boy is like pairing white rice and miso soup."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A peerless combination, huh?" Like natto and pickled vegetables.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nao-kun was already cool beyond belief, but with those round glasses, I just couldn't bear it! Just getting close to him when he had those glasses on made</p>
<p class="null-p">my heart feel like it would explode!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the reason you distanced yourself from Inui-senpai…" "Wasn't because of the porn magazines…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To sum it up, Naoya wanted to hide his bad glare with glasses (albeit fake</p>
<p class="null-p">ones), which caused their relationship to break up. Since Megumi had a glasses fetish, the stimulation she felt when Naoya had glasses on was too great, which forced her to distance herself from him. Naoya thought that this was because of the porn magazines, so he felt awkward and also kept his distance from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, Nao-kun is the one to blame for wearing glasses like that!" "Megumi-chan is getting angry at me for some ridiculous reason…" "Your glasses… are making me go crazy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then it would be better if I stopped wearing them, right?" "………" Megumi grew quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">She quickly averted her gaze and responded with a pout.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…O-Once in a while should be fine? If you choose the right place and time… I wouldn't complain…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're like a heroine from a shoujo manga who cares too much about her first kiss…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though her words were the personification of cuteness, the fact that her sexual tendencies, aka her fetish, were so blatant left Keiki unable to fully appreciate the moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe, Nao-kun looks so cool with glasses~" Onizuka-san gazed at Inui- senpai with starry eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the kind of pervert who would get excited about seeing a boy with</p>
<p class="null-p">glasses. Even her childhood friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After Megumi's fetish was revealed, Keiki and Ayano returned to the student council office. Airi and Rinko, who was dressed like a girl again, were working to remove the last traces of the election. They were walking around the area and taking down their Ayano posters. Keiki and Ayano were working as a team now as well, but the girl had an awfully embarrassed look on her face while she took her posters down. The sight of that was so cute that Keiki saved this image in the photo album of his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once all work came to an end, the members left the school building. The sky had grown dark already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, Kiryuu-senpai, I'll be counting on you to safely escort Ayano- senpai home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, gotcha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't act like a wolf and try to take her home, okay? If you do, I'll make sure you end up in hell myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Scary!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase-san's love for Fujimoto-san was strong indeed. Then again, she still trusted him enough to escort her home, so that was nice of her at least.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be taking Ai-chan home, so no need to worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't need any help. A boy wearing a female uniform is more dangerous than any suspicious person around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, don't just call me Ai-chan out of the blue like that." "Ehhh? It's cute though~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two first-years Airi and Rinko made their way home, having an exchange as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The two of them sure are close, aren't they?" "They sure are on the same wavelength, at least" "I guess we'll head home, too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Ayano followed suit, walking along the road next to each other. Though it barely snowed in this town, the air was still cold during the December days. Ayano's cheeks were growing red from the cold air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for helping me in the election." "You're welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">Walking slowly, the two exchanged simple words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you've decided on the new vice president, there's no need for me to stay your secretary anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're fine with it, I wouldn't mind employing you from here on out as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I'll have to decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had his own life to worry about. He had taken a long break from his duties as a library committee member, and he hadn't shown up to the calligraphy club for a while either. He couldn't stay with the student council forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you really saved me. I want to repay you in some way, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That won't do. You deserve proper compensation for all the hard work and hardships you've gone through. If you desire it, I wouldn't mind giving you my panties right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to do any of… Wait, don't start flipping up your skirt!" Keiki frantically stopped his classmate from taking off her panties while they were walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll hear out any request that you have, Kiryuu-kun." "Anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anything. As long as I can do it." "Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having no limit applied to what he could ask for actually made it more difficult for him to choose. The first thought that came to his mind was Ayano-san wearing a bunny costume.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu-kun, you pervert." "I didn't say anything yet…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your face made it obvious that you were thinking something lewd."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wasn't thinking about anything like that! I just thought that you might look good in a bunny costume!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think a bunny costume is plenty indecent." "Seriously…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, a bunny costume was lewd. Even though the girls from the calligraphy club all practically jumped at the chance to wear one. Keiki's head must have started rotting from being surrounded by perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want to see it, I wouldn't mind wearing it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly speaking, he wouldn't mind seeing it. But, asking for such a thing from a classmate wouldn't sit well with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll give it some thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">He hasn't helped her because he was hoping for a reward in the first place. For now, he decided to keep it in the back of his mind and ask her for a favor when something else came up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Kiryuu-kun, was it really fine to help me out like that?" "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have end-of-term exams next week." "…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the sudden appearance of those words, Keiki froze mid-stride. "Sorry, Fujimoto-san, could you repeat that… one more time?" "We have end-of-term exams next week."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh lord…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, December of every year was the busiest month. Though you could look forward to Christmas and New Year's, you had to first overcome your exams.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad… I didn't study at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been busy with the election, and hadn't prepared for the exams in the slightest. Not to mention, since this was the end of the term, the range of topics covered on the exams was usually much wider. Worst-case, he could fail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, please help me with my studies!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto Ayano was a genius who was always graded in the top ten students of her year. You couldn't ask for any better study partner.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus Keiki used his special right to request anything from Ayano not even ten minutes after he had received it.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: Not knowing the circumstances, the classmate approaches relentlessly still</p>
<p class="null-p">The day after the election, 9am on a Saturday. After finishing breakfast with his little sister Mizuha, Keiki made his way back to his room and sat at the desk. He opened his workbooks and notes and set down a cup of coffee next to it. Naturally, it was pure black coffee to fight off sleepiness, devoid of any milk or sugar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's do this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking his favorite pen in hand, he started tackling the world history problems first. Ayano had promised to help him with his studies, but the plan was for her to come over in the afternoon. He had to prepare for the test by himself as much as possible, so he decided to focus on subjects that required learning dates and names by heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like it makes any difference, but why are there so many nobles and politicians who ruined their own reign by oppressing the people…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki knew that taxing people too much could incite revolt. Then again, the problems going on today made it apparent that humans weren't able to learn from past mistakes either. The same could be said of Keiki, who had gone through the ordeal of emergency cramming right before exams time and time again. But that was a different topic right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was just getting into the groove of things when he heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, can I come in?" "Sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he gave permission, Mizuha showed herself, wearing her casual clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have a visitor, Nii-san." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Who might it be? It was still too early for Ayano to show up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha took a step to the side and the guest showed their face. They were wearing familiar clothes: a blouse and long skirt. It was the president of the calligraphy club with her purse on her shoulder and her coat in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Keiki-kun. Your pig slave came to greet you." "That's quite an awful greeting for this early in the morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">What was this pervert saying, not to mention in front of Keiki's little sister? "So what brings you here today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard you were pent up in a lot of ways, so I came here to teach you with every fiber of my being."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All that I'm 'pent up with' right now is studying for exams."</p>
<p class="null-p">He'd prefer it very much if she didn't phrase things in ways that could easily be misinterpreted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So are you going to teach me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might not look like it, but my grades are quite excellent."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki was a genius. You would often forget about it with… well, how she acted, but when it came to studies, she was indeed a reliable student.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how did you know about my current situation?" "Fujimoto-san tweeted about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san uses Twitter?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was quite the unexpected shock for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, look at this," Sayuki showed him her phone's screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown there was a tweet from Ayano. 'Tomorrow, I'm studying at my friend K-kun's house. Looking forward to it <3'. Her account name that Keiki saw was 'Ayanon'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So she actually liked that nickname, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the nickname Rintarou used for her, and he was the only person who actually used it. Needless to say, K-kun was obviously referring to 'Kiryuu- kun'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was so jealous when I saw that she'd be studying with Keiki-kun… Wait, no, I meant that I'm worried about my Kouhai's grades, so I came to help you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not even trying to hide your true intentions, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't allow Keiki-kun to engage in SM play with any other pig."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the only person who would want to do that in the first place… Well, just come in for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for intruding."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki seemed awfully happy as she quickly walked inside the room. "I'll be in my own room." Mizuha said, only to turn around one last time</p>
<p class="null-p">before she walked out. "Studying is great and all, but don't do anything weird, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Even I wouldn't use this chance to give Keiki some health and physical education while you're home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, don't do that even when Mizuha isn't home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this really going to be fine?" His little sister gave Keiki a sharp glare.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, she had already seen countless times just how untrustworthy Sayuki could be. Mizuha eventually went back to her own room, though she showed obvious anxiety upon doing so. She left the two of them behind her as she closed the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki immediately felt tired right off the bat, but time was not something he could waste. They wouldn't be able to study well at Keiki's desk, so he quickly moved the necessities over to the table in the middle of the room and prepared cushions for them to sit on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what subjects are you having the most trouble with?" "This time around, probably math."</p>
<p class="null-p">With this, their private studying session began. Each of them ended up studying for their own subjects, but Keiki asked for assistance whenever there was something he didn't understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was a bit worried at first, but this seems to be going just fine…</p>
<p class="null-p">To Keiki's surprise, Sayuki didn't try anything weird. To be honest, Keiki knew she wouldn't try anything crazy with Mizuha next door, but he had prepared himself for at least a slight amount of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">When you look at her like this, she really is a beauty…</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a beauty in anybody's eyes. Her skin was as white as snow. She had</p>
<p class="null-p">long, glossy black hair. Her body proportions were overwhelming. Even though he knew her true personality, being alone with her like this caused his heart to still beat faster than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, the way you're holding the pen is completely wrong." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unbelievable. It's painful to watch." "It's that bad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had never really bothered with anything like holding a pen correctly, but if a calligraphy genius like Sayuki said so, there must be something to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. I'll teach you the right way. Give it to me for a second." "Ah, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">He reached across the table and handed Sayuki the pen. The girl took the pen</p>
<p class="null-p">in her hand and closely inspected it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Keiki-kun, your thing is so stiff and hard." "Well yeah, it's a pen."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was she just stating the obvious?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not bad, not bad. Look, it's thicker than other people's, I'm sure…" "Because the design is different."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be compared to the ones from other boys in my class." "We are talking about my pen, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, take a closer look. The tip has this slim part on it, so you have to carefully put your fingers around there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like I'm being taught something completely different!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki continued explaining, slowly moving her fingers up and down on the pen. It was clearly not how you would hold it to write anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, the lead broke. I wonder if it'll go 'splurt splurt' now~" "That onomatopoeia is definitely off-topic, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Tokihara Sayuki was still a pervert. When you looked at the motions she was making with her hands, it reminded you less of how you'd handle a pen and more like how you'd handle a you-know-what. As a result, he couldn't focus at all, so he quickly took back his pen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Fujimoto-san was elected the next student council president, wasn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, thanks to everybody who voted for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was a bit sceptical about what would happen with those two-timing rumors that came up, but I'm glad that everything worked out in the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure that her declaration to ban romantic relationships was a bit too harsh of a selling point."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Megumi's had only garnered 30% of the majority vote. She had more than 40% in the previous approval rating polls, but when the final election came around, the students probably gave it a bit more thought. In the end, they probably still admired the fact that a wonderful love could blossom at school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seeing all the couples being lovey-dovey at school is painful to me, but ruining their student life just because of jealousy isn't an option either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreed. I also like watching Akiyama-kun and Ootori-san being lovey- dovey."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really jealous. I'm sure that they're doing a walk-the-dog roleplay every night without telling anybody."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I highly doubt it."</p>
<p class="null-p">In what world are couples actually doing that? Good grief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right at that moment, Sayuki suddenly got up from her seat, moved over next to Keiki, and rested her shoulder against his.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, it's been a while with Keiki-kun~" "S-Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean… what about studying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, you don't like this? Even though you let Fujimoto-san hug you like it was nothing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mentioned it, that whole scandal happened…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chouno had secretly taken a picture of Ayano 'recharging', which caused a great ruckus when he showed that to the public along with Shiho's picture. Naturally, that rumor had reached Sayuki's ears as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pulling her away from him, Sayuki looked up at Keiki. "…Do you prefer Fujimoto-san after all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't even ask me for help with your studies…" Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm clever as well, you know…" Keiki's upperclassman averted her gaze with a pout.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you actually in a bad mood, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even after the election was over, you never came to the clubroom. Of course I would be lonely. I'm your loyal dog."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, we had to take care of some stuff after the election as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was worried that you might be taken away by the student council." "Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same thing had happened before. Back when they had to take care of the club debt, Keiki was taken in as a provisional student council member, and had gotten closer to them as a result, which led to a fight between him and Sayuki. She must have come to his house to see if his opinion had changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Fujimoto-san did kinda ask me to be the vice president." "See?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I declined." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san seemed to already know I was going to say that, and apparently she had Onizuka-san in mind anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, that girl is going to be the vice president? …Is that going to be alright?" "She said she would give up on trying to get rid of romantic relationships.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that she'll be getting a boyfriend fairly soon." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that incident, Megumi and Naoya had finally expressed their feelings for each other. Though they said they wouldn't start dating for the next two weeks, who knew if they were actually going to do so or not?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that aside. As my master, you should be reflecting on the fact that you</p>
<p class="null-p">let your precious dog go through sad memories like that." "I don't remember becoming your master."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, this girl had held off on bothering Keiki during the election. She must have been worried, even jealous, but she still trusted Keiki. He decided that it might be fine to spoil her a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Calling her name, he reached out his hand and gently patted her on the head. "I'm sorry for not paying any attention to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hmph… I won't forgive you if that's all." "Then is there anything else you want me to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, we're a boy and girl, alone in a room together…" Flashing a suspicious smile, Sayuki spoke with a provocative tone. "There's only one thing we could do, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">At the Kiryuu residence, Mizuha stopped what she was doing. "…Phew, time for a short break. "</p>
<p class="null-p">Raising her hands, she gave her stiff body a good stretch. After that, her gaze wandered over to the wall. Past it was her older brother's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if Nii-san is okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After letting in his guest, Mizuha had gone to her own room to study herself, but she couldn't help worrying about what they were doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm here, so they shouldn't be doing anything too crazy, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Today's guest was Tokihara Sayuki of all people. The girl in the calligraphy</p>
<p class="null-p">club who had the most lustful desires of all. Nobody would blame Mizuha for being concerned that Sayuki might sink her poisonous fangs into her beloved brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I could go check in on them for a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, she wouldn't be able to focus on her studies at this rate. The other two probably would want to take a break soon, anyway, so Mizuha decided to check on them under the guise of bringing them tea. In order to brew said tea, Mizuha made her way down towards the kitchen. She was passing Keiki's room when-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ahh…Mm…Keiki-kun…You…can't…" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha heard a faint voice and stopped in her tracks. Though it was barely audible, that voice just now definitely belonged to Sayuki. However, her voice didn't sound normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that something was off, Mizuha carefully approached her older brother's room, putting her ear against the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Sayuki-senpai, you've been pent up, I see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-B-Because… I've been neglecting it for a while…" Pent up? Neglected? Are they possibly…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ahh?! Y-You're going way too deep…! It feels so good that I might go crazy…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moan Mizuha heard left her in shock. "I-Is this… possibly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard the girl's voice, which almost sounded like she was moaning in ecstasy, Mizuha fantasized about what the two were doing in that room, and her cheeks started to blush.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ha?! N-No more than thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis?!" "What are you two doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha couldn't allow the two of them to cross the line any further. She flung open the door and jumped inside the room. There, she was greeted by a rather odd scene.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Ear… cleaning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What Mizuha saw was her older brother cleaning Sayuki's ears. She had no idea how this situation came to be, but all her older brother was doing was pushing the cotton swab in and out of the girl's ear. Keiki was seated on the cushion, and the girl's head was on his lap. Mizuha made a puzzled expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing that she had gotten the wrong idea, her panic faded, only for it to become anger for a very specific reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about your studies?" "I have no excuses…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, after that her older brother was forced to sit tight at the desk and focus on his studies.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's anger subsided by the time lunch was finished. Keiki used the time to study a bit more, but not much time had passed by the time Ayano arrived at 1pm as promised. She was wearing a coat with tights and a matching skirt. She gave a slight bow as Keiki came to greet her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for intruding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on in, Fujimoto-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noticing that Keiki seemed already worn out, Ayano tilted her head in slight confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, are you tired?" "Well, a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't exactly tell her what had happened that morning. "For now, let's go up to my room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting on the guest slippers, Ayano followed Keiki up to the second floor. Ayano entered his room without any hesitation at first, but she suddenly came to a halt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I smell… another girl in here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, yeah, Sayuki-senpai was here a while ago." "…Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's a smell fetishist for you. She had picked up on Sayuki's scent that was still covering the room. Then again, Mizuha had done something like that before, so it might just be a special trait for girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You had fun with another girl before me…" "We were just studying normally."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, he kept quiet about the whole ear cleaning part. Keiki sat down on the cushion, and Ayano followed suit after taking off her coat, sitting across from Keiki. She then grabbed her bag and took out workbooks and notes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, what's Kiryuu-san doing?" "She's home. Just studying in her own room."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had excellent grades. Though she couldn't compete with Ayano, she was still in the upper ranks. As a side note, Mao's grades were about at Keiki's level. Just like Keiki, she would pull all-nighters cramming to keep the same grade as always, staying around the average. Because she wanted to focus more on her manuscripts, she only studied enough to avoid failing grades.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for taking up your precious time like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't pay it any mind. I study all the time, and this is to thank you for being my secretary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Also, I stand to profit from this quite a bit." "You stand to what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if you say so. I'll happily take you up on that offer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't hold back," The new student council president puffed out her chest in confidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike Sayuki, who would occasionally bring up dirty jokes, Ayano would take this studying session seriously. Unless she got a sudden urge to sniff Keiki's scent again, which he was very much worried about. That being said, worrying about it wouldn't change anything, so instead he focused on his studies. After opening the various workbooks and resources on the desk, Keiki battled math and physics now that he had help from Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it wasn't the first time she had taught him, Ayano's skills at teaching yet again impressed him. She wouldn't just tell him the answer to a problem he didn't understand, she would guide him to the answer with a few hints, teaching him how to properly use the formulas he needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you really have a knack for teaching people, Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad I could help."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano returned a happy smile after hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm actually hoping to become a teacher in the future." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I really enjoy teaching other people." "Fujimoto-san as a teacher, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He tried imagining it. The sight of Ayano standing at the teacher's desk, wearing a suit, diligently teaching students.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it might suit you." "You think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're good at teaching, so I'm sure things would work just fine." "Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">As a matter of fact, his grades during the mid-term exams went up by quite a bit after Ayano spent time tutoring him. She showed kindness for other people, and she had a knack for figuring out what other people were thinking. Keiki thought that she might be a good teacher.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are amazing, Fujimoto-san. I haven't given my future any thought so far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only on the level of wanting to get a stable job. Like in a big business, or a government official?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds good. And safe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Either way, I'll have to study if I want that future."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had to get good grades to get a stable job. He had to work hard for that future. There were many things that could interest him, but getting good grades was at the center of it all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, why don't I keep teaching you in the future as well?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just leave it to Ayano-san," She smiled confidently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you must be busy as well, Fujimoto-san. Now that you're the student council president, your workload is only going to increase."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still have enough time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if you spend too much time with me, the person you have feelings for will get the wrong idea, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The person I have feelings for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the speech yesterday, you said that you had a person you like, right?" "I did say that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wouldn't it be bad if they got the wrong idea if they saw us together a lot?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was even the scandal that had happened, which probably didn't help Ayano much in that regard either. If they kept studying like this at school, their time spent together would only increase. If that happened, the person Ayano had unrequited feelings for could misinterpret their relationship to be something special.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… why don't we have him get the wrong idea?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki opened his eyes wide at Ayano's words, unable to grasp what she was saying. Ayano just silently moved over to the seat next to Keiki and gave him a tight hug, like a girlfriend would do to cheer up her boyfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"F-Fujimoto-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If they saw something like this, would a boy misunderstand?" "T-That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was hit with a complicated question up close. But he didn't even have the chance to answer her seriously. He was used to her sniffing him to recharge, and she even clung to him at times, but this action had one fatal difference.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wasn't doing this to recharge. Instead, it felt like an embrace of love, which sent Keiki's heartbeat to the highest heights.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Just what kind of situation is this…?</p>
<p class="null-p">In this situation, what kind of misunderstanding would this cause, and who would even have it? Keiki couldn't think straight. He didn't know what Ayano's aim in all of this was. Every part of her that was touching him was awfully soft, and she gave off a really pleasant scent. On top of that, Ayano's smile, which made it look like she was actually enjoying this situation, made Keiki go crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And? Would they get the wrong idea?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My heart's beating so fast that I can't really tell…" "Then it's a great success."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A success in what even?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was too complicated. Keiki couldn't find the right formula to solve it. Even so, the girl seemed very satisfied. She calmly returned to her previous seat, leaving Keiki in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-Well, I'm thankful that you're helping me with my studies right before the exams, but having you teach me all the time is a bit unfair of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I still haven't repaid you enough." "It's more than enough for me, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't accept this. Repaying all debts fully is the duty of the student council president."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There it is, Fujimoto-san's thickheadedness."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that it had come this far, the girl wouldn't step down. She might look docile, but she could be quite obstinate like this, unwilling to bend at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If a private tutoring session doesn't work, then I'll do something that'll feel really good for you, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something that will feel really good?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when he let down his guard, Keiki was met with explosive words. After saying such highly misinterpretable words, Ayano once again pressed forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to heal you, Kiryuu-kun." "D-Does that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A young boy and a girl were alone in a room. What could there be for a girl to do who wanted to make the boy feel good?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to do it for you, Kiryuu-kun…" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, there was only one possible answer to this.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, one room over, Mizuha finished going over her notes for the exams and put down her pen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Phew, that should do it for English."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had taken one last glance over her notes, studying the vocabulary, and had also practiced all the grammar problems that might appear. Since she always paid attention studiously in class, a light review before the exams had always been enough for her. Thanks to this, the exams should prove to be no problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if Nii-san is studying like he should…" Mizuha muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, she directed her gaze at the wall behind which was her older brother's room. Instead of Sayuki, Ayano was now helping him study.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san is a member of the student council, so I doubt she would do anything weird… right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cute. Excellent grades. High morals. A female student you could without a doubt call an honor student. That was the girl named Fujimoto Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, Mizuha was thankful that someone like her was willing to help her brother study. She really was. But…</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looked like Fujimoto-san has taken a liking to Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her interior love sensor was beeping violently. It felt like the gaze Ayano had directed at Keiki was the same as the girls from the calligraphy club. For Mizuha, who had unrequited feelings for Keiki, Ayano might just be another rival.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright, I guess I can go check on them real quick!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A dangerous individual was currently in a room with her older brother, all alone. She couldn't ignore it any longer. She had taken a bath with Ayano during the school trip, so it wouldn't be weird to check on them really quick. Making up excuses mentally, Mizuha left her own room. She stopped in front of Keiki's room and was about to knock when-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…F-Fujimoto…san…I…I can't…" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her older brother's strained voice reached Mizuha's ears. In order to not jump to conclusions about the situation again, Mizuha decided to listen in. She carefully put one ear against the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah?! Fujimoto-san…that's?! Ugh! It…It hurts, but it also feels good…!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing words she definitely couldn't ignore, Mizuha grew pale. He was saying that it hurt, but it also felt good. Combined with this voice that sounded pained yet also awfully blissful. Is this possibly…</p>
<p class="null-p">Nii-san is being attacked by Fujimoto-san?!</p>
<p class="null-p">How could this happen? While she was busy learning English vocabulary in the room next door, the two of them had started something indecent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is Fujimoto-san actually a sadist…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging from her brother's voice, it sounded like some weird kind of roleplay. If that was true, then Ayano could be a pervert on the same level as Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">-No, this isn't the time to be thinking that.</p>
<p class="null-p">If things kept going like this, Mizuha's older brother would be taken to a new world. He would awaken as a masochist, so she had to save him right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha barged right into the room. "…Eh, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was met by puzzled expressions from both Keiki and Ayano. The two of them weren't lying on the bed in each other's arms. Instead, they were still seated on the ground. Keiki was seated on a cushion, and Ayano had both her arms on his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…A massage?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What was happening in her brother's room wasn't a S&M roleplay. Ayano was simply giving Keiki a massage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about your studies?" "I have no excuses…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Keiki was forced to study the entire day without interruptions.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The first day of the week, during lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them finished eating their respective lunches, Keiki and Ayano met up and headed towards the clubroom building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry to make you tag along with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I wanted to thank Koharu-senpai as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano was walking next to Keiki, carrying a pastry box. The kind you'd often see at cake stores and such. Back when the election was underway, Koharu and Shouma alike both helped a great deal, so Ayano made some apple pies for them as thanks. Since her homemade apple pie was far better than something you could normally eat, they would definitely be happy about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">While talking about that day's exams, they went up the stairs and finally arrived in front of the astronomy clubroom on the third floor. After lightly knocking, Keiki opened the door without much hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse… me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He froze up in the middle of the greeting. A scene he would have never imagined to even see in his dreams widened up in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There, there, you're such a spoiled baby, Shouma-kun~" "Gagagugu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside said astronomy clubroom, a certain couple was enjoying a rather unorthodox form of roleplay. Though it would be better off not being described in detail, in short Shouma was acting like a baby while resting his head on his lover's lap, whereas Koharu, playing the role of a mother, was feeding him.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this happen in front of them, Keiki and Ayano froze up. Met with this surreal scene, they both struggled to find the right words, if there even were any.</p>
<p class="null-p">We sure walked into something horrifying…</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he had seen the worst kinds of things in the world when it came to perverted things, even this was too much for him. Right before he turned to leave the two lovebirds alone, he happened to meet Shouma's gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki?! And Fujimoto-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… What's the number for the police again?" "Please don't?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. This is just too much, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Who would imagine finding your best friend actually in a baby roleplay like this? Still, after Shouma pleaded with him, he put his smartphone back into his pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First you were doing this weird little-sister roleplay, and now it's gotten even worse? I feel like you're moving further and further away from me, Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait! This is something that Koharu-chan wanted to do!" "Koharu-senpai did?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki looked like he couldn't quite accept it, so Koharu started explaining.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-san and Yuuhi-san told me that this would be a kind of stimulation for couples so that they could stay in love for all eternity."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is their doing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The older sister Asahi, and the younger sister Yuuhi. The two sisters who wouldn't miss out on a chance to dote on their little brother Shouma. Though they seemed to have accepted the fact that Koharu was dating Shouma, they seemed to enjoy giving advice. Advice that sometimes came a bit too often, and was oftentimes over the top.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai, I don't think you have to believe every single thing they say. A normal couple wouldn't do something like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly speaking, a baby roleplay like this is actually more on the insane side of things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-is that so…?" Koharu acted like this advice was an incredible revelation.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, right when the conversation turned reasonable again, Shouma opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second." "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But being treated like a baby by Koharu who looks like a loli girl mama… doesn't feel too bad, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Police officer, it's this guy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The lolicon was awakening to some new fetish. Maybe Shouma was already beyond saving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Kiryuu-kun, what brings you here?" "Ah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">The baby roleplay made so much of an impact on him that Keiki had forgotten their original goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano took a step forward and handed the small paper box to Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is my homemade apple pie. You helped me so much during the election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waaah! Thank you very much. I love apple pie!" "Please enjoy it as a dessert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll take you up on that offer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We just finished eating our lunch, so great timing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I thought something like this might happen, so I brought a fork already." Koharu put the box down on a nearby table.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she opened it to check the contents, she let out a voice of admiration. "Did you really make these all by yourself, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amazing. You could put this on sale in a store."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the box was a pie, cut neatly in two. Koharu readied some plates, grabbed a piece with her fork, and held it out towards Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun. Here, open wide~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh… Mmm… Woah, this is really good!" "Give me some as well, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Here, open wide~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhmmm… Fuah?! It melts in your mouth!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the two of them very much enjoyed Ayano's high-quality apple pie. Keiki found himself watching them with narrowed gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They just started feeding each other in front of us…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, super bold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if the longer you stay as a couple, the more you become unaware of the people around you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But they look like they're enjoying themselves." "That I can't argue against."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them really looked like they were in bliss. If Megumi had won the election, they wouldn't have been able to enjoy themselves like this anymore. Keiki was able to see this scene because Ayano had protected it, and seeing them like this made Keiki smile as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love sure is great…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought this every time he watched a happy couple. How great it would be if he found someone to do these things with, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also want a cute girlfriend…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had forgotten about this sensation for a while. But, while watching their exchange, he was reminded of his desire to spend his youth with a cute girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, how did the exams go for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the final day of the test period, after all exams came to an end, Yuika approached Keiki like a small puppy as he sat on the chair inside the</p>
<p class="null-p">calligraphy clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is quite confident with her results this time around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I pulled an all-nighter the night before, and I think it worked out pretty well."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had some help as well, so this time his grades should have even gone up. Just then, Sayuki arrived and sat on Keiki's opposite side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I taught you, after all." "Thank you very much for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mizuha scolded them for the ear-cleaning incident, Sayuki had seriously helped Keiki with his studies. There was no doubt about it. His grades definitely would go up because Sayuki and Ayano had spent time teaching him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I should get around the same grades as always." "So you didn't have any problems either, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki directed his gaze over at Mizuha, who was seated across from him. "By the way, about Mao-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Nanjou is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Yuika both directed their gazes at Mao. Her head was buried in her arms as she rested on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This time was pretty bad, apparently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She sure makes it look like it wasn't good…" "Mao-chan, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao shook her head in response to Mizuha's question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not okay at all…I probably barely avoided flunking out… Mama will definitely get angry at me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-san, you call your mother 'Mama', huh?" "That's a bit unexpected."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki agreed with Sayuki and Yuika, but he decided to ignore it and try to cheer her up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, don't sweat it, Nanjou. I doubt you'd fail, anyway. You can just focus on your doujinshi now and get better grades next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" "H-Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Keiki's kindness was met with a harsh glare. "The reason I couldn't study was your fault, Kiryuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? How was it my fault?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had no memory of doing anything that could cause this. "Just what did I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Dick." "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh!" Mao screamed with a beet red face. "Kiryuu's di*k never left my head, and I couldn't study properly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Di*k?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When that word came up, the other three girls jolted upright in shock. "N-Nanjou?! What are you talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since the school trip, an awkward atmosphere had reigned between the two of them. Naturally, the reason for this was the incident back in the open- air bath, where she had accidentally grabbed Keiki's little son. Because of the election however, Keiki had to prioritize other things. As a result, he hadn't had the chance to clear anything up with her, and now it had come around to blow up in his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san? What does Mao-chan know about your di*k?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, have you already climbed the stairs to adulthood…?!" "Please explain yourself, Keiki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, even if you say that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">How could he even hope to explain this? He couldn't tell them that Mao's hand had tightly embraced his son after their dance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is hesitating…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means, Keiki-kun's first…" "Already went to Mao-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But the three girls already jumped ahead and came to ridiculous misunderstandings. They all gave Mao dubious gazes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, we didn't go that far…" Mao said.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they heard that, the three girls sighed in relief. "So Keiki-kun's first time is still safe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is relieved."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still need Nii-san's di*k, so thank God."</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki had been worried as to what they would do, but it sounded like things would end peacefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know the circumstances behind how that happened, but it's not fair that only Nanjou-san saw it, right? I advocate that Keiki-kun takes off his clothes right now to show us as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not a bad idea, considering that it's coming from Witch-senpai." "Then someone grab him and we'll take off his pants."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki, Yuika, and Mizuha all started closing in on Keiki. Just when Keiki was about to give up all hope-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A cold voice came from the calligraphy club's doorway. Standing in front of the door was a female student with a dubious gaze: Onizuka Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slightly terrified by the scene unfolding in front of her, Megumi took a few steps away from the group.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san? What brings you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I've taken up the position of vice president from Fujimoto-chan, I came here to get some documents."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, I heard someone shouting the word 'Di*k' from down the hallway…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please pretend you didn't hear anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go report that the calligraphy club really is a harem paradise, okay?" "Please don't."</p>
<p class="null-p">If she were to report that, the calligraphy club would run the risk of being disbanded again. While Keiki was busy trying to calm the new vice president down, Sayuki brought over a case filled with documents and handed over the</p>
<p class="null-p">files Megumi needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, the club budget expenditures."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much. It helps a bunch that you're keeping it tidy like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai has traumatic past experiences concerning the club budget, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, I was still naive back then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The club had nearly been disbanded because of budget mismanagement on Sayuki's part, so she had learned to be much more careful with the budget since.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, that should be all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi accepted the documents and was about to leave the room when she suddenly gave Keiki a reserved gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, Kiryuu-shi?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you have a moment right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi took Keiki to the place where the scandalous picture with Ayano came into being, in front of a certain vending machine. Holding the documents in one hand, vice president Megumi put a few coins into the vending machine, pressed a button, and handed a canned coffee over to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, my treat." "Ah, thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki accepted the can. It was the same kind of coffee Keiki had treated Megumi to before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did you want to talk about?" "I wanted to thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard about it from Nao-kun. You did a lot of stuff for us behind the scenes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Naoya had told Megumi about Keiki's attempts to get them together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But in the end I did something unnecessary, which almost ruined everything," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was the one to blame for that. I should have known that Nao-kun would never say anything like that about me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, Megumi had jumped to the wrong conclusion rather quickly. But Keiki still felt responsible for Megumi cutting her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm pretty sure that, if it weren't for you, Nao-kun and I would have never ended up like we are now. Both of us are really bad at this sort of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to agree on that front."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi and Naoya both had feelings for the other, but were both unable to take the final step. It was mutual love, but things still almost didn't work out. It had been quite vexing to watch from the outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to you, Nao-kun and I can be together again," Megumi gave a happy smile. "So thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without a doubt, these were words of pure gratitude. Keiki was relieved to know that she was grateful for his meddling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad I could be of help."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been plagued by a feeling of guilt since he had indirectly caused Megumi to cut her hair. But now he felt like this guilt was growing lighter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I definitely didn't expect to be invited to the student council like that, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san had quite the high opinion of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm honored to hear that. I'll try my best to live up to her expectations."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that would be great…" What reliable words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I'm taking more time right now to get used to all of this work, I'm still planning to show up to the manga research club from time to time. The three of them are probably lonely there without me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are the Otasa Princess, after all." "Stop it, that sounds embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, Chouno and the others would definitely be happy if she stopped by.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, the student council has Rintarou with them. Is that going to be fine? He was the cause of this entire situation after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou, full name Mitani Rin. The reason Naoya had been dragged into the depths of the abyss. Would she really want to work in the same environment as him?</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I've been thinking about it for quite a while. It's not like Mitani-shi deserved any blame. Nao-kun just mistook him for a girl and confessed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt relieved to hear this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou is still a good guy, so I'd be happy if you put up with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood," Megumi nodded with a snicker. "You really are a good guy, Kiryuu-shi. You look rather average on the outside, but your looks aren't awful, either. So how come you don't have a girlfriend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I want to know."</p>
<p class="null-p">If there was a reason why he hadn't managed to get a girlfriend yet, he'd love to hear it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This question might be a bit straightforward, but don't you have a girl you like, Kiryuu-shi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not as of right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Even though you're surrounded by beautiful girls?" "Even if you say that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a waste. To be honest, if this was a manga, you'd definitely be the harem protagonist, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Harem protagonist…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki, Yuika, Mao, and Mizuha. All these beautiful girls surrounded him in the club Keiki attended. On top of that, Ayano, Shiho, and Airi were beautiful girls in the student council. Just looking at it from an outsider's perspective, it really looked like a harem, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not really a harem. It's more like a cluster of perverts…</p>
<p class="null-p">The number of girls with fetishes was 100%. Not a single normal girl was to be found in either the calligraphy club or the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I totally thought you had the hots for Fujimoto-chan, Kiryuu-shi." "For Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you devoted yourself to her so much during the election. I thought she was using you because you had fallen for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a terrible misunderstanding…" "But why did you help her, then?" "Well, I had a lot of reasons…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They had already worked together in the student council. They were also friends, but the most prominent reason was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just can't leave Fujimoto-san alone, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">She might look perfect on the outside, but she could be unexpectedly weak. She was confident in the weirdest places. She had this charm that made Keiki want to reach out a hand in help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see. It's true that she gives off vibes like that." "Right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But in the end, you were the only one to reach out and help." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, normal people wouldn't help anybody like you did. That's what makes you a great person, and you have my stamp of approval for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He hadn't expected her to say that. Though he felt awfully flustered, he was also happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you can be more confident, and approach whatever girl is to your</p>
<p class="null-p">liking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, this and that are two different things entirely."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if you don't take proactive steps, you'll never get a girlfriend, right?" "And suddenly you're bringing up logic?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was too logical. Keiki couldn't say anything against that. But if that were the only problem, Keiki wouldn't be suffering this much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really is weird. You want to get a girlfriend this badly, but you won't go on the offensive yourself. You're surrounded by beauties left and right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Won't you at least give it a try?" "There are a lot of reasons, okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were all perverts to the core. If he started pursuing any of them, he'd regret it right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, if you do end up finding a girl you like, you're better off telling her right away, or else you might end up like Nao-kun and I did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's some sage advice from Onizuka-san for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">It sounded awfully convincing coming from her. The two friends had been unable to voice their feelings properly and had missed each other this entire time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even if she says this, I don't have anybody like that…</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't deny that the girls around him were all cute. They really were, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, they're all perverts…</p>
<p class="null-p">One wanted him to become her slave, one wanted him to make her his pet,</p>
<p class="null-p">one used him for BL reference, and another enjoyed walking around without wearing panties. He had trouble seeing any of them as potential love interests.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just for reference, what kind of girl is your type, Kiryuu-shi?" "Hm… If I had to put it into words, I like a normal, kind girl." "Woah, there it is. I can smell the virginity oozing from you." "Well excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, everybody has their own tastes. If you like a normal type of girl, then I'm sure she'll appear eventually."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't give up on his dream of spending a wonderful youth with a cute girlfriend at his side. If there was a good candidate, then he wouldn't mind going out with her, even climbing up the stairs of adulthood with her, but not in this situation where countless perverts were targeting him. Not to mention that his 'De-Perversion' plan still hadn't shown any results.</p>
<p class="null-p">……</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh? Don't tell me. Am I going to spend the rest of my life as a virgin?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki arrived at a terrifying conclusion. He once again made up his resolve to find a girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">* "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a female student listening in on the conversation between Keiki and Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmmm? So normal girls are his type?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She happened to catch the two by pure coincidence, but she had happened to get some highly interesting information in return. While thinking about how to best use this information, she made a cheerful smile.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: She's not a pervert, but apparently a normal heroine…</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, Keiki was plagued by a mysterious dream. When the dream materialized, he stood inside a white room, still wearing his school uniform. Standing in front of him were four brides, the members of the calligraphy club. Not in their school uniforms, but wearing beautiful wedding dresses.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki, Yuika, Mao, and Mizuha all gazed directly at Keiki. Their cheeks were slightly flushed, and their gazes were expectant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun-" "Keiki-senpai-" "Kiryuu-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their voices overlapped as they spoke to the only boy in the room. "Who do you like…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A question he had heard before. "I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside his dream, Keiki started speaking. But before he could give an answer, the dream came to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the dream ended, Keiki opened his eyes. After gazing at his room's</p>
<p class="null-p">ceiling for a few moments, Keiki sat upright. "What a weird dream…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was weird that the members of the calligraphy club had appeared, not to mention as brides. Each and every one looked beautiful enough to make Keiki gulp in admiration. In reality, of course, all of these girls would be more likely to wear a bunny girl outfit. After all, each and every single one of them was a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I'll get ready."</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to shake off the gloomy feeling settling inside of him, Keiki got up from his bed. Though it wasn't snowing outside, December mornings were still awfully cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Around the time classes came to an end, Keiki headed over to the calligraphy club, and now he was sitting in front of a calligraphy paper. The other club members were spending their time in their own way. Keiki took out a bit of calligraphy paper and brought out the tools he needed. Right as he started to write the first letter, Sayuki called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're working on calligraphy yourself, Keiki-kun? That's pretty rare."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm still a club member, so I thought it might be nice to leave a work of my own behind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a great way of thinking. If there's anything you want me to tell you, don't hesitate to ask."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying something that oddly enough was something a club president should say, Sayuki returned to her own work. Keiki for his part focused on his own work, giving it the final touches. What he ended up with was an impactful poster, which had the words 'Recruiting Girlfriend' on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed, just as I expected, my fears are getting the upper hand…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With the ever-present danger and anxiety of possibly staying a virgin for the rest of his life looming near, his instincts were screaming at him to get a cute girlfriend already.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is all because Onizuka-san said something weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">She asked him if he had a girl in mind, and what his favorite type of girl was. That must have been the reason he had such a weird dream like that. After seeing that dream, he found himself unable to calm down, and he was even thinking about it during his calligraphy work.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if you ask me what I want…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wanted to experience a normal love. And yet he had seen a dream where he would end up with a perverted girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">I kept saying that a pervert isn't any good, too…</p>
<p class="null-p">He really didn't have any interest in making a girl his pet, or becoming the slave of one. He wanted to spend a wonderful student life with a normal girl. That wish shouldn't have changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But why can't I calm down at all…?</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't understand his own heart. To put it like how his little sister Mizuha would, it felt like his heart was lost.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhh, enough, enough!</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to shake off this gloomy, hazy feeling, Keiki took out another calligraphy paper and picked up the brush.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's do it!" "What are you doing?" "Woah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice suddenly called out from behind him, which caused Keiki to spin around. As a result, the brush, still covered in black ink, hit said person right across the cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I went and did it-Keiki realized it was already too late. His Kouhai-Koga Yuika, one of the beauties from the calligraphy club-had one cheek covered in black ink. He wouldn't be able to make any excuses about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…" "Ah, well, this is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't good. He had made Yuika angry. He had dirtied her beautiful face. Though he couldn't tell because she had her face cast downwards, she had to have been angry.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this rate, I'm going to have to suffer through another one of Yuika-chan's punishments…</p>
<p class="null-p">She would stomp on him with her lovely legs, whip him, and stuff his mouth full of her freshly-worn panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The slave candidate's body shook in fear just from imagining this. Yuika took out a handkerchief and started to wipe her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sheesh. Be a bit more careful next time, okay?" "………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Keiki, this was quite an unexpected reaction. There were no signs of her acting like she hardcore sadist she actually was. She simply spoke in a calm tone of voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai? What's wrong?" "Ah. Well… aren't you… angry?" "Angry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Normally, you'd say something like 'This calls for some punishment' or 'Get on your knees and lick Yuika's feet', right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Did Yuika ever say something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course you did! About how you want me to become your slave and all."</p>
<p class="null-p">How could he forget? The day he had her freshly-worn panties stuffed into his mouth, along with the confession 'Please become Yuika's slave' after that. She had even tried to force him into becoming her slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if it was on purpose, Yuika wouldn't get angry at you because of ink like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really?" "Yes~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, if she says so… But for some reason, it didn't quite sit right.</p>
<p class="null-p">What happened to Yuika-chan?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was she in a bad mood? Or was it the exact opposite? Keiki for one couldn't imagine her missing out on a chance to punish him like this. But it didn't quite end with that either.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes after this first incident, Keiki was going to put away the tools he used when some red ring-shaped object fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Isn't this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki picked it up, he immediately recognized it. It was an oddly familiar dog collar. The same one Sayuki wore around her neck when she</p>
<p class="null-p">confessed her fetish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh, so that collar was in there, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon spotting the object, the previous owner came walking towards Keiki. Her glossy black hair was flowing and her large breasts were shaking as she approached. Keiki had a bad premonition.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Ah?! This is bad!</p>
<p class="null-p">The masochistic pervert and dog collar had been reunited. This practically screamed that another perverted event was going to happen. Without a doubt she was going to ask Keiki to put the collar on for her. And then she'd do something like ask him to go on a walk with her through the school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki mentally prepared himself for the horror to begin once the girl opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then could you put it away again for me?" "Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… aren't you going to ask to wear it?" "Wear it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You always think about and say really perverted things, right? Like you want to be treated like a dog, you want to wear this collar, and so on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about, Keiki-kun? Why would I want to wear a collar?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki was a masochist who enjoyed being treated like a dog. She</p>
<p class="null-p">always wanted to have a boy spank her butt. Now, though, she was acting like she had never done any of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, are you feeling okay?" "I sure am."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then did you hit your head somewhere?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both my body and heart are in perfect condition." "Ehhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What is going on?</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not just Yuika-chan! Sayuki-senpai is acting weird, too!</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling like something was very wrong, Keiki carefully put back the tools and the collar and returned to his previous seat. He happened to glance to his side where he spotted Mao, who was busy reading something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today she's reading again, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever she was in the clubroom, there were two ways that Mao passed the time. First, she could draw on her BL manga with two boys loving each other dearly and passionately. Second, she could read any sort of book.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's probably some BL manga or novel again… Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't exactly dying to know what it was, but when he looked at the cover of the book she was reading, he was shocked. Something was off. After all, there weren't any naked men on the cover. Instead, the cover depicted a girl wearing a school uniform with sparkles shining all around her.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"…Huh???"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki doubted his eyes. He took a second look. No matter how many times he made sure, it wasn't BL manga. It was a normal shoujo manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou is reading something other than BL stuff?" Had something like this ever happened before? "Hey, Nanjou, what happened to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you're reading a normal book. Normally you just read hardcore BL smut."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?" "Yes, really…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, this sort of book isn't half bad once in a while, is it?" "Ehh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao kept her gaze serious as she returned to her reading. Something really was off. Were they all suffering from short-term memory loss, not to mention at the same time?</p>
<p class="null-p">Now even Nanjou is acting weird…</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he had gotten to this point, it felt like they were planning something. The timing couldn't be any more suspicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't tell me, even Mizuha is…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, Sayuki, and Mao were all acting different from usual. That meant that Mizuha might also be acting strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mentally preparing himself, Keiki peeked over at his little sister. When he did, he spotted her sitting at a table reading a cooking magazine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So Mizuha is the same as always…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl showed no signs of acting differently. She was wearing her school uniform properly like always. Her necktie was neither crooked nor loose. She flashed him an angelic, cute smile. Thinking that everything was a-okay, he was about to pull away his gaze when-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Keiki felt a vague feeling of discomfort plaguing him. Something about Mizuha was different from usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see…</p>
<p class="null-p">He pondered it for a moment and finally realized what was causing his discomfort.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha hasn't flashed her panties even once today…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Mizuha was an exhibitionist. She was the kind of person who would get excited by showing skin to the opposite sex, showing the valley of her cleavage, or even flashing her panties once in a while in an attempt to seduce her older brother. Yet she hadn't done anything of the like today.</p>
<p class="null-p">For her, not doing anything is weird in and of itself…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, are you feeling okay?" "Hmm? Why do you ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you usually would have flashed your panties two or three times by now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about? I wouldn't flash my panties like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not such a perverted girl as to show my panties to my older brother." "Who are you again?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't believe that this was the same person who had 'no-panties' days, i.e. days when she would walk to school without wearing panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, she would have shown him her underwear at least a few times…</p>
<p class="null-p">What exactly is going on here?</p>
<p class="null-p">Not just Yuika and the others, but now Mizuha was acting odd. It almost felt like Keiki's 'De-Perversion' had worked, but he hadn't done anything to them in the first place. Even if he asked them about it directly, they would act like everything was the same as usual. The mystery about it all only grew more confusing.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone is acting weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day during lunch break. While eating lunch with Shouma in their classroom for the first time in quite a while, Keiki asked for advice while he finished unwrapping his lunch box.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Weird in what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan isn't treating me like a slave." "Isn't that something to be happy about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not just that. Sayuki isn't treating me like a potential master, either. Nanjou isn't reading her usual BL manga, and Mizuha didn't flash her panties at me even once."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again, isn't that something to be happy about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but something stops me from feeling happy about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's true that this change might have been a bit abrupt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All of them changed at the exact same time without any warning."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was taking her calligraphy seriously and wasn't making dirty jokes, Yuika was drawing completely normal picture books with no sadistic undertones, Mao was reading normal shoujo manga, and even Mizuha wasn't showing any exhibitionistic tendencies. Overnight, the four girls had turned into perfectly normal high school students. In a certain sense, this was the development he had been waiting for, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that these perverts have put their perverted past behind them. There has to be something going on behind the scenes."</p>
<p class="null-p">There is no way that these perverts would suddenly start acting normal. This was most likely just the calm before the storm. Somewhere unknown to Keiki, the perverts must be hatching some weird plan again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Christmas is right around the corner, so maybe they're just planning a surprise party?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would they have to act different, though?" "That's true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Logic and rational thinking don't work with these club members. I've been locked inside the club room with Yuika, I've had Sayuki-senpai wake me up naked while sleeping in the same bed… In a certain sense I'm used to it, but I still have to be careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure are spending your youth doing interesting things, Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">A youth that involved far too much contact with perverts. Something was definitely wrong with this romcom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do think there has to be a reason why they're all acting like functional human beings now, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since this happened at the same time for all four of them, there might be</p>
<p class="null-p">something that connects it all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. The problem is that I don't know what their goal might be."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why would they all feign innocence now? They were all acting like they had never had a fetish in the first place. The crux of it all was hidden somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even when I asked them about it, they acted like nothing was wrong." "Well, it makes sense that they wouldn't tell you their plans."</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any spy who could explain their strategy to Keiki. Wringing their goal out of them would prove difficult. If so, then-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe stimulating them a bit could help."</p>
<p class="null-p">If one method didn't work, go for next. Keiki took out his smartphone and wrote an email.</p>
<p class="null-p">'What are you guys planning?'</p>
<p class="null-p">After he sent the email, Mao realized that she had been contacted. After checking her phone, she looked over at Keiki. She looked back at her smartphone and punched out an email of her own at lighting speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">'What are you on about?'</p>
<p class="null-p">She showed no signs of revealing anything. "I thought so. She's playing dumb."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we expected as much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Shouma, could you help me out for a second?" "I don't mind. What do you want me to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't answer the question. Instead, he just grinned. There was one simple method to win against Mao. However, the only problem with it was</p>
<p class="null-p">that he required Shouma's assistance. After they finished their preparations, Keiki sent Mao another email.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Look over here for a sec.'</p>
<p class="null-p">When she saw this, Mao glanced over at Keiki with a fed-up expression, only for her eyes to open wide a moment later. A shocked 'Wha?!' leaked out of her mouth. And who could blame her? When she turned around, she was greeted by the sight of Keiki and Shouma leaning their shoulders against each other, smiling and laughing happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, how about this? For any normal person, it might just look like we're good buddies, but-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For a fujoshi like Mao-chan, there's no way she would miss something like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the first stage of their operation was cleared. With his shoulder still against Shouma's, Keiki sent another email.</p>
<p class="null-p">'If you tell me your plans, I wouldn't mind giving you even more BL material.'</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a devilish temptation. For a BL content creator like Mao, this was a trade she normally couldn't pass by. After reading the email, Mao was lost in thought for a second, only to reply…</p>
<p class="null-p">'I don't have any interest in BL, okay?!'</p>
<p class="null-p">To think she would really decline this tasty offer. In addition, as if to show that her resolve was firm, she directed her gaze back to the book in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch, she put her guard back up already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it seems like she really is hiding something." "Yeah, how intriguing."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no doubt that Mao and the other girls were up to something. If it</p>
<p class="null-p">was going to prove impossible to get any more information out of Mao, he would have to ask someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Luckily, I still have three other targets to choose from."</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes ended for the day, Keiki headed straight to the calligraphy clubroom. When he opened the door to head inside, he immediately spotted Yuika close by, about to turn on the switch for the A/C.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Welcome, Keiki-senpai." "Is it just you, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, the others will probably take a bit longer." "Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, it was just the two of them inside the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't waste this opportunity to get information out of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He immediately went on the offensive. "Listen, Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be a bit sudden, but would you mind if I rubbed your small breasts right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, all expression vanished from the girl's face. Maybe because of the landmine 'small breasts', or maybe because of the sexual harassment, or maybe even both. Normally, this would be the point in time when Yuika would turn into the sadistic queen she could be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…" Yuika said with a freezing cold tone of voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was certain that a harsh punishment would follow. Shivers ran down his spine as his body shook in fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right! That's it, Yuika-chan! Insult me like you always do!</p>
<p class="null-p">If she turned into the pervert she had always been, it would be Keiki's win. He could use the opportunity to get information out of her. However, Yuika's reaction betrayed Keiki's hopes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, what are you saying in front of a girl? Keiki-senpai, you lecher~" "What did you say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She just returned a kind smile and spoke calmly. Even though he used the forbidden words 'small breasts', the girl hadn't shown an angry reaction. Her cheeks were only slightly red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can ask those sorts of things if we're in a more intimate relationship, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Says the girl who stuffed her panties into my mouth…" "My, whatever might you be talking about?" Yuika sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was acting like a kindergarten teacher scolding small kid for pulling a prank.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't eat panties. You wear them, you know?" "I know that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He of all people didn't need to be told that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu. Yuika is a normal girl, so she wouldn't want a boy to eat her panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, even a lunatic wouldn't do something like that…Yuika-chan, just what are you girls planning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We aren't planning anything? Yuika has always been like this." "Stare-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki met her with an intense stare, Yuika was forced to avert her eyes. However, Keiki could still hear her muttering to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu… he still doesn't believe Yuika… But she can't let it end here… She has to act like a normal girl until Christmas…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Christmas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! Um…" Yuika grew flustered. "…Yuika is going for a flower shower!" "Eh? …Ah, Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She ran away. Only a bit more prodding and he might have been able to get some valuable information out of her, but Yuika escaped to the toilet.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the final word he heard from her piqued Keiki's interest. "Until Christmas… What exactly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was Christmas in some way related to Yuika acting weird? Though Keiki had to assume that they were in some way related, he had no way to make sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it's just Nii-san today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mizuha. Yeah, Yuika-chan was just here, but she left suddenly." "I see," Mizuha put her bag on the chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika had run away just a moment ago, and Mao and Sayuki weren't here yet. This was yet another chance for Keiki to gather information, as he decided to act before she could sit down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you flip your skirt?" "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you flip up your skirt so I can see your panties?" "I heard you the first time. My panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, your panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh… B-But…" Mizuha pushed down her skirt, fidgeting. "What's wrong? Normally you'd be happy to show me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I mean… it's embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, his stepsister, who had been a hardcore exhibitionist only a few days ago, was now acting like a normal girl. From the looks of it, she wouldn't be showing him out of her own accord.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll have to do it my way." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't want me to flip your skirt, tell me what everyone is planning." "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's voice shook as she was presented with two terrible choices.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know the reason, but apparently Mizuha and the others are acting like they aren't perverts…</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a battle of the wits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey now. If you don't hurry and tell me, I'll flip it up with both my hands, you know~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeek?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While moving his hands and fingers in a grotesque way, Keiki approached his little sister. Normally she'd say something inviting, like 'Nii-san doing it actually makes me more excited', so what kind of reaction would Mizuha have now?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sniff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki looked up to see his little sister's expression, he had tears in her eyes. She pushed down her skirt with a beet red face, averted her gaze with a sulk, and pouted. Following that-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, you idiot."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The worst thing you could tell a siscon like Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, but… Whaaaaaat?" Keiki was bewildered by this reaction once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he had made her cry, he completely abandoned his information- gathering. Instead, plagued by intense guilt, Keiki apologized immediately and profusely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't get it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, Keiki stood in a hallway intersection on the second floor, gazing down at the courtyard. Staying in the same room with Mizuha was too awkward, so he had told her he was going to the toilet, and after he left, he instead walked around the school aimlessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, what is going on here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way an exhibitionist would start crying just from someone threatening to flip her skirt. That had to have been acting, but even if they were fake tears, it still caused way too much mental damage for a siscon like Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I knew it was acting, but I still couldn't torture her any more…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki cursed his little sister's good acting skills. She might even be able to be an actress in the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, my embarrassed little sister can't be this cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching a girl being seen in a way she doesn't want to be is the cute part. Her openly showing her panties wasn't cute at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But in the end I didn't get any information out of Mizuha, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was the type of girl who had tight lips. She wouldn't reveal a secret that easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My. If it isn't Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki turned around when he heard a familiar voice, and he saw Sayuki standing a little ways away from him. As she approached him, she called out to him in a puzzled tone of voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing out here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just thinking about some stuff. More importantly, there's something I want to ask you, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided to stop the underhanded tactics and just ask directly. "What are you girls hiding?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What might you be referring to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't try to play dumb. You're all acting like normal girls now." "We're not acting. The normal me is the real me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did he mishear? Unbelievable words were coming from Sayuki's mouth. "Normal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good joke," Keiki snorted, "Sayuki-senpai is the exact opposite of a normal girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cruel?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The cruel part was her trying to act like a normal girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Talking about deflowering, saying that your butt is your weakness, making dirty jokes left and right. And now you're acting like a normal girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I don't recall ever saying such things." "And you're stuttering as you say that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…" The upperclassman was unable to reply. Instead, she decided to glare at her Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fine. I'll tell you, now that I see how desperate you are." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wondering if I really am a normal girl right now. Well then, feast your eyes upon this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying these words, the girl liberated herself. Inside the hallway, a place where you never knew when someone could pass you by, Sayuki put both her hands on her skirt. Without hesitating in the slightest, she completely revealed her underwear hidden beneath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?! What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, you can see it…?! Keiki-kun is looking at my panties…!!!" "You were showing me, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, have a close look!" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The color of my panties today-is white!" "What about it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was absolutely lost. He couldn't deny the fact that Sayuki was wearing pure white panties, completely different from her normal, coquettish-looking designs. But what was she trying to say?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, you like the pure and normal type of girl, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm wearing white panties, so aren't I the purest of the pure?" "Your meaning of pure is greatly different from mine, Senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In what kind of world would showing your panties make you a pure girl? On the contrary, she was a textbook example of a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the following day, after classes came to an end. After finishing his cleaning duty for the day, Keiki once again headed over to the calligraphy clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, nobody told me what they were planning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The four of them stayed strong, feigning innocence. That being said, it wasn't like he was completely without a lead. What Yuika and Sayuki said stuck with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something about pure, normal girls and Christmas…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Christmas was one of the biggest events of the year. In that sense, the girls were clearly plotting something in regards to that, but Keiki was powerless without any intel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, I guess they're going to act clueless again today."</p>
<p class="null-p">Talking with a pervert who was acting like a normal girl was actually quite nerve-wracking for Keiki. That being said, what would happen if he were to run away? While pondering this living hell, Keiki had no other choice but to</p>
<p class="null-p">head to the clubroom anyway. "…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was about to open the door like he always would, but he heard voices coming from inside, so Keiki stopped. He barely cracked the door open and listened to what they were saying inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Keiki-kun is way more on guard than I expected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-He's quite the formidable enemy for not falling for Yuika's pure girl act." "-Well, Kiryuu is a virgin, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-That's Nii-san for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">He heard the voices of Sayuki, Yuika, Mao, and Mizuha distinctly. "…What are they talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the topic of the conversation was Keiki himself, but he only heard bits and pieces of it, which didn't give him enough information. He took a peek inside the room and spotted the four girls sitting around a table, almost like they were holding a meeting of sorts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I still won't give up just yet. I'll definitely make Keiki-kun mine by Christmas."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's Yuika's line. She won't hand over Keiki-senpai like that." "I need Kiryuu to become my model for my Fuyucomi manuscript." "I want to go on a Christmas date with Nii-san as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard that, Keiki narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Christmas date…?</p>
<p class="null-p">On Christmas, and especially on Christmas Eve, a lot of couples tended to go</p>
<p class="null-p">on dates. But why would that be the topic of the conversation now?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, sucks to be you. Keiki-kun is going to fall head over heels for how pure and normal I am. We'll go on a date, and after that we'll go to a hotel where we'll spend a passionate date as master and pet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't go spitting nonsense, Witch-senpai! Keiki-senpai is Yuika's slave, so naturally his master will be the one who takes his first time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I need the best kind of material for my manuscript! I need to see Kiryuu in the nude so that I can make the best possible 'Christmas Arc' for my shortcake series!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to do a strip show in front of Nii-san and have him ravish me all night long!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls started arguing, and Keiki had to listen to this mess. "What is going on here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Had there ever been a conversation scarier? They were treating Keiki like an object to play around with during Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, we have to be thankful to them for giving us such valuable information."</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh? What kind of information? And who are they talking about?</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone else is involved in this odd situation?</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right," Yuika agreed, "Now that we know Keiki-senpai is looking for a pure girl he can go on a Christmas date with, we can use it to our advantage."</p>
<p class="null-p">What did she just say?!</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the first Keiki had heard of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm looking for someone to go on a Christmas date with? A normal, pure</p>
<p class="null-p">girl?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter who he chooses, the rest of us won't hold any grudges, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds just fine. Yuika will make Keiki-senpai fall head over heels for her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about this, but I plan to make Kiryuu my nude model." "I don't plan on handing Nii-san over to you all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, they had already decided everything. Sayuki made a final statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inviting him ourselves would be against the rules, so we'll have Keiki-kun invite us first. It seems like I will have to lock away my masochistic slave tendencies for a bit longer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You aren't locking anything away, Witch-senpai." "Liking a normal, pure girl? Kiryuu sure is a total virgin." "Pure girls are an urban legend, after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">An urban legend… Though the way she put it sounded awful, Keiki finally understood the girls' aim.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that's what was going on…</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Keiki suspected, the girls hadn't been rehabilitated at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">They are all targeting me…</p>
<p class="null-p">As it turned out, they were all plotting in the shadows. The perverts were all feigning innocence in order to gain the right to go on a date with Keiki on the day couples are always at their boldest.</p>
<p class="null-p">But now that I know what they're planning, I won't fall for it that easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had decided to give his precious virginity to his future lover. There wouldn't be any S&M play during the holy night, and neither did he plan to become a nude model. He could do without a strip show, too. Basically, if he went on a date with a girl from the calligraphy club, he would graduate from his virginity. That would mean that there could only be one way of dealing with this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until Christmas ends, I have to escape from the rotten hands of these perverts!</p>
<p class="null-p">He would continue to ignore the girl's approaches, and would spend Christmas alone. Though it was the only option left for him to take, it still required the world's saddest level of determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he had found out their plan, Keiki went home without showing his face at the club. He sent Sayuki an email saying he wanted to read the newest issue of a manga he liked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But who leaked that fake plan of mine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was searching for a normal, pure girl to spend a Christmas date with. There apparently was someone who was feeding Sayuki this false information. With this fact in mind, Keiki thought back to the incident a few days back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san did ask me what type of girl that I like…" Keiki had said that he liked a normal, pure girl the most.</p>
<p class="null-p">So Onizuka-san is the one who told them? But what would she gain from doing this?</p>
<p class="null-p">How would Megumi benefit from riling up the calligraphy club girls? And why would she go out of her way to add the Christmas date part?</p>
<p class="null-p">Would the perpetrator gain something if a Christmas date was on the line?</p>
<p class="null-p">It most likely wasn't Megumi. But then, who?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki walked down the hallway while thinking about who the mastermind could be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ahh, Keiki-kun!" A cheerful voice called out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone tapped on his shoulder. When Keiki turned around, he saw a beauty with a smile that bloomed like a flower holding one hand in the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heyho~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello there, Takasaki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the former student council president Takasaki Shiho, who was flashing a cheerful smile as she always did.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How's it looking recently? Are you doing fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not too bad. How about you, Senpai? How did your entrance exams go?" "Not too bad as well. I took the exam and had an interview."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that the student council election is over, it feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks. Well, I still check in on them from time to time," She laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's probably helping Ayano a bit, since Ayano isn't quite used to the work yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about you, Keiki-kun? Anything interesting going on?" "Well, a lot happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are the calligraphy club girls passionately attacking you, by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho managed to hit the bulls eye just like that. She continued with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are popular, Keiki-kun. So many girls want to go on a Christmas date with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How do you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I was the one who stirred them up, after all." "The perpetrator revealed herself?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were talking with Megumi-chan near that vending machine, right?" "You saw us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I happened to spot you by pure coincidence, and thought I might as well listen in for a bit. I heard you say that you like normal girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">So it really was that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So… I simply told the club president 'Keiki-kun is apparently looking for a normal, proper girl to take out on a Christmas date,' you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you do something like that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the reason Sayuki and the others had gone crazy. She was the source of this awful false information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, it's Christmas soon, right? If I stir up the girls to go on dates with you, I can enjoy my own Christmas with NTR fantasies."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh lord…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be recharging myself with fantasies of Keiki-kun being NTR'd from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He sort-of understood what she was saying, but he really wished he didn't. "Thanks to that, the perverts are all targeting me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I figured as much. These girls are really great. They're living up to my expectations."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the worst!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho knew about Sayuki and Yuika's sexual tendencies. Back when Keiki had been attacked by the two girls in the nurse's office, she had been hiding in the locker, 'recharging herself' as she watched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, Keiki-kun going on a date with another girl, then going to a hotel… just imagining what you'll do there makes my body shiver…!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah?! Wait, wouldn't it be better if everybody joined in on the bed?! Four girls on Keiki at the same time makes my NTR senses tingle four times the amount as well!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person ain't stopping with her fantasies!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho was going full throttle. Maybe the thought of Christmas caused every pervert to go crazy. But Shiho really was a different kind of pervert. She was fantasizing about NTR in broad daylight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The girls from the calligraphy club are coming over here?" "What'd you say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki spun around and spotted the figures of people walking down the</p>
<p class="null-p">hallway. It was Yuika and Sayuki. "Keiki-senpai spotted!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. This time I'll show you how pure my bra is as well!" Again, that is the exact opposite of pure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm looking forward to Christmas!" Shiho smiled at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This might be the most exciting Christmas ever! In a bad way!" Keiki cursed as he started to run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was running from the self-proclaimed 'pure girls', Keiki once again ran the current situation through his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be Keiki's win if he managed to protect his virginity until the end of Christmas. He would run away from the perverted girls until the night of the 24th came to an end. Once that happened, he would be victorious. To achieve this, he could not make any date plans with anybody from the calligraphy club. Or even better, he could make other plans.</p>
<p class="null-p">If only I had another girl to go on a date with during that time…</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, the perverts would probably give up as well. Then again, there was no way anybody like that would appear out of the blue.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Right before Christmas, on the 22nd of December.</p>
<p class="null-p">The end-of-term ceremony came to an end, and Keiki was busy helping his kouhai Airi in the student council office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to have you help me out on the final day like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'm used to this work from my time as the secretary here." December heralded the end of the year, and it was always a busy month. That</p>
<p class="null-p">wasn't an exception for the student council, which led to Keiki receiving an email asking for assistance from the student council treasurer. Since there were a lot of expenses from the election and such, there was a lot to work out and organize.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano was out for a meeting with the various committee presidents. Megumi, Rinko, and Shiho were all out as well, so Airi had been left behind with the rest of the work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright, that's done!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Many hands made for light work. It took around an hour, but Airi and Keiki reached a good stopping point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much. I'll go make some tea, so wait a moment." "Gladly."</p>
<p class="null-p">The room was more tidy than it had been a while ago, and the data was safely entered into the PC. Keiki was enjoying a soothing cup of tea when Airi spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess the year is almost over." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai, do you have any plans for Christmas?" "Not as or right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not going on a date with someone from the calligraphy club?" "Haha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what is that dry laugh about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They are only interested in my body, nothing more…" "What is going on in that club…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't give any details, but if I go on a date with someone from the calligraphy club during Christmas, my life will be over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds tough," She said, but made it sound like she didn't care all too much. "Basically, you're running away from the members of the calligraphy club, Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At least call it a tactical retreat…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was trying to protect his virginity, but Airi made it sound like he had no spine at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So, would it be fine if the girl wasn't part of the calligraphy club?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm talking about Christmas. If you were invited by a girl outside of the calligraphy club, would you go on a date with them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I guess…? It'd help me have an excuse if I had someone else to go on a date with. It would also save me from spending the time alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't a bad idea by any means. The problem was that Keiki didn't have anybody convenient like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about we go on a date?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have any plans yet, and wouldn't all of your problems be taken care of if we did that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A date with… Nagase-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Nagase said that, Keiki found himself satisfied. Nagase Airi's secret fetish was yuri and all that yuri entailed. She wasn't into hardcore stuff like the sadistic Yuika, nor the masochistic Sayuki, nor the BL-material-seeking Mao. No harm should befall Keiki if he went on a date with her. Naturally, he would also not have to worry if his date was actually wearing panties or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be a big help… but is that okay with you?" "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, don't you hate men, Nagase-san?" "Ahh, there's no problem with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl dismissed Keiki's concerns. "After all, I like Kiryuu-senpai quite a bit." "Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not in a romantic sense, of course." "Figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did you get the wrong idea there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I did."</p>
<p class="null-p">He would have preferred it if she didn't tease him about it. The fact that the word 'Like' came out of Airi's mouth just had taken Keiki by surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what will you do? It's all up to you, Senpai," Airi asked Keiki once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the sounds of it, she wasn't joking. "Please! Go on a date with me this Christmas!"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, it was the morning of the Christmas date, the 24th of December. Keiki left the house with a bit of a puffy jacket on and made his way to the location they had decided to meet at. He had put more work than usual into his outfit today. He was wearing slacks with a turtleneck and a thin coat on top. He even went so far as to copy an outfit he had seen in a fashion magazine,</p>
<p class="null-p">which was probably better than anything he could have come up with. "The other person is Nagase-san after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">She would probably be strict about his appearance, so he had to be careful. "Still, I would have never imagined going on a date with Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Back when he first met her, she thought Keiki was a pure-blooded playboy, and now they'd gotten relatively close. After he got back her panties from the cat during the sports festival, after he tried to cure her hate for men by playing cards in swimming trunks… When he remembered all the things that had happened, he found himself smiling naturally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Oh, there she is."</p>
<p class="null-p">About ten minutes before the actual meetup time, Keiki spotted a single girl standing beneath a monument with a clock on it in front of the strain station. But before he could call out to her, she noticed him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-senpai!" "Eh? Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing there wasn't the promised Nagase Airi, but rather his other Kouhai, Koga Yuika. She was wearing a knitted one-piece and matching black tights with a white denim jacket on top. A bag with a cute design was over her shoulder, and it looked like she had put a lot of effort into her hairstyle. She greeted Keiki with an angelic smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you here, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because she will be going on a date with you." "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika is going to be his date partner? Openly confused at the situation, Keiki felt his smartphone inside his pocket vibrating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An email…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It came from Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Escort Yuika properly today, okay? Fight~'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It finally clicked for Keiki. That Kouhai never had any plans of going on a date with Keiki. Her true aim was to lure Keiki out here. He had forgotten, but Airi was actually a partner in crime in Yuika's 'Keiki Enslaving Plan'. However, by the time he realized that he had been deceived, it was already too late.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: Yuika-chan wants to go on a date!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san! What is going on here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After encountering Yuika at their meet-up location, Keiki swiftly retreated to a nearby toilet in order to question Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now. Calm down, Kiruyu-senpai," Airi said in a lecturing tone, "This is my Christmas present to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your Christmas present?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I gave the girlfriend-less Kiryuu-senpai a wonderful date with a beautiful woman as a present!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, are you not entertained? Shouldn't you be happy about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You changed my date partner on the day of! That's cheap fraud, nothing more."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt like he had opened a present expecting to find a new game only to find clothes instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…And here I thought I would go on a date with Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Were you looking forward to your date with me, by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">An awkward silence filled the conversation. Airi spoke up as if she was trying to alleviate the awkwardness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, oh well! Today you'll just have to escort Yuika around!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think Yuika will do anything weird like you're expecting her to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll just have to wait and see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's words clearly implied something, but she gave no more information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's true that Yuika has been looking forward to this date. She came to ask me for advice so that she wouldn't lose against the other Senpais, you know. She wanted to spend this time with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan did?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koga Yuika's goal was to make Keiki her slave. But he found his heart skipping a beat often because of her. Girls truly were unfair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika sure is cute, isn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…When she's not trying to make me her slave, that is."</p>
<p class="null-p">He tried to act calm, but Airi knew that he must have been flustered. She gave a light snicker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take care of Yuika, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't exactly just go home now that his cute Kouhai had asked him that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but don't assault Yuika, or I won't forgive you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's more likely that I'll be the one assaulted."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki was a virgin. He definitely didn't have enough courage to take a girl straight to a hotel just like that. He was more afraid that Yuika would tie him up and take him there herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation between Airi ended there, and checked himself one last time in the bathroom mirror.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan put a lot of effort into her appearance today."</p>
<p class="null-p">She always looked really charming, but after she put even more effort into her appearance, she looked cuter than ever. Whatever her goal may be, Keiki felt happy that she had gone out of her way to such a degree for him. Men really were simple beings.</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the bathroom, Keiki made his way back to Yuika. "Thanks for waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome back. Did you finish talking with Airi?" "So you knew, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Are you angry that Yuika is here instead of Airi?" "I'm not angry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? …If you really don't like it, we can just stop…" Yuika looked up at Keiki with concern.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki just calmly reached his hand out and gently patted her on the head. "We're here already, so we might as well go through with the date. You</p>
<p class="null-p">really dolled yourself up, so it'd be a waste not to go out, right?" "Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I have one condition." "What is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For the entire day, anything perverted will be forbidden! Act normal, with no rotten S&M roleplay at the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, so you found out about our plans." "I mean, it was really obvious."</p>
<p class="null-p">The four perverts had suddenly turned into pure girls. Anyone rational would have had their doubts. Though he hadn't expected Shiho to be the mastermind, but that wasn't really relevant anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Yuika will take a break from that for today." "What, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika was planning on doing so from the beginning." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Yuika-chan had sealed away her sadism for the day. If she kept her word, then Keiki might even be able to enjoy the date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then should we go?" "Yes. For starters…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning towards Keiki, Yuika stretched out her hand. "Can we hold hands, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you saying that just to keep me from running away?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Didn't we just agree that Yuika wouldn't do any of that today?" "Ah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had said this unconsciously. Apparently he was just constantly on guard against perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're just holding hands." "Ah, alright…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took Yuika's hand. There was a fresh, unfamiliar feeling to it. "Ehehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika laughed bashfully, and Keiki himself grew a bit flustered at the sight of how cute she was.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">…Oh? When you take out the S&M stuff, isn't this just like a normal date?</p>
<p class="null-p">Meeting up with a girl on Christmas Eve, walking through the town. This was as normal as a date could be.</p>
<p class="null-p">No no no, I can't let down my guard just yet. She might just be waiting for the moment when I relax, and then devour me whole.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been betrayed countless times so far because of his naivety. He would have to be careful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm not that easy of a man, all right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you acting like a tsundere now? Let's go, Senpai." "O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pulling Keiki's hand, the girl headed towards the train station. Thus, Keiki's Christmas date with Koga Yuika began.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">When they stepped off the train and made their way outside the station, the town in front of them was filled with Christmas colors. No matter where they looked, everything was sparkling, Christmas songs were playing in the background, and countless people in Santa Claus costumes were standing in front of the stores, selling special cakes. The people walking along the streets were all enjoying themselves as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are a lot of couples around, huh?" "Well, it is Christmas Eve."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally all kinds of couples would use this day to go on dates in town. It's a once-in-a year event, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma and Koharu-senpai… and even Onizuka-san and Inui-senpai must be</p>
<p class="null-p">out on their own dates as well right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi's self-imposed two-week no-dating ban had long passed. She and Naoya had now became an official couple, and they were probably enjoying their first Christmas Eve together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki gazed over at Yuika. Though they weren't holding hands right now, Yuika remained in a good mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's been a while since we went on a date. Right, Keiki-senpai?" "Now that you mention it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His last date with Yuika was back in May. Right before he found out about her fetish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what are we going to do today?" "Maybe a movie, or some karaoke?" "No objections from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika loved books, and she also loved movies. She rarely went out to watch them, though, so a change of pace might not be bad. However, Keiki had forgotten one important detail. That today was Christmas Eve-</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">30 minutes later, the two of them were just standing in the middle of the city, spacing out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's Christmas Eve for you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both the cinema and karaoke were jam-packed full…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, the 24th of December was a prime day for couples to go out. It was a day when almost every couple went out for a date. Not to mention that today was also a holiday, so any sort of entertainment business was packed full of normies. It made sense that standard locations for a date were all packed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we could line up and wait?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then again, just standing in line all day would be a waste."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about this. The date fell into place rather abruptly, so I didn't have time to come up with a proper plan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't make yourself feel down like that. If Yuika is with Keiki-senpai, anywhere is fine, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh… r-really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Or so Yuika would say to get Senpai's heart beating." "Don't go teasing your Senpai, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki complained, but he felt his face grow hot. When Yuika saw this, she grinned in joy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I let down my guard… I didn't think that Yuika-chan's game would be this strong…</p>
<p class="null-p">But this was exactly how the girl acted before Keiki had discovered her fetish. She had been rather distant to Keiki in the very beginning, but once they grew closer she had opened up more. She would smile more frequently, making you happy yourself if you watched her. While Keiki was lost in his memories, the girl let out a cute 'Hoi!' and clung to his arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… Yuika-chan, what are you doing?" "Isn't it fine? Everyone else is doing this, too." "I mean, yeah, they're couples."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you… not like it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, it's embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of maiden are you? Shouldn't you be happy that a cute girl like Yuika is doing this for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since this was reality, Keiki couldn't figure out how to respond. It didn't feel bad at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika-chan sure is more assertive today…</p>
<p class="null-p">Her suddenly clinging to his arm was completely outside his range of expectations. That might just show how serious she was about winning Keiki over. The odds of this all being part of her slave-ification plan was rather high.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what are we going to do now?" Yuika asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… let's see, the amusement park nearby is probably no good either." "Yuika is bad with crowds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're more of the indoor type, aren't you, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Recently, she had been getting along better with the girls from the calligraphy club, and even Airi, but she was still better with books than with other people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can we just do some light window shopping then?" Yuika asked. "That doesn't sound bad. Let's do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">As time passed, the day grew colder. It would soon be too cold to stand around outside. Just when the two of them went to move to a nearby store-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Merry Christmas!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Two beauties in santa costumes called out to them. They had pocket tissues in one hand, baskets in the other. Judging from the time and place, Keiki figured that they must be working at a part-time job, but there was something about them that stood out even more-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-san and Yuuhi-san?" "Oh? Is that Kei-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence to run into ya here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had seen these two Santas before. Namely, they were the two sisters from the Akiyama household. The one calling Keiki 'Kei-kun' was the older sister with short hair, Asahi. The one calling him 'Kei-chan' was the younger sister with long hair, Yuuhi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you out on a part-time job?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. Couldn't catch myself a boyfriend for Christmas Eve, so I ended up working with Asahi-chan to somehow get through this sad time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was quite the sad reason to work on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't have any plans either. Shou-kun is out with Koharu-chan on a date. They didn't allow me to join them, either, ehe," Asahi said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't blame him."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking your family out on a date with your girlfriend? That'd just be pure torture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you out on a date as well, Kei-kun? You got a cute girl with you." "Ah, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi directed her gaze to Yuika, who in return gave a stiff greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehm, my name is Koga Yuika. Yuika is a first-year at the same school as Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice to meet you. I'm Akiyama Asahi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I haven't seen you since the day at the cafe, right?" "Ah, yes. Yuuhi-san, was it? Nice to see you again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the quick greeting was over, Asahi gave Yuika a close look. "Yuika-chan, are you half-Japanese?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is actually a quarter English." "Is that so? How cute~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thank you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, can I pat your head? Or hug you? Yuika-tan is so cute… hehehehe…" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Overwhelmed by Asahi's sudden change in attitude, Yuika hid behind Keiki like a small animal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-san, you're scaring Yuika-chan." "My, what a shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was the exact opposite of the energetic Asahi. "Santa-san will give you this as an apology."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…T-Thank you very much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika received pocket tissues from Asahi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-chan, you take some as well." "Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi also gave some to Keiki. These sorts of tissues were often handouts that different companies gave away, and they often had advertisements within.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An aquarium, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, you could take the bus from here to the aquarium, which was holding a Christmas event.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like they have a special dolphin show today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't seem to be crowded yet, either, so if you haven't decided where to go yet, how about you check it out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi and Yuuhi gave their spiel. "What should we do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thinks it sounds interesting." "Then let's go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure," Yuika returned a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the sisters behind, the two of them made their way towards their newly-found date destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">It took them around thirty minutes to get there by bus. Though it wasn't devoid of people by any means, it was much more comfortable to walk around compared to the amusement park or restaurants, especially for someone like Yuika who was bad with crowds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai! Look, sharks! They have sharks!" "You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's eyes sparkled as she watched the sharks soar through the water. There were other fish inside the tank, and Keiki watched them in bemusement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are the other fish not going to get eaten by the sharks?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apparently, if you feed the sharks enough, they don't have any interest in doing so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, you sure know a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is an active book reader, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">She really was a bookworm. Back when he first met her, about all she had done was read books.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, you were called the 'Angel of the Library Room' back when you started attending the school, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, people called Yuika that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was just the Senpai from the library committee, mostly." "That's the first Yuika has heard of this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also 'Blondie-chan'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just judging Yuika from her appearance."</p>
<p class="null-p">While they exchanged short words like this, they made their way through the aquarium. They watched the fish get fed or play with each other. Time passed quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty dark in here." "Are you getting cold?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is fine, thank you very much." Yuika smiled happily at Keiki's sympathetic words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike her devilish sadistic smile, this smile brimmed with cuteness.</p>
<p class="null-p">That exchange just now… sure was like we were lovers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly speaking, it felt really good. Going on a date at the aquarium with a Kouhai like her almost made it feel like they were normies. More than anything, he enjoyed spending time with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Look at this, Keiki-senpai! They even have penguins!" "Ahh, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika pointed at the corner of the reservoir. A black and white penguin waddled over to greet them. The reservoir had both water and a shoreline, and the penguins could swim in the water or relax on the shore, enjoying their penguin life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you know that penguins don't have teeth?" "Well, most birds don't, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're so cute. They're so agile in the water, but on the ground they waddle so helplessly that it makes Yuika want to pick them up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I understand." That really was cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of penguins, Nanjou has a penguin stuffed toy." "A stuffed toy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. A rather crude-looking one called Sergeant Penguin. We went to a game center before, and she apparently took a liking to it, so I got it for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">During her slump period, Keiki had gone to visit her house, and he spotted it there. Apparently she really treasured it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You're on a date with Yuika, so don't talk about other girls…" "O-Ohh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">What was that? It was so cute. It was like when she said she wanted to monopolize Keiki and make him her slave, but it was awfully adorable at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As punishment, I want you to take a selfie with Yuika in front of the penguins."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would have done that even without the punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took out his smartphone to take the picture. But before he could do anything, Yuika spotted something, and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? That one's wings are a different color."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki followed her gaze. In one corner of the reservoir, there was a single penguin standing in solitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. Weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">The penguin didn't look all that different from the others, but one wing was colored entirely white. The other penguins had grouped together, relaxing on the rocks or diving into the water, but he stood alone, looking awfully lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe that penguin is all alone…" Yuika watched this with a sad look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, another penguin approached this white one, only to be shooed away immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's acting almost like Yuika back when she first started attending the school…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika would always read books on her own. She didn't try to get closer to anybody, just passed time doing what she enjoyed the most. She probably saw a bit of herself in that penguin. The desire to not be approached definitely was similar to how Yuika was in the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that one from before is going up to it again."</p>
<p class="null-p">The penguin who had been driven away yet again approached the white penguin. Almost like it was brimming with confidence, the black penguin rubbed itself against the white one. This time around, the white penguin didn't drive it away. Maybe because it had given up, or maybe because it had just been embarrassed the first time. Yuika watched this scene with a relieved smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's good. Apparently it has friends as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure looks like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe they were family, or friends, or even a lover. The two penguins looked happy now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's how Keiki-senpai kept talking to Yuika before." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, nothing at all," Yuika covered her mouth and smiled. She took Keiki's hand and started walking again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now let's see what else they have!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, Keiki had no reason to turn her down. Their aquarium date had just begun.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki and Yuika enjoyed their time at the aquarium. They walked through the underwater tunnel, touched starfish and hermit crabs at the</p>
<p class="null-p">petting corner, and watched the dolphin show.</p>
<p class="null-p">They ate their lunch at a nearby food court, enjoying what seemed to be seafood curry. Then, while they were looking around the gift shop for souvenirs, someone called out to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, there he is! Kei-kun!" "Yuika-chan's with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, the two Santa girls came approaching them. For some reason, Asahi and Yuuhi looked awfully rushed and slightly panicked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened to you two?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We got a call from our client after that. They said we could stop handing out tissues, but they wanted us to help with the event."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What event?" "This."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuuhi handed Keiki a flyer. Written on there was 'Calling all Couples: Princess Carry Contest'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Calling all couples…" "…Princess carry contest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Yuika tilted their heads in confusion at the same time. "What exactly is this about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As you can see, this contest is for couples to show how lovey-dovey they are by doing a princess carry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi started explaining.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, the boyfriend is supposed to carry the girlfriend in a princess carry. The winner gets a gift card for the bookstore worth 3000 yen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"3000 yen, huh? That's pretty generous."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had to admit that this was quite an impressive prize.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, but we haven't gotten many participants… For now, we called Shou- kun and Koharu-chan here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"During their date…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And we were hoping that maybe you two could participate as well. How about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… I'm fine with it. What about you, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked to his side, Yuika's gaze was glued to the pamphlet. "Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wants this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I figured. You can buy a lot of books with 3000 yen."</p>
<p class="null-p">For a high school student, 3000 yen was quite a large amount for spending on books. For a book-lover like her, it had to have been a really sweet deal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know if we can win, but do you wanna try?" "Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, in order to win the bookstore voucher for his cute girlfriend, Keiki decided to participate in the Christmas event.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'll call you once the time comes, so stand by in the waiting room until then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Led by Asahi, Keiki and Yuika made their way to where they were told. They soon found the aforementioned waiting room. It was furnished like a company meeting room with a conference table and desk chairs. When they entered, the two of them found the other contenders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, if it isn't Keiki and Koga-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We keep running into each other in the weirdest places, don't we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting on the chairs in front of them were the neatly dressed-up Shouma, and the grown-up looking Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you're here, I take it that you're also participating, Keiki?" "Oh, right. Asahi-san said you'd be here as well, Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. We were on our date in town when she gave me a call and begged me to come here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just had to help her out. I remembered how hard it was to gather participants for the pool event back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were looking for participants with tears in your eyes, weren't you, Koharu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were talking about the time Keiki and the other members of the calligraphy club, as well as Mizuha, had gone to the pool. Back then, though, the prize had been rather disappointing. Koharu knew the frustration of not getting anybody to join an event, and she had the kindness of heart to step forward herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, are you on a date with Koga-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Asahi-san and Yuuhi-san told us about this aquarium."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And just so you know, we're planning on winning the book store voucher." After Keiki answered, Yuika gave the reason that they were participating.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she knew both of them, Yuika had no trouble talking. But then yet</p>
<p class="null-p">another couple arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello? Is this the waiting roo-Oh, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when she entered the room, her eyes opened wide at the sight of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it ain't Kiryuu-shi and Koga-chan. Not to mention Akiyama-shi and the rumoured Legal Loli-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence to run into you."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Onizuka Megumi and Inui Naoya, who had just started dating a few days back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you came here as well, Onizuka-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. When we were out near the train station, these Santa girls handed us tissues."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We thought we might as well check it out." "So the same as us," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the two of them had also been invited by the Akiyama sisters. Still, it was a weird coincidence for all of them to gather in a place like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you're here, I take it that you're participating in the event as well, Kiryuu-shi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Yuika-chan wanted the bookstore voucher."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh…?" Megumi raised one eyebrow. "Kiryuu-shi, did you start dating Koga-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I actually tried to go on a date with Nagase-san, but she switched places with Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? …Eh? What?" Megumi blinked a few times, clearly not following.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not giving her any time to process, Shouma called out to her. "Onizuka-san. Are you participating, too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Right, right. We're out on a Christmas date, so we might as well do something couple-like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, right?! Not to mention a princess carry! That sounds wonderful!" "Ohh, so you understand it, Ootori-paisen!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu and Megumi immediately got along. They started chit-chatting, and after some time passed, the Santa sisters came back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, everyone! It's time for the event, so we're moving to the stage." "Follow us, will ya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Led by Asahi and Yuuhi, the participants started walking towards the nearby stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">The stage for the event was outside the aquarium. It was quite a simple stage, not much more than a platform to stand on, but it was big enough for all of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a lot of people here." "Even guests with children."</p>
<p class="null-p">Beneath the winter sky, couples and families had gathered in front of the stage, all of them looking quite excited.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone! Thanks for gathering here! We'll be starting the special event, the princess carry contest, right now! The moderators will be I, Akiyama Asahi, and-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her younger sister, Akiyama Yuuhi! Stay with us until the end, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi and Yuuhi were given a round of applause. They had handed out tissues in this cold, and now they were standing on a stage. The part-time Santas must have it rough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's start out by introducing the participants! From the right of the stage, the Onizuka Megumi-san and Inui Naoya-kun couple! Both of them are childhood friends, and they started dating just a while ago!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Childhood friends becoming a couple is something wonderful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beside them, we have the Koga Yuika-san and Kiryuu Keiki-kun couple! The two of them are members of the same club at school, so they're as close as a real couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A Senpai Kouhai relationship is something great, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Finally, we have the Ootori Koharu-chan and Akiyama Shouma-kun couple! Shouma-kun is actually our younger brother!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan might look like a loli, but she's actually a third-year in high school, so don't call the police. Thank you for your understanding."</p>
<p class="null-p">Some of the audience members chuckled at Yuuhi's joke. The two of them made for excellent emcees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go ahead and explain the rules, okay? The boy will carry the girl like a princess, and the couple who can stay like that the longest will be the winner!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The winning pair will receive a bookstore voucher worth 3000 yen, so try your best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi and Yuuhi finished the explanation and signaled that the competition was about to start.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if our enemy is Kiryuu-kun, we're not going to hold back!" "Yuika will try her best to win the bookstore voucher!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nobody can win against me if I get serious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu, Yuika, and Megumi all voiced their determination. "We'll be the ones doing the most work, though…" "Luckily, they're rather small."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Shouma exchanged some light words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the indoor type, so I really don't have any confidence…" Naoya muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then could the boys please prepare!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Asahi's instructions, Keiki faced Yuika. "Then… if you would?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had touched her body countless times until now. They had held hands, crossed arms, and he even touched her breasts before onn accident. Even so, he couldn't help but feel nervous again. He carefully put his right hand in the girl's shoulder, his left hand on her waist, and lifted her up in one fluid motion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If you say that Yuika is heavy, she'll never forgive you, okay?" "I won't, I won't," Keiki grinned at this cute line.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he checked his right and left, he saw Shouma and Naoya taking similar positions with their partners.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now the princess carry contest is in full action! If you break down, you're out, so try hard not to let your princess fall! How about we get a few words from the contestants?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asashi-san was in high spirits. She had always been the cheerful, energetic</p>
<p class="null-p">type, so a job like this might be quite fit for her. "Shouma-kun is holding Koharu-chan so gallantly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, I have to live through tennis training every day," Shouma said with a confident smile. "Koharu-chan is really light, as well. I could carry her forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, if I can be carried by Shouma-kun like this, I wouldn't mind staying small for the rest of my life," Koharu snickered from inside Shouma's arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me, but my younger brother's girlfriend is way too cute?!" "This is some deadly cuteness…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sisters each said their own words of admiration. Additionally, the audience let out a roar of excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-chan and Koga-san look pretty good to me, as well." "Well, I got Yuika-chan, so I'm on the good end."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she wasn't quite as small as Koharu, Yuika was still rather small in stature. Naturally, she wasn't as light as a feather, but he would be able to maintain this position for a while. However, the Megumi and Naoya team-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… Heavy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?! I'm a girl, so of course I'm not heavy at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naoya's knees were shaking from the weight of his beloved childhood friend. After hearing this exchange, laughter came from the audience.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like at least one pair is having a tough fight." "Even if she's a girl, people are heavy to begin with~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two moderators were trying to lighten the mood, but Megumi was already in a state of panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nao-kun! You can do it! At this rate, they'll think I'm overweight!" "Sorry, Megumi-chan… But I'm the indoor type, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nao-kuuuuuun?!" Thus, Naoya broke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, Inui-kun collapsed! Are you okay?! …Ah, he got up again." "Sorry, Megumi-chan. Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm not going to talk to you for a while." "No way?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the sounds of it, Megumi was quite irritated that the princess carry hadn't lasted any longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, how long do you think that was?" "…T-Ten minutes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Megumi's response, the audience let out a roar. Keiki almost let go of his princess in the process, but he barely managed to hold on to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're flirting while bickering! I'm so jealous!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a shame, but please make your way off the stage now that you're out, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Yuuhi's instructions, Megumi and Naoya stepped off the stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that the Onizuka-san pair is out, it will be a one-on-one match between the Koga-san team and the Ootori-san team!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What an abrupt development."</p>
<p class="null-p">Five minutes after the beginning, Megumi and Naoya dropped out.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this might actually be pretty tough…</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, it wasn't because Yuika was heavy. It was more like her was small, but she was still a high school student. Since he hadn't done any extensive muscle training, Keiki had his human limits. When he took a peek at his right, he met eyes with Shouma, who gave him a confident smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're going to give up, you might as well do it early, don't you think?" "Nah, I can still keep going."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh. Not bad, Keiki." "Right back at you, Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two grinned at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But just this once, I can't afford to lose." "What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I win this, Koharu-chan said she'd kiss me on the cheek!" "I was wondering why you were so serious about this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been wondering why Shouma was trying so hard even though this event was basically interrupting his precious date, but it sounded like there had been negotiations going on behind the scenes. That being said, no matter how light Koharu might be, she should still weigh more than 30 kilograms. In other words, he was carrying the weight of three 10kg rice bags. Even for Shouma, who had a trained body, there had to be a limit. As if to prove it, sweat started to build up on his face, much like Keiki's as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Kei-kun, are you okay?!" "I…I'm fine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki was close to accidentally dropping Yuika. "Keiki-senpai, you can do it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… but, honestly speaking…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Around ten minutes had passed, and he felt his arms growing numb. It was only a matter of time now before defeat would occur. Seeing this, Yuika whispered a soft voice up at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you win, Yuika will give you a great reward, okay?" "A reward?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She will listen to one request of yours, whatever it may be." "What… did you say?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_10_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Whatever it may be? So, it could even be something slightly lewd, as long as it didn't cross the line? No no no, of course he wouldn't go as far as to commit sexual harassment. That was for a married couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe I can make her wear some costumes?</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a school swimsuit, or a nurse outfit? Maybe a Chinese dress? He already had photos of Yuika in a bunny girl and a mad saved on his phone, so maybe something more exotic would be better.That-might possibly be the best Christmas present ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Let's do thiiiiiiis!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Limitless power started surging up from every fiber of his being. When he pictured Yuika wearing cosplay, Keiki broke through his limits like a transformed superhero.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh?! Kei-kun has made a glorious comeback?! It looked like Yuika-chan was whispering something into his ear! Maybe she made him some kind of special promise?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Boys are really simple."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't even bother listening to what Asahi and Yuuhi were saying. His life revolved around continuing the princess carry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about this, Shouma, but I can't afford to lose that easily." "That's the Keiki I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to have his Kouhai cosplay. In order to receive a kiss from the Senpai he loved. Desires and wishes battled against the other, and the two went above and beyond what was humanly possible in this relatively simple princess carry contest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The goal is to go… EVEN FURTHER BEYOND!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having already passed their limits, Keiki and Shouma mustered up the last ounce of their strength and screamed towards the heavens above. And, at the end of the battle-</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry that we couldn't win in the end…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the bus as they made their way to the train station, Keiki apologized for their soul-crushing defeat. In the end, Shouma and Koharu had taken the win, leaving Keiki unable to give Yuika the bookstore voucher as a present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be. Yuika is happy that you worked your hardest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… And also, Yuika already got what she wanted."</p>
<p class="null-p">In her hands, she held a single picture. It was the participation prize. It showed the moment when she had been carried by Keiki like a princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fufu," Yuika gazed at the picture happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw this, Keiki felt glad that they participated in the event. "Ah, that reminds me, Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?" Yuika lifted up her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki proceeded to take out a small envelope from the pocket of his jacket. "Before I forget it, here's your Christmas present."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A Christmas present?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she opened the envelope, Yuika's eyes went wide. "This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a penguin keychain. Since Yuika had been observing the penguins with so much passion, he had secretly bought this for her at the souvenir store.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looked like you really liked the penguins, so…" "Thank you very much. Yuika will treasure it."</p>
<p class="null-p">From the looks of it, Yuika was really happy. She embraced the present with both her arms, flashing a gleeful smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but… Yuika didn't get you anything…" "It's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not. Not giving anything back would go against the pride of the Koga</p>
<p class="null-p">Family."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that big of a-" "Kiss."</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's words were interrupted by a sudden kiss on the cheek. "Fufu. This is Yuika's Christmas present for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…" "Did you like it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much," Keiki was so flustered that he gave an automatic reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no boy who wouldn't be happy after being kissed like this. "By the way, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we won, what kind of request would you have asked Yuika for?" "………No comment."</p>
<p class="null-p">He averted his eyes immediately, earning himself a slight snicker from Yuika. He felt glad that he had given her this present instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they arrived at the train station, they would ride the train home, and the date would come to an end. He felt slightly regretful about that fact, and that showed how much he enjoyed today's date. But at the same time, there was something that caught his attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika-chan didn't act sadistically at all today…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki did say that he wouldn't allow any S&M roleplay right at the start, and she kept her word. Now that her battle for a date with Keiki had come to an end, she had no reason to act innocent anymore. Yet she decided to seal away her sadistic self. Did she have a change of heart after all?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, there's the station." "Yeah, you're right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was thinking this, the bus arrived at its destination, disrupting Keiki's ability to figure out the meaning behind all of this.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, it's cold…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure cools down fast late in the day like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Yuika had returned to their hometown by train, and by the time they stepped out at the train station, it had already gotten dark. The air was freezing, and small white clouds appeared whenever they breathed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything in the vicinity of the station was still lit up with Christmas lights. There were illuminations wherever they looked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like they put a lot of effort into this place as well," Yuika commented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like cleaning all of this stuff up would be a pain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's enjoy this for as long as it lasts, okay?" Yuika sighed at Keiki's pessimism.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, she took a few pictures with her phone. "Let's head home. It's gotten dark already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, let's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them started walking towards the girl's home. They walked next to each other idly chatting. About the date today, the exams a while back, or just holiday plans in general. And as they approached Yuika's home-</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Beneath a street light, the girl suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…" She called his name with a quiet voice. With a worried gaze, she looked up at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could we… take a short detour?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He found himself unable to deny her request thanks to her dampened eyes, which were like the eyes of a puppy about to be left behind. Keiki nodded quietly, and the two of them started walking again. He didn't know the destination, and they took streets they wouldn't normally use. They made their way away from the residential district, and the number of people around them grew less.</p>
<p class="null-p">How far did they walk in the end? Eventually, they arrived at a pedestrian bridge near the school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Snow."</p>
<p class="null-p">From the pitch-black sky, small bubbles of white came raining down. Fragile, small snowflakes, which could break with but a single breath. It was the first white Christmas for many years.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beautiful." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them lined up next to each other, gazing down at the scenery from the pedestrian bridge. Even though it should have been a familiar sight, the snow made it look like something special, almost otherworldly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki-senpai?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, Yuika likes Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki couldn't grasp what Yuika was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, just to let you know, that wasn't a joke, and Yuika doesn't mean as a friend. Yuika likes you as a member of the opposite sex."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki could say anything, Yuika sealed off all avenues of mental escape. He had trouble processing what she had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you surprised?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought my heart was going to leap out of my chest…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai is dense, so you would probably never understand unless Yuika told you this straightforwardly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Was he really that dense? To be honest, the answer to that wasn't important at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean… why? Since when…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Around the time you reached out to Yuika in the library room. After that, Yuika just grew interested in you… and then it just came naturally?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, from the very beginning. However, Keiki was still skeptical. "Didn't you want me to become your slave?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's obvious. Yuika wanted you to become her slave because she likes you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said that, Keiki was at a loss for words. He would have never</p>
<p class="null-p">guessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika actually likes this current relationship very much, you know? Getting rejected every time she tries to win Keiki-senpai over as a slave… She started thinking that things didn't have to change, and that just staying with Senpai was more than enough." She spoke with a kind tone, dwelling on her memories. "The reason she didn't confess until now was because she was afraid of ruining this relationship she loved…" She continued to tell Keiki her feelings. "Even so, Yuika realized that she had to tell you so that she wouldn't regret anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regret what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi was telling Yuika this at our last sleepover. That Keiki-senpai might be taken by someone else if Yuika hesitates."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san did…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just imagining Keiki-senpai going out with someone else made Yuika tear up and feel a sharp pain in her chest…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if she were remembering this feeling, Yuika put one hand on her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't want Keiki-senpai to be taken by anybody else… Not Witch- senpai, nor Mao-senpai, nor Mizuha-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why she decided to not show her true self today. Because you don't like a sadistic girl like Yuika. You like a pure, cute girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His doubts had been cleared away. That was the reason she had gone the entire day without showing her sadistic side. In order to have her beloved Senpai look at her. Her Senpai who preferred normal love more than anything. She had planned to confess today from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this snowy weather, on top of the pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was Yuika able to be the type of cute girl you would like, Senpai?" After she asked Keiki this, she didn't even wait for his answer. "Because Yuika likes Keiki-senpai… if… if you were to choose her…" Her eyes shone with determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yuika wouldn't mind becoming a normal girl."</p>

<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">*This Afterword contains spoilers, so be warned.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you very much for buying the 10th installment of HenSuki. The series started in 2017, and now it's finally made it to the double digits. It's been three years since Yuika-chan has been on the cover. This is all thanks to the support of my dear readers. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Content-wise, the student council election arc has finally come to an end, and we've gotten ourselves a brand-new student council, Onizuka-san included.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it's a shame that Takasaki-senpai has retired, I still have plans for her to show up at the student council occasionally, so worry not.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the election arc had more of a serious tone, it was refreshing to soften up the atmosphere a bit in the later half of the volume. Also, Onizuka-san's new haircut is super cute. The second I put her in the story, I decided to make her cut her hair. Let me tell ya, I was laughing like a pervert after seeing the color illustrations of her. Naturally, I am a big fan of the 'Cutting hair after being rejected' trope.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, a bit more on the serious side of things. Along with the release of this 10th volume, the manga has made its way to the 5th volume, and the spin-off 'Abnormal Harem' has gotten a volume release as well, so for those of you who are interested, please check them out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Abnormal Harem has more of a daily-life vibe to it, whereas the manga itself is moving forward towards the absolute greatest terrible scene as well, so look forward to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, now that we've made it to the 10th volume in the main series, we've reached a great turning point. How will the girls and our protagonist</p>
<p class="null-p">react to the confession, and what changes will they go through? I would be delighted if you're excited for more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let us meet again in the 11th volume. Hanama Tomo.</p>
