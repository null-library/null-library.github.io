<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, I have something important I want to discuss with you," said Fujimoto Ayano with a serious expression. She was wearing the yukata that the inn provided.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were on the veranda of an inn that they were staying at on their school trip, beneath an unobstructed starry sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki, wearing a similar yukata, returned the question, Ayano nodded, bringing both her hands, which she had been hiding behind her back until now, forward. Just like the object Cinderella had added to the love letter, it was a pair of snow white panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will you… trade panties with Ayano-san?" "I won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">The words made their way out of his mouth as easily as breathing. The student council vice president Ayano was actually a smell fetishist. With everything that had happened so far, with all the situations he had to go through up until now, he had anticipated this sort of development. He knew all too well that she desperately wanted Keiki's underwear, and this kind of situation where a confession would normally follow always turned a completely different sort of confession. One distorted in various ways depending on the pervert present.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Ayano's response after that was outside his expectations. "Okay. I'll give up on your underwear, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? That sure doesn't sound like you, Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Usually, the girl would try a bit harder even after being turned down once, but this time, the way she immediately backed down awakened a sense of discomfort in Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Instead, I want Kiryuu-kun to wear my panties on his head." "Excuse me? What did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, you've been way too close to Airi and the student council president, so you need some punishment, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that more Yuika-chan's forte?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu-kun felt a shiver running down his spine at this sadistic behaviour, which was completely unbecoming for the student council vice president. He tried to run away from the place immediately, but he was unable to do so when Ayano flung her tender body at him, pushing him down to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Fujimoto-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun is already a ladies' man, so you just have to wear panties on your head and become Pervert Mask."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pervert Mask?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing panties on his head like a beanie would no doubt cause people to label him a pervert. If he became something like that, he'd rather not walk on this earth anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Still straddling his chest, Ayano put her fingers through the holes that you would normally put your legs through and gradually brought the "mask" closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She reached out both her hands that were holding the panties, and the instant the lower part covered Keiki's eyes, a frantic scream filled the inn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Nii-san? Nii-san, it's morning already." "Hnggh… Mmm… P-Please… no… panties…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of sleep-talk is that? You'll be late if you don't get up soon, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm… Mmm…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A soft voice spoke to him, and his shoulders were tenderly shaken. Keiki slowly opened his eyes, and his gaze met with his little sister, Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh… Mizuha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Running his still bleary gaze over his surroundings, he found himself in his own room. The clock near his pillow showed 7am, and a soft sunlight entered through the opened window devoid of curtains.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank God… It was all just a dream…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He often had dreams of Yuika trying to feed him her panties, but the fact that the perpetrator was Ayano this time around really caught him off-guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a heartfelt yawn, Keiki slowly raised his body, and Mizuha let out a faint snicker in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Nii-san. I see you're quite the sleepyhead today." "Morning, Mizuha. Well, I had a bad night… mare?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The latter part of his sentence turned into a question. The reason for that was the surreal scene in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A nurse…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, Mizuha had clothed her tender body in a nurse outfit. It was a costume with a pure white color and a short skirt, not to mention a cute nurse cap. Currently, his little sister was cosplaying inside his own room.</p>
<p class="null-p">It might sound like some kind of bad fanfiction, but even after rubbing his eyes, the scene didn't change. The strangest part of it all, though, was Keiki's calm reaction. He let out a nonplussed "I see" as he nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I'm still having a dream, huh?" "This isn't a dream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if a light-novel-like scenario like this would actually happen in reality!" "Ehhh? Nii-san seems to be running away from reality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then prove it." "Prove what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you pinch my cheek for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure?" Though a bit confused, Mizuha reached out to her older brother's cheek and softly pinched it. "So?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, that hurt."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she hadn't pinched him very hard, Keiki still felt real pain. As it stood, it didn't seem to be a dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why are you wearing this outfit, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted Nii-san to think about me and nothing else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you please not go full yandere on me first thing in the morning?" "That was just a joke. I wanted Nii-san to get horny."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Horny?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, his little sister really wanted to make him horny first thing right after he woke up. Ignoring the whole horny thing, though, seeing Mizuha in a nurse costume like that completely drove away any sleepiness from Keiki's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm surprised you even own something like that, to be honest." "Does it suit me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a foolish question. If there were a nurse as cute as this in the world, I'd probably break my own leg to get hospitalized."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. I made it just for Nii-san." "You made it yourself, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I'm not as good at it as Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, it was insanely high-quality for being the work of an amateur. Mizuha Kiryuu was good at cooking, was a bit of a clean freak, and had impressive sewing skills. She was truly a high-spec little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you ever feel sick, I can give you a suppository while wearing this~" "Can't you just let me drink medicine normally?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't have any memories of ever using a suppository aside from back when he was a little child, and was assisted by his mother in such instances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, aren't you a bit too happy right now?" "Maybe. It's the day of the school trip, after all." "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He glanced over towards his desk where a stuffed-full backpack was waiting to be picked up. He had finished all his preparations yesterday so that he wouldn't have to hurry this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We should hurry. Breakfast is ready, so go wash your face." "Understood. And you go change into your uniform as well." "Fine~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha seemed to have been satisfied by just showing him the costume, and she left his room with no further complaints. After seeing her off, Keiki directed his gaze towards the backpack again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The school trip, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A school trip could be considered one of the most fundamental events in a student's life. In their school, only second-years would be going on this trip, so his little sister Mizuha, his classmate Mao, and the student council vice president Ayano would all be participating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd be really nice if nothing weird happened…" Keiki muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki, who had gone through all kinds of weird mishaps during the past few months, couldn't imagine that everything would end well. Most likely, the aforementioned girls would cause some ruckus. A fujoshi, an exibitionist, and a smell fetishist. Considering that all of them would be on this trip, it would be far more unbelievable if something didn't happen. They would all surely be targeting Keiki in some sort of perverted way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't plan on just being toyed with all the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Truthfully, these perverted girls were nothing more than a complete pain. However, Keiki wasn't planning on just standing by while they did whatever they wanted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During this event, I'll definitely make some progress on my previously- suspended 'De-perversion' plan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As of recently, too many things had piled up, which had caused Keiki to not be able to make serious progress on his plan. Said plain revolved around the idea of turning all these perverts into socially functional, perfectly normal girls. The school trip was an excellent chance to achieve this end. He couldn't let this opportunity to spend a fulfilling and love-filled youth go to waste.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: Curry. After that, Panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">A bus full of students headed towards an inn nestled among the mountains. Keiki and Shouma were sitting far in the left corner of the bus, chatting idly just like all the casually-dressed classmates around them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're starting to drive by fewer and fewer buildings, huh?" "We might be getting close to our destination, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Around an hour had passed since the bus had departed from their school. Far from the familiarity of city sights, they were now surrounded by a green, fresh-looking rural area. They might have even entered the mountains already. Rows of trees were quickly flashing past their windows. Sometimes they passed small fields where farmers could be seen at work, raising their heads to gaze at the bus. Just as Shouma had said, they must be getting pretty close to their destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In a remote place for two nights and three days, far away from other civilization. It's not a bad time for it at all," Keiki muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For what?" Shouma asked</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I might not get a chance like this anytime soon, I was planning on making some progress with my 'De-perversion' plan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so you're still trying to do that, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma could hardly be blamed for forgetting about it. Keiki's goal was to finally find a girlfriend like he had always wanted and to spend a joyful and fulfilling youth with her. In order to do this, he had to turn these perverted</p>
<p class="null-p">girls, who would probably try to break him and his girlfriend up, into proper human beings. Those were the subjects of this 'De-perversion' project.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unfortunately, the project so far had made absolutely zero progress whatsoever. Ever since Keiki proudly declared the initiation of this plan, not a single girl had been cured.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I dreamed about Fujimoto-san last night." "What about her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lot happened. She was trying to force me to wear her panties on my head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's quite an abnormal development."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I almost turned into a Pervert Mask. The thing is, stuff like that might actually happen in real life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Common sense doesn't work very well against these kinds of perverts. Keiki was all too aware of that fact. His Kouhai had stuffed her freshly-worn panties into his mouth, almost asphyxiating him in the process. It wouldn't be weird if there was a girl who would force him to wear her panties on his head. It might sound like a bad joke, but for Keiki, it could very well turn into harsh reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first, I just thought I had to do something about everyone from the calligraphy club, but Fujimoto-san is part of the problem now, too. Even now, she's still trying to take my underwear…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Crossdressing Rintarou and yuri-loving Airi aside, the olfactophile Ayano might very well get in the way of Keiki's future love life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have my hands full with the calligraphy club, and now I have to deal with members of the student council as well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sounds like you have it pretty tough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just recently, Keiki had, much to his chagrin, found out that the student council president Takasaki Shiho had an NTR fetish. He had promised not to talk to Shouma or anyone else about it, but he was worried about what she might be planning in the near future. All told, the perverted girls had brought mountains full of problems with them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I give up, it'll be all over," Keiki said, voicing his conviction. "So do you have any sort of plan for your operation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, none at all." "Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I'm stuck at square one again. They're all well-trained perverts. I can't find any way to sneak behind their defenses and defeat them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sound like you're a soldier on a mission." "Pretty much. Anyway, do you have any ideas?" "Definitely not off the top of my head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I figured as much."</p>
<p class="null-p">After trying out all sorts of things, nothing had caused any lasting effect. He wouldn't have had this much trouble if straightforward solutions worked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fixing these perverts would most likely require some very clever, unorthodox methods. While thinking about that, Keiki remembered something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, Shouma. What's up with Yuuhi-san?" "Did something happen with Yuki-nee?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's not that big of a deal. I was just wondering if she's doing fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Well, I guess…? She's acting the same as always, getting on my nerves all the time. Asa-nee and her are still harassing me the same as ever, so I guess she's in good spirits. What about her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing. Nevermind, then." Keiki felt relieved upon hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank God. It seems like Yuuhi-san is doing okay.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been dumped around the same time as the culture festival, and had found someone else she had been interested in. Keiki played cupid and gave her advice. During that time, he found out that Yuuhi, who had always been bragging about her experience, was actually a virgin. In the end, the boy she liked seemed to already be pursuing another girl in his eyes, so Yuuhi ended up with a broken heart yet again. On his last phone call with him, she told him, "Sorry that it didn't work out after all you did," so Keiki naturally was worried about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems like Yuuhi-san has terrible taste in men.</p>
<p class="null-p">As far as he could tell from when he was giving her advice, Yuuhi was a cute girl. It seemed that the boy she was interested in was in the same year as Keiki. What a sleazebag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Shouma, having two beautiful older sisters like them giving you so much attention is actually a reward, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd much rather have little sisters in grade school. They'd be much more welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your honor, this lolicon is done for…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Said lolicon, Akiyama Shouma, took a smartphone out of his pocket. A picture of his lovely girlfriend was on the screen. It was the swimsuit picture that Koharu had taken in Mizuha's room during their last fight. Shouma let out a long sigh while fondly gazing at the picture of his girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm looking forward to the school trip, but not being able to see Koharu- chan for three days is a bit tough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The school trip hasn't even officially started yet, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Shouma acting like this already was worrisome. He was the type of weirdo who might really end up sick with "Koharu-tan deficiency."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'm glad to see that the two of you are doing as well as ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. It all happened because I had trouble deciding between her and a grade school student, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better reflect on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan is so cute… I want to go hug her right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please keep those fantasies to yourself. Seriously, that's kind of disgusting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki pulled away as Shouma started to become overly excited from staring at the loli swimsuit picture. If Shouma weren't his friend, Keiki might have called the police right then and there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wait. Disgusting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Keiki found himself repeating his own words. At the same time, an idea came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I could have just done that all along…" "Hmm? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I've come up with a way to cure all these perverts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Let me hear it." Shouma seemed interested, and he even looked up from his phone screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, I just have to become the pervert myself." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instantly, Shouma's excited expression vanished and was replaced by a blank stare. Shortly afterwards, however, his gaze turned into one of pity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki… You can't just force a girl to become your pet or start stepping on her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't. You've seriously got the wrong idea. Stop looking at me like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seriously hurt to have a lolicon staring at him with a gaze of contempt. Keiki quickly started explaining so as to not let this misunderstanding grow any worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just going to act like I've turned into a pervert. Then I'll just assume everyone's respective fetishes and become a pervert just like they are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For example, what would you do if I was attracted to body odor and was always trying to take panties off of girls?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would completely forsake you and distance myself from you as much as I… Ahh, that's what you mean!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like you've got the idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, it wasn't a difficult thing to grasp. All that Keiki had been going through all this time had just been because he was on the receiving end of a bunch of perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I suddenly start acting like each girl does all the time, they'd be disgusted as well, right? At the very least, they'd be repulsed. When that happens, they should start reflecting on what they've been doing all this time and hopefully find the motivation to better themselves. Basically, I'll become a bad example that they can learn from."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuika-chan was trying to tie me up a while ago, I turned the tables on her and had her reflect on her actions for a bit. It seemed to work well. That means that this operation might work for the other perverts as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though they might be used to being perverts, being the victim of a pervert could be a devastating experience. They would have to go through everything that Keiki had to. They would be sexually harassed, have their hopes crushed, realize their wrongdoings, and turn into normal girls. It was the perfect plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An eye for an eye, a pervert for a pervert. I'll call it the 'Negative Example</p>
<p class="null-p">Operation'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That name might need some rewording, but this idea might actually work." "Heh, heh, heh. Right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But can you really start acting like a pervert that easily?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem there. I'll just have to act like everybody around me has been."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been the victim of these perverts countless times already. He definitely had all their attack patterns memorized perfectly. Reenacting them shouldn't be any trouble at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, heh, heh. I'm really looking forward to this school trip now." "Your face makes you look like the villain, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki flashed a truly un-protagonist-like smile. A few minutes later, the bus filled with students from class 2B safely arrived at its destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as the name of the school trip suggested, their destination was a large inn nestled deep in the mountains. The four-story building looked rather new, especially as it stood tucked away in the forest. This place was rather famous for its baths in the forest. The baths were sort of natural therapy for people who hiked through the woods or camped in the area. Now that November was nearing its end, however, the number of hotel guests had dropped rapidly, allowing the school to rent this place with no major problems.</p>
<p class="null-p">After stepping off the bus and collecting their suitcases, Keiki and Shouma started carrying their belongings to their room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A clean Japanese-style room is the best thing ever." "Yeah, it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them were assigned to a Japanese room on the second floor. The room measured eight tatami mats, or around 13 meters square. They always slept on Western-style beds at home, but futons were a nice change of pace</p>
<p class="null-p">every once in a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're pretty lucky, though. Being able to have one room for just the two of us is pretty great."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah. It's way better than being packed in a tiny room with a ton of people."</p>
<p class="null-p">During their stay in this inn, Keiki and Shouma would be have this room all to themselves. Normally, four people would be assigned to a room, but because the number of boys in class B didn't divide evenly, their room assignments had ended up like this. As an aside, the rooms on floor three and above were reserved for the girls, so no boys would not be allowed to go up there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that the other boys think you're some sort of harem king, so things could have ended pretty badly for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That rumour is completely false, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki was the only boy in the calligraphy club, which was otherwise packed to the brim with beautiful girls. What's more, he was on good terms with all of them, so he was referred to by many people as the 'Harem King'. In reality, it was less of a harem and more of a pervert-filled hell for him, but nobody aside from him knew about their weird fetishes, so he garnered gazes of harsh envy from the other boys around him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've heard that there's some tips and tricks for creating a harem of normal girls. I'd love to have someone teach them to me," Keiki muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm interested in that as well. I'd love to create a loli harem," Shouma agreed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll tell Koharu-senpai you said that." "Ahaha, I was just joking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really doesn't sound like a joke since it's coming from you, Shouma." Considering that Shouma had once eyed a grade school girl while his</p>
<p class="null-p">girlfriend was with him, Keiki wasn't fully convinced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we've taken care of our belongings, so we have to make our way out there again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, we'll be making curry for lunch."</p>
<p class="null-p">According to the school trip schedule, they were supposed to take care of their belongings, rest up for a bit, and then make curry with their classmates.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who thought that it was a good idea to cook outside in the cold? Seriously."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, making curry is just something you gotta do during school trip, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki sat down on a floor cushion as he flipped through the guidebook. Just then, he heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, who might that be?" "Shouma, could you get it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure," Flashing a wry smile at Keiki's laziness, Shouma went to check the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma opened the door that led to the hallway, talked with someone for a moment, and returned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's for you, Keiki." "For me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lifting his head from the guidebook, the person Keiki saw was none other than-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry for intruding…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Fujimoto Ayano. She was wearing denim shorts and black tights with a hoodie over her head. The girl seemed a bit nervous as she gave a quick bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?" "Ah, well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki asked her that, she awkwardly glanced over at Shouma. "Alright, I'm gonna go head out to the cooking spot a bit early." "Yeah, I'll meet you there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Quickly grasping the atmosphere and Ayano's intentions, Shouma swiftly stepped out of the room. After seeing him off, Keiki spoke to the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess have a seat for now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah." Nodding along, Ayano sat down on a floor cushion in front of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she was seated, Keiki opened his mouth. "So what brings you here?" "Actually, I have something to talk about with Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's very important."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I see…" Keiki's intuition was already telling him what would happen next.</p>
<p class="null-p">In all likelihood, this is where she's going to try to take my underwear again!</p>
<p class="null-p">His sixth sense had already deduced this. The important subject she wanted to talk about would undoubtedly be his underwear again. Though she probably wouldn't use a sleeping pill to try and take it by force again, her intentions were as clear as day. After all, she was a smell fetishist who would get</p>
<p class="null-p">aroused whenever she smelled a boy's body odor. She had obviously come up with a sure-fire plan to finally capture Keiki's underwear that she had been trying to get for quite some time now.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this situation might actually be a chance for me, too!</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Ayano were in different classes. Since she was in class A, there wouldn't normally be very many chances for them to spend time together. He had been trying to think about how best to approach her in order to start his operation, but having the enemy come see him was an appreciated move.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright! I'll have to start sniffing her before she gets a chance to make a move on me! I'll let you experience firsthand how embarrassing it is to have someone of the opposite sex try to smell you!</p>
<p class="null-p">The first one to strike would be the winner. Before Ayano could ask for his underwear, he made the first move.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san!" Eh? …W-What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before we talk about that, I have a big favor to ask of you." "What kind of favor?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you… give me your panties, Fujimoto-san?" "…Fueh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Ayano wore an expression that he had never seen on her before. Her eyes went wide when she heard the perverted words leaving Keiki's mouth. She was unable to grasp the meaning of his words for a second, but then her face turned as bright red as a tomato.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh?! My p-panties?! Why?!" The vice president showed quite a reaction as she loudly screamed. She started panicking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, that would be a perfectly normal reaction for a girl who was asked</p>
<p class="null-p">to hand over her panties. However, Keiki wasn't done yet. He decided to press this perfect opportunity, and he quickly closed the distance between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to smell the scent of your panties, Fujimoto-san!" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said this phrase, which was the worst kind of thing you could say to a girl, Ayano swallowed her words. It was the exact reaction Keiki had been hoping for, in this 'Negative Example Operation.' These perverted girls were used to sexually harassing someone, but not being harassed in return. Just by reversing the roles of boy and girl, the line 'please give me your underwear' turned into nothing short of a crime, but Keiki had to ignore that for now. If someone saw them like this, he would definitely be reported to the police.</p>
<p class="null-p">This thought among others were racing around inside his head, and his heart was beating tremendously fast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that a no…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Even if you… suddenly ask me that so earnestly…" "You ask me the exact same thing pretty often, though." "That's true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what if we do an exchange?" "Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't you offer to do that before? You said you wouldn't mind trading my underwear for your panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I did say that, but…" "But what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Having someone sniff my underwear is… well… embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's my line, Keiki thought to himself. Being hugged suddenly out of nowhere, having someone bury her face into you chest, and having your scent sniffed all the time was totally embarrassing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, you can't comply with my request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nod, nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped, then. I'll give up on your panties." "…Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, I'll go ahead and sniff you directly." "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was in full-fledged olfactophile mode now. A true pervert wouldn't simply stop after being denied a pair of panties. After demanding Ayano's fresh scent, Keiki stood up from his seat, moved towards her, and used her bewilderment to catch her between his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Kiryuu-kun?!" Sniff, sniff, sniff. "~~~?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he started running his nose down her neck to get a good whiff of her, Ayano let out an inaudible scream. Even though she desperately tried to free herself from him, she couldn't win against the boy's raw strength, and was only able to cower as this sniffing was done to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You smell crazy good, Fujimoto-san." "D-Don't say… hya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time his nose touched her skin, her body twisted at the ticklish feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">While sadistic desires started to well up inside his body, a bit of anxiety nagged at the back of his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">I won't get arrested for this, right…?</p>
<p class="null-p">A harsh feeling of guilt and discomfort plagued him, but this was something the girl normally did to him. It didn't just end with her hugging him once or twice while she sniffed him. On top of that, now that he had come this far, stopping here was not an option. Thus, he decided to continue enjoying the scent of this beauty in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuhahahahaha! Now this is charging my energy up quite a bit!!!" "K-Kiryuu-ku…Sto…p…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki got even more engrossed in his acting. At the same time, Ayano could barely force any words out of her mouth. As sweat started to slowly built up on her neck, her erotic appeal grew even more, giving Keiki a feeling as if they were doing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto-san's bright red face is really cute…</p>
<p class="null-p">Not being able to get enough of her embarrassed expression, his heart started beating even faster, even though he wasn't normally sadistic. Indeed, he was completely aware that he was doing something horribly bad. He started feeling worse and worse, and felt immense pity for Ayano, but he couldn't stop. He had to keep going until she gave up on his underwear. In order for that to happen-</p>
<p class="null-p">"In order to repay you for all the trouble I've gone through, I'll take my time and thoroughly sniff you now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, nooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to make completely sure that it would be a success on the first try, he stuck persistently to her neck, taking deep sniffs. He had completely resigned himself to the fact that his actions right now were irreversible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fuhahahahaha! Now realize that this is what you've been doing to me all this</p>
<p class="null-p">time! Regret all of this as you suffer just as I have!</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that he was close to his first victory, Keiki's felt himself getting more and more excited. However, just when he decided to go in for the killing blow-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What…are you doing?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl's voice rang out, and it wasn't Ayano's. When he slowly and reluctantly turned around, he spotted a reddish-brown sidetail. A girl was standing there, wearing long jeans and white knitted garments. Nanjou Mao's gaze was as cold as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ummmm… What brings you here, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to check if you and Akiyama were actually flirting, so I came to watch, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure have some crazy fantasies! Who would do that with a boy?!" "You're right. You seem to prefer the vice president over Akiyama, anyway." "Uoooooooooooooooawawahaha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mao said that, Keiki jumped away from Ayano. Having been freed from the fiendish hands of this pervert, Ayano sunk down to the floor, her face still as red as could be. Watching the victim's reaction, Mao once again fixed her ice-cold glare on Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniffing girls like that. I see. So that's your thing, Kiryuu…" "You're wrong!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what exactly am I wrong about? I would really love to hear you try to talk yourself out of this one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that there's plenty of proof against me, but hear me out first!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how he spun it, it was true that he had been sniffing a girl. Clearing up this misunderstanding might actually be impossible this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If you're into this sort of thing, you can always just tell me, and…" "What? Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Forget it! I don't care about you anymore, Kiryuu!" Her voice getting more and more agitated with every syllable, Mao turned her back to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tried to stop her, and he reached out with one hand. "Wait… Wait a second, Nanjou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't get any closer, you pervert!" "Pervert?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Spitting those words out, his classmate stormed out of the room. Her last words were like a knife stabbing directly into his chest, and he sank down to the floor, just like Ayano had done.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She… called me a pervert. Nanjou… called me a pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring a girl's pleas and forcing yourself on her to get a whiff of her scent would only ever be done by a total pervert. He had determined that he wanted to become like a pervert, but being told this outright caused far more mental damage than he had anticipated. He hadn't imagined that being treated like a pervert by a girl would hurt this much. At the same time, having barely recovered, Ayano stood up shakily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm going on ahead as well…" "Ah, Fujimoto-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit of red still lingered in her expression, but she quickly fixed her jumbled clothes and dashed out of the room. Left alone in the room, Keiki could only blankly stare at the door and softly mutter to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…How did things end up like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, he had absolutely no excuses for his actions. From Ayano's point of view, she had been suddenly assaulted by a boy behind closed doors, and in Mao's eyes, he had completely turned into a perverted bastard who would get aroused by sniffing a girl's scent. As a result, he had earned a full portion of Mao's anger, and Ayano even ran away from him. All the trust he had worked so hard to build up between them had crumbled away because of one mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I'll go make some curry, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, he had to prioritize clearing up the misunderstanding between them as quickly as possible. He knew that all too well, but being labeled a pervert was too much for him to handle, so he escaped reality and fled towards curry, hoping that their anger would be subdued at least a bit by then.</p>
<p class="null-p">At a camping site a little ways away from the inn, at the cooking location. All the second-year students from all the different classes, had grouped into their separate classes, and were in the middle of making curry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone sure is enjoying themselves. Even though it's pretty cold." "I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Shouma were in front of the fire, tending it, while taking sideways glances at their classmates, who were energetically cutting ingredients and washing rice. Since they were quite a ways away from the city, deep in the mountains, the air was dramatically colder. Their other classmates were all wearing warm clothing, and the girls with skirts were wearing tights. There wasn't anyone tough enough to want to walk around bare-footed. Of course, Shouma and Keiki weren't any different.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo! Boys from the 6th group, good work out there."</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice calling out to them from the side belonged to a long-haired girl. "Ahh, Onizuka-san. Sup."</p>
<p class="null-p">The full name of said girl was Onizuka Megumi. She was a classmate from 2B, and she was assigned to the same group as them for this event. She was wearing a knit cardigan and a skirt, and was a bit shorter than your average 2nd grade student. The aforementioned 6th group consisted of Keiki, Shouma, Mao, and Megumi. Megumi flashed them a warm, friendly smile as she spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since everything over there is coming along nicely, I came to see how you boys were doing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. All we're doing is standing around in front of the cooking fire, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I feel pretty bad leaving all the cooking to the girls," Shouma commented with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Well, I honestly can't win against Nanjou-chan's cooking abilities. She's really amazing. Instead of having me helping her out, I feel like she'll be faster doing it all on her own."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That I can agree on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might not look like it, but Nanjou is quite family-oriented."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou had grown up in a single-mother family, and she herself had told Keiki how she had learned to do everything herself. Even the omurice she had made for the culture festival had been amazing. If they left the cooking to Mao, the 6th group's curry would be guaranteed to be tasty. While Keiki was busy looking forward to it, Megumi stood next to him, staring deeply at his expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey hey, Kiryuu-shi1? "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's one thing that's been on my mind… Did something happen between you and Nanjou-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was wondering about that, as well. It seemed like she was avoiding you," Shouma spoke from the sidelines.</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi nodded in agreement.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_6.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the two of them had picked up on the weird atmosphere between Keiki and Mao as they worked on the curry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, some stuff happened…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki himself unable to openly admit what had happened (for good reasons), so he directed his gaze over to the cooking area. Standing there was Mao with a sour expression on her face, putting the potatoes into the pot. When their gazes met, she quickly averted her gaze with a Hmph expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">After watching all that from beginning to end, Megumi broke out in a grin. "Is this… a lovers' quarrel, by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No it's not. Nanjou and I aren't like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I totally thought that you two seemed really close…" Megumi's eyes blinked a few times, as if she really hadn't expected that response.</p>
<p class="null-p">If people being on fairly good terms immediately made them a couple, the world would be overrun by them. Keiki knew that Mao only saw him as a male friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, nothing major happened, so don't worry too much about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? Well, if you say so. But it'd be best if you made up quickly, otherwise the rest of the school trip is going to be really awkward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'll do my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so he said, but making up with Mao would definitely be no easy feat. Talking it out would be pretty hard, considering that she wasn't even making eye contact with him. And the problem wasn't just Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto-san totally ran away from me too, didn't she?</p>
<p class="null-p">When he tried to call out to her, hoping to make things right again, she just ran away even faster. That being said, after what she had gone through, that</p>
<p class="null-p">was an appropriate reaction. If he didn't explain the situation fairly soon, he'd stay as nothing more than a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around one hour later, the cooking was complete. The rice the boys were responsible for was cooked, and the curry that Mao had worked on alone was also done. Moving to a pavilion, the six groups with four people each sat at their tables. Next to Keiki was Shouma, and the two of them were facing Megumi, with Mao seated next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, this seriously looks delicious!" Megumi's eyes sparkled as she gazed at the lineup of food in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-chan, you're really good at cooking, huh?" Shouma complimented Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really. Curry is just pretty easy," Chef Mao responded dismissively.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't because she was in a bad mood, but rather that she acted like this towards anyone. Her friend Shouma aside, even their classmate Megumi knew that very well, so she didn't particularly pay it any mind. However, there was one person who didn't offer any words of praise for the meal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a meek expression on his face, Kiryuu Keiki gazed down at his food. The reason for that was the very curry right in front of him. Though his food had also been made by Chef Mao today, there was one big problem with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… Nanjou-san? My curry is… well, pretty red?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, there was one major difference between his curry and the curry belonging to the other group members. Frankly speaking, it was red. There was no other way to describe it but to call it red. Anyone watching from the sidelines would agree that this curry was seriously dangerous, and would avoid it at all costs. In response, Mao opened her mouth, her face as expressionless as before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made it extra spicy just for Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spicy, huh?" Gazing down at the curry again, he gulped out of fear as he considered the sheer amount of spice that must be in there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, you're right. Your rice is as red as hell, Kiryuu-shi," Megumi commented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you sure that's edible?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Megumi and Shouma's expressions turned dark as they took a closer look at the curry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not very good with spicy stuff, though…" Keiki protested. "Are you saying that you can't eat my curry?" Mao asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No… Thank you for the food…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Eating everything served to them was something of a Kiryuu family motto. Spicy curry was no exception. Holding the spoon with a shaking hand, he scooped up some curry and rice and brought it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… H-Hoooooooot?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It tasted exactly as hot as it looked. The food exploded with fiery heat the instant he put it into his mouth, causing him immediate pain. Honestly, this wasn't something you could even categorize as food. Keiki's hand with the spoon stopped after one scoop, and both Megumi and Shouma gently called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry, I'll take care of everything once you're gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it was only for a short time, I really enjoyed our time together, Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, am I going to die?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of joke was this? Was he going to die because of his last meal? But he knew that leaving anything on the plate would only fuel Mao's anger</p>
<p class="null-p">even further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ugh. Whatever happens, happens!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever the taste might be, the curry wasn't at fault. The other three were happily eating their own curry. Keiki gave them a sideways glance before he forced himself to continue eating his own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Now that I've gotten used to it, it's not that bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Either his body had gotten used to the spiciness, or his sense of taste had been completely ruined. Whatever the case might be, he found himself unable to stop eating. At first, he thought his mouth would burn up in flames, but now the spice felt like a light prickle, and he could eat the rest of it without paying too much attention to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the food…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While sweating from the heat, Keiki finished his last scoop and put down the spoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was quite a fight, but… ugh… it feels my mouth is on fire…" "Are you okay? Do you want some water?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, Onizuka-san," Keiki accepted the cup from Megumi and gulped it down all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the spicy aftertaste didn't disappear, and he could still feel it stinging his entire mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That isn't helping. It's not getting better even after drinking some water." "Oh really? That sounds tough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was on his knees now. With no other choice, Keiki decided to go buy some juice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going back to the inn to buy something to drink. I left my wallet in my</p>
<p class="null-p">room, so it might take me a little while." "Understood. We'll take care of the rest for you." "Thanks a bunch."</p>
<p class="null-p">After thanking them, Keiki left. After watching him walk off, Shouma turned his gaze to Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something happen between you two? Why did you make Keiki's curry spicy like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means something did happen." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao fell silent when she realized she had dug her own grave. Megumi spoke up as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was it a lover's quarrel, after all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No it's not. Kiryuu and I aren't like that at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi asked her the same question she had asked Keiki, and Mao gave the same response as Keiki did.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's really not like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Muttering that to no one in particular, Mao finished her own curry and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm gonna go check."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao left behind these words and headed towards the inn herself, not waiting for a response. Not saying what she was going to check up on was very much like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Akiyama-shi." "What is it, Onizuka-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Nanjou-chan one of those 'tsunderes' by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did you not know?" Shouma let out a heartfelt laugh. "Mao-chan is a prime example of a tsundere."</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, far away in the Momosawa private high school, which was devoid of the entire second year student population.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Witch-senpai?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't you say you had something funny to tell Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about I tell you something funny about your chest, Koga-san?" "That's not funny at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the calligraphy club room, the only club members present where Tokihara Sayuki and Koga Yuika, and they were completely lost as to how they should spend their boring lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sigh, it sure is boring without Keiki-senpai around." "Oddly enough, I agree with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He must be enjoying his school trip." "He might be."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why is Yuika forced to stay here with Witch-senpai of all people?" "How would I know? If you hate it that much, you didn't have to come here</p>
<p class="null-p">in the first place." Sayuki furrowed her eyebrows at her Kouhai's cheeky words, but she quickly thought of something and spoke again. "Well, I can't imagine you have any friends, so it's a small wonder why here would be the only place you can go during lunch break."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that true of Witch-senpai, as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't deny that. We both are spending a rather lonely school life, aren't we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't lump Yuika in with the likes of you. She's lonely without Keiki- senpai here, but Yuika at least has some special plans for later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, how arrogant."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was always this cheeky with everyone. However, Sayuki held her pride as a Senpai, and she calmly responded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So would you be inclined to tell me what wonderful plans you have?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, don't fall off your chair. Yuika actually has a sleepover planned with Airi tonight!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… did you just say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A sleepover. Sayuki couldn't hold back her shock when such a normie word came out of her Kouhai's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You mean that kind of sleepover?! Where you take a bath with your friends, play before going to bed, and have love talk while you're in your pyjamas?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. We'll be shopping today after school, and we're even going to have some fancy pasta for dinner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fancy pasta?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A really rich, creamy pasta."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's actually really fancy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Two girls with fancy pasta. Those words alone were enough to shake Sayuki, who had never made any friends, to her core.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since when were you two so close…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, are you jealous~? Yuika isn't a loner like Witch-senpai, you know~" "E-Even I have friends, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh? Do tell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"L-Like… Ootori-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did that turn into a question at the end?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shut up… Also, before getting along with Nagase-san like that, you didn't have any friends either, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, Sayuki would be lying if she said she wasn't jealous. Because of family reasons, Sayuki never went to things like sleepovers. It was a completely different world to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, Yuika will send you some pictures of it later, okay~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of boasting is that? Your terrible personality is getting worse and worse… Ah, you just came to the clubroom to brag, didn't you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, heh. If you're that frustrated by it, then you just have to do it as well." "Hmph, just you wait…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki could no longer ignore the ridicule of her sassy Kouhai. "Fine then! I'll have my own sleepover with Ootori-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after that, Sayuki called Koharu on her phone, explained the situation, and the two of them promised to hold a sleepover of their own.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Mao had said, she followed Keiki back into the inn, where he planned on buying something to drink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's not in the lobby…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't spot her target near the vending machine on the first floor, nor was he at the inn store. He mentioned that he had left his wallet in his room, so he was probably going to pick that up. Thus, Mao decided to head up to the boys' floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though he really pissed me off, I guess I was going too far with the spice…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even she herself was aware that she was acting fairly childish. She was very flustered when she caught him and the vice president Ayano being all flirty with each other, which caused her to make the boy's rice extra spicy to try to vent her anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu seems to be pretty close with the vice president, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That much was explainable by his short-term employment as a student council assistant. At first, it just looked like Ayano was being overly clingy with him, but after his work there, Keiki himself seemed to actively seek her out from time to time, at least as far as Mao could tell.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are they secretly going out? But Kiryuu isn't the kind of guy who would be able to hide something like that…</p>
<p class="null-p">Then what exactly was the situation that Mao had stumbled into? If they weren't lovers, why would Keiki embrace Ayano like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, it's probably just him getting wrapped up in something weird again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had the tendency to get wrapped up in all sorts of problematic situations. It was pretty obvious, considering that lots of perverted girls seemed to like him. With that in mind, the vice president might be hiding a</p>
<p class="null-p">secret of her own, as well. Mao would have to ask Keiki about that later. There was something else that piqued her interest more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is Keiki actually one of those people with a smell fetish?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the most prominent question plaguing Mao's mind. He had boldly declared that he liked big breasts, but most boys never tell girls about their tastes and preferences.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, this kind of fetish would still be totally acceptable…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao figured she'd be fine even if the person she liked had a smell fetish. Naturally, smelling her underwear or smelling her right after gym class would be a bit too much, but sniffing her hair or body on occasion wasn't something that'd freak her out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah, having the person I like do it might not be so bad…</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that to herself, Mao felt jealous that the vice president had gotten her neck sniffed by Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After becoming a couple, that level of skinship should totally be fine as well… A-Ah, it's still a bit too early to be going out and all that, but…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao waved her hands and lost composure just from thinking about it. Luckily, all the other students were currently out, so nobody spotted her acting this much like a pure maiden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… I do want to be like that with Keiki in the near future…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, she didn't want to do away with their enjoyable friendship right now. However, her wish to start an even more intimate relationship with him was even stronger. In order to achieve that, she resolved to make some progress during this school trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">All right. I'll apologize for the curry, and I'll hear him out. He said something about it being a misunderstanding, so we just have to make up!</p>
<p class="null-p">The school trip had barely started. She didn't want it to start with their</p>
<p class="null-p">relationship getting worse right off the bat. She made up her mind and stopped in front of her destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? The door is open…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she reached out to knock, she realized that the door was a tiny bit ajar. Not to mention that she could hear some deep breathing coming from inside the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">What's going on in there? Thinking that something was off, Mao carefully opened the door as quietly as possible and entered the room. After slipping off her shoes and creeping forward just a bit, she arrived at the eight-tatami room. The scene Mao saw left her in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…K-Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was so surreal that she doubted her eyes at first. In Keiki's hands was a pair of sky-blue panties. It wasn't a boy's pair of underwear by any means. It was a normal pair of panties that a girl would wear, and he was rubbing it against his nose. At the same time, he was taking deep sniffs from the panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy Mao liked was feverishly sniffing the panties of another girl. 1 Megumi uses a really respectful suffix for other boys</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: Why are you here, Panties?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's turn the clock back a few minutes.</p>
<p class="null-p">After he finished eating Mao's special extra-spicy curry, Keiki's mouth screamed for something sweet to drink, thus he returned to his room to grab his wallet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… The inside of my mouth is still stinging. I guess I'll get some milk tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">All feeling in his tongue had disappeared, and he wanted to cool it down a bit with a good dose of sugar so the pain would stop. He went over to his backpack in the room and opened the zipper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm, where did I put my wallet again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He remembered putting it in the upper part, but couldn't find it when he searched there. He definitely remembered putting it in there the evening prior.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it was deeper in the back."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he dug through his change of clothes that he had brought for the second day, he spotted his trusted wallet. Now he would finally be able to purify the inside of his mouth from the lingering spiciness. Not wanting to waste any more time like this, he quickly reached deep in the backpack, taking out the wallet. When he did, a frilly object followed along with the wallet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm? What's this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">An object with a strong sky-blue color greeted him, but he had no recollection of ever putting it in there. When he lifted it above his head and opened it up, he found out that it was a cute pair of girls' underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are there panties here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Does something like this ever actually happen in reality? Who finds a pair girl's panties deep inside their belongings just like that? Well, this was reality no matter how Keiki turned and twisted it, so keeping it theoretical wouldn't help much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whose panties are they, even…? No, when did they put them in my backpack…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had no memory nor any idea as to how the panties had made their way into his backpack. A pair of underwear from the opposite sex just appearing like this never happens in reality, and it was certainly not an everyday occurrence. However, Keiki had experienced surreal things like this countless times. It had started with Cinderella's panties, an underclassman had stuffed her panties into his mouth, he had been forced to put panties on his commando little sister, and many more.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no experience actually dating girls, but his level of contact with panties was definitely superior to anyone else his age. And while this Panties Prince was wondering what was going on…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you know. For now…" Sniff, sniff.</p>
<p class="null-p">He sniffed them. He wanted to get a good whiff of the panties' scent. It was one of the few skills he had obtained while trying to figure out the identity of Cinderella. At first, he had hesitated for quite a bit, but now it was as routine for him as brushing his teeth in the morning. In this place with no one around, he chose the worst possible method of thorough investigation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmmm… All I'm smelling is a pleasant scent of soap…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That meant that this wasn't a new pair, but someone had used it before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, maybe just one more time to make sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter the job, you should check over it very thoroughly to make completely sure. Back when he was helping out in the student council, every member double-checked every document they worked on. Hence, one more time-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiff…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inspection complete. He hadn't gotten any new information since the first time, but it was better safe than sorry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, Nanjou already thinks I'm a pervert after that thing with Fujimoto-san, so if she sees me like this, it'll all be over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, who is-iiiiiiiiiiiiiit?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing his name called, Keiki instinctively turned around, wondering who it was… and speak of the devil, it was Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?! Why are you here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to see how you were doing…" While speaking, Mao's gaze dropped down to the panties in Keiki's hands, "…but I really didn't expect to find you in the middle of enjoying a girl's panties like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're seriously mistaken, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In what way?! You were totally sniffing them, weren't you?! So you were a smell fetishist all along, Kiryuu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a misunderstanding!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, why do you even have those panties? You didn't steal them, did you?" "I most certainly did not steal them!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then whose are they?" "That's what I want to know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he knew, he would have returned them immediately. Putting something as dangerous as this in his belongings was problematic to the highest order, and he wanted to direct this complaint immediately at the person in question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Just to be sure… These aren't yours, right, Nanjou?" "As if they would be?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, figures."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't believe you! Kiryuu, you creep! Panty thief!" "I didn't steal them, though?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was quite a perilous situation for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of all the times, she had to see me sniffing them…</p>
<p class="null-p">If he didn't clear up the understanding here, it would all be over. Being branded a pervert would hurt more than he could imagine, and he might even be written up for alleged theft.</p>
<p class="null-p">Calm down… Calm down, Kiryuu Keiki!</p>
<p class="null-p">The more he panicked, the more it would make him seem like the perpetrator. He had to quickly reset his thoughts and calmly start deducing what had happened. No, there wasn't much to deduce. Only one of the perverts would do something like this. This backpack was in the inn room ever since they had arrived here, and the timeframe of when someone was able to put them inside was limited as well. Meaning there could only have been one individual capable of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">That means… This must be Mizuha's doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no mistaking it. It was Mizuha who had put them in his backpack</p>
<p class="null-p">this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, wait a second? If these are Mizuha's panties…" Then and there, Keiki had a terrible premonition.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… is she not wearing any panties right now?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there was a chance that she was wearing a different pair. However, though Kiryuu Mizuha might look like a cute, angelic girl from the outside, she was still a perverted exibitionist. Putting her own panties into her older brother's belongings was a perverted act that would totally suit her.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wouldn't be weird for her to go completely panties-free. Though he was hoping that she was wearing a pair when she had gone outside the room, Keiki had learned that nothing was written in stone when you were dealing with perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that Mizuha is wearing a skirt today…</p>
<p class="null-p">This morning when they walked to school together, she had been wearing a skirt with black kneesocks, and a sweater on top. Even if she was wearing a skirt, and even with the kneesocks, her defenses down there were basically nonexistent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou, sorry! There's an emergency! I'll explain myself later!" "Eh?! Hold on, Kiryuu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As her older brother, Keiki couldn't ignore the possibility of Mizuha spending the day outside without any panties. With hot emotions welling up inside of him, the desire to know, and if necessary, to make her wear panties, immediately caused him to move. He dashed out of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Where are you running off to, and why are you still holding onto those panties?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was left behind, still as confused as before.</p>
<p class="null-p">A skirt. It was an essential item, a piece of clothing in modern Japan, an object to protect a girl's most important place, although with rather low defensive power. With only the slightest influence, such as a gust of wind, everything shown beneath that thin piece of fabric would be revealed to everyone around. However, all that would be visible at that point would be underwear. Though panties alone weren't exactly the safest choice, and they weren't nearly enough to protect this most important place from being revealed to the public.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, there was a girl who willingly took off this final lifeline, who took off her panties. A student at the Momosawa Private High School, belonging to class 2E, Kiryuu Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl herself denied a girl's-no, humanity's-most important piece of clothing, as she was a pervert who enjoyed the thrill of going to school without wearing any panties. Naturally, she didn't do this every single day. Rather, there was what she called a 'No-panties day' that would happen on occasion, where she would determine to spend the entire day in school without wearing any panties. Right now, the very first day of the school trip, might just be one of those days. After all, Keiki had found a girl's pair of panties in his own belongings. Thanks to that, he had started to doubt. Is Mizuha wearing panties today? That doubt wouldn't leave him.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the event that she was indeed not wearing any panties, if her skirt didn't do its job of protecting Mizuha's crotch properly, it would be very dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hence Keiki hurried to investigate the current panty situation. "Mizuha…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Nii-san? Why are you in such a hurry?" "I was looking for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki finally found his little sister, she was still busy at the cooking area. She was currently washing the dishes, and there luckily weren't any other students nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come with me for a second."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He pulled her hand and brought her to a more isolated place. Luckily, they were surrounded by trees in this forest, so there were multiple possible places where they could escape from view. So that nobody would accidentally stumble upon them, he took her to an isolated place deep inside the forest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We should be fine this far away…" "What is it, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me be blunt. You were the one who put this inside my backpack, right?" "Ah, so you already figured it out."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki showed Mizuha the panties, the culprit immediately confessed. "Why would you do something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To put it simply, I did it out of frustration." "Frustration?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was getting excited and horny, thinking about how you were going to use my panties. Sniffing them, rubbing yourself with them, that kind of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's even worse of a reason than I anticipated!" He cursed himself mentally for actually sniffing them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you said that going to school without panties is prohibited from now on, and even though we're living together, you would never come peek on me when I was taking a bath… I've been holding back a lot, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of older brother would peek in on his little sister bathing?" "I would have been happy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">An exibitionist surely would have been happy, but Keiki wasn't that kind of a</p>
<p class="null-p">pervert, so her logic didn't work on him in the slightest. "…Well, let's ignore that for now. It's time for the main topic." "What topic is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me be straightforward. Mizuha, you are currently under suspicion of not wearing panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Under suspicion?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. As your older brother, I have a duty to check on your current panty situation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you want to know if I'm actually wearing panties or not, Nii-san?" "Exactly. I won't do anything bad, so just give me a straight answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">Depending on the answer, this wouldn't end with just a warning. Worst-case scenario, he would be forced to put panties on her himself again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… It's a secret." "Hey…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want to know that badly, why don't you check for yourself?" "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see… just lifting up the skirt would be boring… so film it with your phone, Nii-san. Inside my skirt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't do it, then I won't tell you~" "Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a video inside the skirt of his little sister would be an action</p>
<p class="null-p">absolutely devoid of reason. Though he had gone through various ways of dealing with Mizuha's exibitionistic tendencies, this time around her request had too high of a hurdle. That being said, if he didn't check right here, right now, he would keep wondering for the rest of the school trip if Mizuha was walking around without panties, and he would be restless the entire time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was she wearing panties, or was she not? Wondering about it the entire school trip would cause Keiki unbelievable stress.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what if she really isn't wearing any panties?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki would be filming a video of his little sister's defenseless and unprotected crotch with his own phone. That sort of thing could be taken to court.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, what kind of big brother would it make me if I just ignored the possibility that my little sister is walking around without panties? Isn't it my responsibility to make sure that nobody else will see her?</p>
<p class="null-p">After turning it over mentally, Keiki made up his mind. "Alright, I'll do it. As long as I can clear up my doubts!" "Okay, then let me prepare really quick."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Prepare for what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As her older brother tilted his head in confusion, Mizuha gently rolled up the front of her sweater.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on a second?!" "Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you rolling up your upper clothes?!" "This gets me more in the mood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to get in the mood, here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had raised her sweater enough that her breasts, wrapped in a sky-blue bra, were greeting Keiki. Her belly was completely visible, and this situation felt even more lascivious than if she was completely naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since her bra is the same color as the panties, that means she's not wearing any… right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, he couldn't judge just based on color alone. There was still the possibility that this might be a bluff. Either way, Keiki could only see for himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once I start lifting up my skirt, you can start, Nii-san." "R-Roger…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He certainly wasn't on board with this, but stepping down wasn't an option. He took his smartphone out of his pocket and put it on stand-by, ready to start filming. With her sweater still rolled up, her breasts in bare sight, Mizuha put both her hands on her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then let's start~ Take a good look, okay?" "Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surrounded by trees everywhere, the abnormal photoshoot began. "Mmm…" Slowly but steadily, Mizuha lifted up her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Keiki held his phone at the ready.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aha, Nii-san filming me like this, doing something bad like this gets my heart racing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl shown on the phone screen right now was undoubtedly a total creep. Most likely out of embarrassment-or worse-excitement, her cheeks were burning a strong red color, but her lips still formed a distorted smile, as she tasted the feeling of being filmed by her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">A normal girl would hate something like this…</p>
<p class="null-p">But in Mizuha's case, she looked truly happy about this situation. Her expression was distorted in pleasure, as she kept staring at the camera lens.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… Can you… see it now…?" "Yeah, just a bit more…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The hem of the skirt was reaching its limit of what it could cover. The place where the kneesocks couldn't hide her thighs was already revealed, showing her beautiful skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit more. Just a bit more, and the girl would reveal her secret place with her own two hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_7.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Keiki found himself loudly gulping out of anxiety, and he unconsciously put more strength into the hand holding the smartphone. At the same time, Mizuha continued to flash a lecherous smile towards the camera pointed at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tada! I'm wearing them today~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew… you really had me worried there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">On his little sister's lower half, Keiki could see a pair of panties with the same design as her bra. Mizuha had played him like a fiddle.</p>
<p class="null-p">And here I was planning on fixing her perversion. What am I doing being forced into a perverted situation like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he was more relieved than anything when he ascertained the panty situation of his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, thank you, Nii-san. Playing along with my exibitionistic roleplay." "No problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you can use that video however you want, okay?" "I won't use it, okay? Just put your skirt back down."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her skirt was still raised, and Keiki didn't know where to look. Every part of her body was poison to his eyes. When he averted his gaze, however, his eyes met those of Nanjou Mao, who was standing next to the trunk of a large tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Nanjou?! Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was searching for you since you weren't coming back…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she said that, Keiki realized that he had just left Mao back in the room. Since he had been out here the entire time, it made perfect sense that she had started searching for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had no idea you were the kind of pervert who would force your little sister to flip up her skirt for you… and you even filmed it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The misunderstanding got even worse?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I followed you two into the forest, and you were doing this…" "No, but… Nanjou-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm terribly sorry for interrupting your fun. Please take your time."</p>
<p class="null-p">With eyes like a dead fish, Mao hurried away back in the direction she had come from.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again, you've got the wrong idea…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no mistaking it. She had a terrible misunderstanding. It was true that Keiki had been taking a video of his little sister's stripshow, but he didn't do so willingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like this has turned into something really troublesome," Mizuha commented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can say that again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't even have the energy to point out that Mizuha was the main reason for this problem. All he could do was hold his head in his hands and wonder how he had gotten into all this mess.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something really bad happened. Nanjou's affection towards me has dropped to an all-time low."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was around the time when the day was nearing its end, a bit past 7pm in the evening. Keiki was resting his body in the open-air bath of the inn, giving a quick report. Also present was Shouma, who gave a rather disinterested response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, sounds tough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really is, okay? It's the first time I've ever seen someone's affection towards me drop this quickly to such an extent, so this isn't the time to leisurely be taking a bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She ignored you the entire time during dinner after all. Just what did you do this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You'd better not tell anybody else." "I'm good at keeping secrets."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's a pretty complicated story, but-"</p>
<p class="null-p">He gave a quick but elaborate summary of what had happened. Retelling all the events where Mao had spotted him so far was horribly embarrassing, but he had to let out the frustration having built up thus far.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So Mao-chan saw you during your special perverted roleplays with Fujimoto-san and Mizuha-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't phrase it in a weird way like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">There were other boys present who might overhear them. Keiki would be dead meat if other people found out about all of this stuff happening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I explained everything to Mao, even the part about Mizuha's panties, but she won't forgive me at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And have you figured out why she's angry at you in the first place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well yeah, I've been friends with her for a very long time, so I can figure it out to a certain degree."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, how confident of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm acting flirty with people other than you, right? That means that she won't have any more material for her BL manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah, nevermind. You don't get it at all." "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like Mao-chan is the one who has it rough right now." "Eh, what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think Mao-chan would get angry at me if I told you, so I won't." "Ehhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'd be glad to help you to make up with her. You really helped me out when I was having a fight with Koharu-chan, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That'd be a big help."</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing you need in life is a friend you can rely on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The problem is what you can do to fix Mao-chan's current mood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Clearing up the misunderstanding is the most important part, but she isn't even listening to me in the first place. Well, there might be a way to solve that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I can guarantee her a picture with both you and me wearing towels, I think she might hear me out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I did say I was going to help, but offering my body is a bit…" The price to gain an advantage in this battle was high indeed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this will be pretty difficult if I can't play my BL card…" Keiki pondered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's something that would Mao-chan happy aside from BL?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A game?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was the type of person who would occasionally play a game at home, and she often frequented the game center.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a mobile game that I play with her sometimes, so maybe I can let her win?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think she'd still win even without you holding back." "That's not any good, then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you'd probably have to make up first or she probably wouldn't accept that invite."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's no good at all, then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fixing a girl's foul mood sure can be something difficult. "Say, Keiki, what exactly do you think of Mao-chan?" "Why are you asking me that so suddenly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no deeper meaning to it, so just think about it for a bit." "Ahh, well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the reason Shouma had asked him that was a mystery for him, he decided to play along with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you think about it, Nanjou is pretty amazing. She's always absolutely serious about everything she likes, she does the household chores for her busy parents, she's a trustworthy supporter, and she's actually pretty kind…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she puts on inconsiderate airs, she was always considerate of her surroundings. She was the type of wonderful girl who would sit next to a bed waiting for her friend to wake up after said friend got KO'd by a direct basketball pass to the face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How do I put it? I just seriously respect her." "Then how about you tell that to Mao-chan?" "As if I could tell her that face to face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The only reason why he could say such things was because the person in question wasn't present. However, there were also things he couldn't say if he wasn't in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I shouldn't try thinking of ways to weasel my way out of it. I should just seriously apologize to her, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds great."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking too deeply about a maiden's heart never worked. Honestly apologizing to her was the best way to deal with this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that that's decided…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, let's leave for now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both their faces were red, since they had been sitting in the bath for quite a long time. Thus, they quickly left. Otherwise Mao might find them and get the wrong idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">After changing into the yukatas that the inn provided, Keiki and Shouma stepped out of the changing room and ran into a familiar girl who had just stepped out of the woman's bath herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Nii-san and Shouma-kun. What a coincidence." "Hey there, Mizuha-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you took a bath as well, Mizuha… And, oh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right behind Mizuha, another yukata-wearing girl appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san was with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I met Kiryuu-san here, so we took a bath together." "I see. Quite the rare pair, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing them in yukata was already quite the sight, but he hadn't seen Mizuha and Ayano together before. They probably saw each other a few times during the culture festival, but meeting them together like this was a first for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was doing some naked socializing with Fujimoto-san," Mizuha said. "O-Ohh? I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We talked a lot about Kiryuu-kun," Ayano added. "What exactly were you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Said Kiryuu-kun couldn't help but be a bit worried. Both of them were the kind of people who would do or say whatever they wanted, so it wouldn't shock him if they had talked about their respective perverted events that had happened during the day. While he was busy worrying about the possibility, Shouma approached him and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seeing two girls right out of the bath is quite a soothing sight, isn't it?" "Yeah, you can say that again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would be even better if they were grade school kids and not students in the same year as us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I can't agree with that last part."</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, the sight of the two of them in yukata was quite appealing. "Anyway, you two look really great in yukata."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehehe, thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">When her older brother praised her, Mizuha showed a happy, bashful response. At the same time, Ayano's cheeks turned a bit red, and she hid behind Mizuha. She peeked at Keiki with a wary gaze, almost like a cat. In response, Mizuha seemed confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Fujimoto-san?" "I was taking refuge…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Refuge…?" Another question mark appeared on top of Mizuha's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Mizuha was obviously confused, her older brother already had a guess as to why Ayano was acting this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh right. Fujimoto-san still thinks I'm a smell fetishist…</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of all the things that had happened with Mao, it had completely slipped his mind. However, he couldn't clear up the misunderstanding with Mizuha standing there. Shouma, who had been watching from the sidelines, spoke up to throw him a lifeline.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. How about you two come up to our room for a bit? There's nobody else there, so we can talk as much as we want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then I'll gladly do that," Mizuha answered. "If Kiryuu-san is going…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mizuha agreed to the invitation, Ayano reluctantly agreed to, as well. "Are you good with that as well, Keiki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure, sounds good. We still have some free time before bedtime."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though boys weren't allowed to enter the girl's floors, the inverse of that was perfectly fine. Since they had no other roommates, nobody would complain either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we invite Mao-chan as well?" "Eh, Nanjou as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You want to make up with her, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it'll only worsen her mood, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha and Ayano-both of the girls she had caught him with-would be present. There was no way of knowing how much that would make things even worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But she'll be even more angry if she finds out that she was the one left out, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That does make sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she might not openly admit it, she enjoyed the company of others. The fact that she showed up at the festival and the calligraphy club's training camp was proof enough of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I guess I'll try my luck."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she'd probably just ignore him if he called, Keiki decided to send a quick message. He wrote 'We'll be meeting in my room in a bit if you want to join us. Mizuha and Fujimoto-san are also coming,' and he promptly received a quick 'I'm coming,' back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, Nanjou is in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work. I knew you could do it, Keiki." "Nii-san is so cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can do it if you set your mind to it, Kiryuu-kun." "Why does it feel like you're all sucking up to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know why they had all suddenly started praising him, but thanks to</p>
<p class="null-p">this short conversation, their evening was decided. If it were any other group of high school students, they would probably be looking forward to having girls in yukata around them for such a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki turned on the lights in their room and guided Mizuha with Ayano inside. Since they didn't have enough floor cushions for everyone, he had them sit down on the floor. Shouma checked his smartphone and then spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I got a text from Koharu-chan." "What does she say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like she's doing a sleepover with Tokihara-senpai?" "A sleepover?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She sent me an image, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, let me see." Keiki took a peek at Shouma's phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu probably took it without warning Sayuki, because Koharu had a peace sign up and was wearing a bright smile, while Sayuki had a surprised look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They seem to be having fun, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu in her pyjamas is seriously cute. I want to go hug her right now. I want to lick her all over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma…? That's a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His lolicon friend started saying really creepy things. However, as if they were watching a completely different scene unfold-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-senpai sure is loved by Shouma-kun." "Ayano-san is a bit jealous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Am I the weird one here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is having a boy lick her all over considered okay by girls' standards? While Keiki was busy being taken aback by Mizuha's and Ayano's reactions, a knock came from the door and two more yukata-clad girls entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for intruding." "Hello there~"</p>
<p class="null-p">One of them had a reddish-brown sidetail: Nanjou Mao. The other one with fluffy long hair had been a member of their group during lunchtime: Onizuka Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Onizuka-san is here, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-chan and I are sharing a room, after all. She suddenly said she'd be going over to your guys' room, so I thought I'd join her since it sounded interesting… Ah, but I can leave if you'd rather me not be here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind." "Same here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Keiki and Shouma gave their consent, and Mizuha and Ayano nodded in affirmation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks a bunch. Then I'd be glad to join you." Flashing a friendly and welcoming smile, Megumi joined the group.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, Keiki called out to Nanjou. "You too, Nanjou. Thanks for coming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Whatever. If I leave you unattended, who knows what you might do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she sounded as cold as always, a cold response was better than none, honestly. Thus, the six people seated themselves inside the eight tatami room, forming a circle. Keiki sat with his back to the window. From there, it went</p>
<p class="null-p">clockwise: Mizuha, Ayano, Mao, Megumi, and Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally Fujimoto-san would always sit right next to me to get as much of my scent as possible, but she's probably still wary of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano most likely was using Mizuha as a barrier between her and Keiki. Although the room was eight tatami mats large, it was already pretty full with six people in it. Since two of the girls were fresh out of the bath, a sweet fragrance filled the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having girls in yukata come over to play in your room is quite the wonderful event, I have to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if most of them were perverts through and through, Keiki couldn't help but feel grateful right now. In the middle of them, the only normal girl, Megumi, looked around the group.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I think the only person I haven't met so far here is Kiryuu-shi's little sister. Hi, I'm Onizuka Megumi from class 2B. Nice to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu Mizuha. 2E. Nice to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since they hadn't met before, the two of them exchanged a quick greeting. Watching over them, Keiki felt something was off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means that Fujimoto-san and Onizuka already know each other?" "Yup. Though we only talked a little bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, we just talked a small bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi spoke up in a lighthearted manner, and Ayano agreed with her, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">What was that just now…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's voice sounded a bit more clouded than usual. Although Keiki had a bad premonition when he heard this exchange, he had no actual proof of anything. An uncertain feeling filled his chest, but it quickly disappeared</p>
<p class="null-p">when Shouma spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be a bit boring, but how about we play some cards? I'd be down for some daifugô1."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that sounds fun. Let's do it!" Megumi quickly agreed with Shouma's idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about adding some sort of punishment for the loser? That would make it more fun," Mao brought up another essential part of playing party games with others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about the loser has to strip?" Mizuha seemed to already have a rather specific punishment in mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha, Mizuha-chan is so funny. But doing that in front of the boys would be a bit of a problem~" Megumi said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, a reasonable opinion for once." Keiki doubted his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Tch, I thought I'd be able to see a boy stripping and would have a good reason for it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought he heard a rather fujoshi-like line coming from Mao, but he chose to ignore it. He was surrounded by perverts, and Megumi truly was the saving grace that helped him avoid the naked card game. Ayano then timidly and silently raised one hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about the loser has to think of a confession of love, and act it out?" "Oh, that's quite an extreme punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">A pretend confession of love. No doubt that would turn into a dark past you'd rather forget about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds fun. I'm in." "I'm fine with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No objections from me~" "Then that decides it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao, Mizuha, Megumi, and Shouma were all on board. "Seriously? Well, I guess I just have to win."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki, you're jinxing yourself by saying that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, the goddess of luck thought it would be a funny joke to let that jinx come true, and the boy was handed quite a formidable defeat. Weeping out an embarrassing confession was actually more boring than anticipated, so the punishment was removed, and they just played for fun after that. Since they were all fairly familiar with each other, nothing of importance happened, and they just spent a fun time together.</p>
<p class="null-p">After changing the game to old maid, and after pulling the losing card, Megumi brought a new topic to the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kiryuu-shi? How's it looking in the calligraphy club? With love and all that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sure is an abrupt question."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you have Nanjou-chan, Kiryuu-chan, and several other beauties in there, and you're the only boy. I'd be more surprised if something didn't happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess it does look like some kind of harem situation," Keiki admitted.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was Mizuha's confession, and he couldn't deny that it looked a lot like a romcom, but sadly, the clubroom was overflowing with perversion instead of romance. That was the situation of the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you say, but there must be a girl you're at least interested in, right?" "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Megumi said those words with a grin, the expressions of the other three girls completely froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh? Is that so, Keiki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't fan the flames, Shouma…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he wanted to quickly change the topic, the group of girls looked like they weren't going to allow it. Following Megumi's lead, the other three closed in on Keiki, leaving him no chance to escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like to know about the person Nii-san likes." "Ayano-san is also brimming with interest." "Who is it, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha and Ayano were urging Keiki to continue, as even Mao seemed like she was at least slightly interested.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is going on? Why am I feeling some kind of intense pressure right now?</p>
<p class="null-p">An overwhelming force was emitting from the people around him, making Keiki want to run away immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…" "Kiryuu-kun…" "Kiryuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when cold sweat was starting to run down Keiki's cheek, Megumi's phone, which she had put on the desk earlier, vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, excuse me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She picked it up, and after checking the screen, she apologetically lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, but I've got a call from my club comrades to meet up right now." "I didn't know you were in a club, Onizuka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm actually in the manga research club. I'm the only girl there, so I'm kind of like the Otasa princess2."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the first time I've seen one in person," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh, aren't you pretty similar to me, Kiryuu-shi? You're the harem king of the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a harem king, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, I don't feel like it's too far off, though… Well, this might be your only chance to be this flirty with girls around you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'll have to excuse myself for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The self-proclaimed Otasa Princess hurriedly stepped out of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nice timing there, manga research club people!</p>
<p class="null-p">The pressure coming from Mao and the others had lessened, so Keiki found a chance to escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright then, it's about time that we turn in, as well." "Ahh, Nii-san is running away~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, you sissy." "Hmph…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the girls all voiced their discontent, since Megumi herself had already left, and since it was already getting pretty late, they might as well call it quits here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good night, Nii-san. Akiyama-kun as well." "Thanks for the invite."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Mizuha and Ayano quickly gave up, and as Mao went to follow after them, Keiki quickly stopped her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou, do you have a second?" "Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have something to talk about. Could you come with me for a second?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Sayuki was enjoying her sleepover with Koharu. The two of them were talking about all sorts of things inside her room at the Tokihara residence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Really, you have to tell me before you take a picture like that. Thanks to that, I made a weird face."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu sat on the cushion, and Sayuki complained as she sulked on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, about that picture. I sent it to Shouma-kun, so Kiryuu-kun might end up seeing it, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I made sure to take a cute one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Having you compliment me on my weird face doesn't make me happy at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Checking the picture for herself, Sayuki let out a faint sigh. She had a perfect surprised expression on her face, obviously not having expected a picture at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, enough of the picture. Anyway, I'm sorry for suddenly inviting you</p>
<p class="null-p">over to my house today. I know I must have been a bother." "No, no. I'm happy that I got to talk with Tokihara-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuika's confident announcement, Sayuki called Koharu, who replied quickly with "Sure, a sleepover sounds fun," not even stopping to think about it twice. That being said, Sayuki still felt a bit guilty about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure feels a bit weird, being alone with Ootori-san like this." "We have chatted a lot over email and messages and such, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mostly about Akiyama-kun, though. That reminds me. Aren't you worried? He's on the school trip. What if he cheats on you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun is a lolicon, so he ignores all girls around his age and grade." "That's a pretty horrible reason to trust someone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My rivals are grade school girls, so…" Ootori-san said, and her eyes grew distant. "After all, I just look like a loli… I can't win against an actual grade school girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's not talk about that. You're opening a door to something that should forever stay locked away."</p>
<p class="null-p">The legal loli was about to fall into darkness, so Sayuki quickly changed the topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, enough about me. What about you, Tokihara-san?" "Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You want to become Kiryuu-kun's pet, right?" "Eh? Did I ever tell Ootori-san about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! ……Um… I just happened to overhear you and Kiryuu-kun talking before, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I guess I have to be more careful about that." "…Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, Koharu had known about Sayuki's fetish thanks to Keiki confiding in her quite some time ago, but Sayuki didn't know that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… there hasn't been any progress with the plan to make me his pet." "None at all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was the culture festival, and after that Keiki-kun has been busy with other things, so I haven't been able to approach him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The wall between you two might just get bigger, so is it really fine to just sit back and watch like that? Kiryuu-kun seems to be really popular, and us third-years don't have much more time…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">November was nearing its end, and once December rolled around, the year would soon come to an end. It was a short countdown from the end of entrance exams to their graduation. Sayuki only had a few months left as a third year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would be a lie if I said I wasn't panicking. All the girls from the calligraphy club are my rivals, and Fujimoto-san isn't the only one from the student council. Takasaki-san has also started showing interest in Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun sure has a lot of female acquaintances." "You can say that again."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_8.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">That was indeed the case. Almost to an unreasonably high level. Senpai and Kouhai, classmate and little sister… The sheer number of them was insane.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I really can't help that. Keiki-kun is really cool, after all. He might seem a bit unreliable at first, but he immediately goes and helps someone in trouble as best as he can. He's a truly wonderful man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I have to be even more of a bitch dog in order to get his attention."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, is that what you're on about? I thought you were talking about increasing your female charm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mean to brag, but aside from calligraphy and studying, I don't have many good points."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you want to become Kiryuu-kun's girlfriend?!" "Girlfriend?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's face turned red at the unexpected appearance of that word.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-How could I? Making me, a useless pig, his pet is all I can ask for." "That's not true. I think that you are a very charming girl, Tokihara-san." "Ootori-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll support you at least, Tokihara-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. All you need in life is a reliable friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm already supporting Nanjou-san and Mizuha-san as well, though." "Traitor!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't just choose like that. I like everyone, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu was a kind girl, so she was pretty close with both Mizuha and Mao already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki really is the harem king. So many girls like him." "Fufu, he might actually build a harem, that Kiryuu-kun." "He can't do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I want him to only have eyes for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">With those words, Sayuki buried her face into the pillow she was holding. While watching her, Koharu let out a faint smile. Wanting the boy you like yourself to like you back is a natural desire for a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">While Sayuki was busy revealing her heart of a maiden, Nagase Airi was enjoying the greatest evening of her entire life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, to think I would be able to have Yuika come to my own house!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She targeted the day where all of the second years would be out on the school trip, and made sure that her parents wouldn't be coming home for the day.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had set up a flawless plan to have Yuika come over for a sleepover.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She wouldn't take a bath with me because she was too embarrassed, but when I think that Yuika is currently taking a shower in my own bathroom, that's not too bad either…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After dinner, Airi tried to invite Yuika for a bath together, but her dream was quickly crushed. After finishing her bath all alone in sadness, Airi, with her hair down and wearing pyjamas, was currently setting out the guest futons.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's perfect!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sleeping area was perfectly prepared for Yuika's return, which happened right then with perfect timing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much for the bath." "Ah, welcome back."</p>
<p class="null-p">Needless to say, Koga Yuika was extremely cute. Her golden hair, her emerald-green eyes, everything about her was so beautiful that it made you sigh in appreciation. Even Airi was entranced by Yuika's looks. Not to mention that Yuika had just come out of the bath. The faint dampness on her hair, her slightly rosy cheeks, all of it toyed with Airi's sense of reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could I cop a feel of your breasts for just a little bit?" "Of course not."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following that immediate answer, Yuika pouted and hid her chest with both of her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sound like a perverted old man sometimes, Airi…" "Ehehe~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That wasn't meant as praise…" Yuika gave her walking-sexual-harrassment friend a harsh glare.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slowly afterwards, she put one hand on her mouth and let out a rather cute yawn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's late already, so how about we get to sleep?" Airi offered. "That sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can use the bed, Yuika. I'll sleep on the futon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika can't let you do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine," Airi said, "You're a guest today, Yuika." "…Then… how about we just sleep together…?" "………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, just how lucky could she be? She had been plenty happy with just the sleepover, and now that she was getting to sleep next to Yuika, she might just pass on in peace. A chance like this might never come again. Making sure to not give Yuika a chance to change her opinion, she snuggled into the bed next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It really is a bit narrow now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe you should sleep on the futon after all, Airi." "Ehehe, I don't wanna~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it was narrow, she could feel Yuika's body temperature, and that was enough bliss to make her forget about everything else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Yuika?" Airi asked. "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What made you interested in Kiryuu-senpai?" "Eh? What brought on that question?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Girl's talk is something you have to do during a sleepover, right?" "Girl's talk… Keiki-senpai is nothing more than a slave candidate." "Really? You don't have any romantic feelings for him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…N-None at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you hesitated for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because you said something weird! Keiki-senpai really is only a slave candidate!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Then let's leave it at that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that arrogant look on your face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi went a bit too far with her teasing, and Yuika puffed out her cheeks and pouted. That reaction was really cute, which made Airi want to see more, but Yuika might actually get angry at her in the process, so Airi decided to stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what about you, Airi?" "Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You hated Keiki-senpai in the beginning, but now you're actually pretty close to him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… Well, I don't really hate him, but it's a bit different from that." "Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I do think he's a good person, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she didn't want to admit it, Airi trusted Keiki quite a bit. Most likely, he was the best boy out of all of them. He was kind and easy to talk to, so she respected him. However, that wasn't anything like love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want to make him your slave, then you'd better hurry or he might be taken by someone else. He's pretty popular, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe he'll even get together with someone from the second-years during the school trip?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika is sure that something like that won't happen. Keiki-senpai is not</p>
<p class="null-p">that type of person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe, but aren't the other Senpais different?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's always the chance that some of the girls might approach him on their own…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way?! …Ah, but now that you mention it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed as if Yuika had an idea of who that might be already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto might not be as guilty, but Mao-senpai definitely is, and Mizuha- senpai already openly admitted that she likes Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, right. Mizuha-senpai is adopted, isn't she?"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_9.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">His interpersonal relationships were quite complicated. Not just second- years, but third-years seemed to be aiming for him as well. He certainly wasn't a manwhore, but he was no doubt a playboy at times, even if unintentionally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, it's Keiki-senpai's freedom to choose whomever he wants. Yuika doesn't mind at all. Even if it's not him, there are still as many people out there wanting to be Yuika's slave as there are stars in the sky."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No," With an expression as if she was close to breaking out in tears, Yuika laid bare her true feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wants Keiki-senpai to choose her." "Yuika…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her appearance was so cute that Airi had to embrace her. "A-Airi…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If I'm reborn, I want to become Keiki-senpai." "Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't because she loved Yuika by any means. It was just that the young maiden Yuika was too lovable, which made her feel jealous of the person who had managed to cause such an expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking the yukata-clad Mao with him, Keiki bought two cans of hot chocolate from the vending machine at the rest area on the second floor and handed one to her. The two of them sat down on chairs, and after they each took a sip, Mao was the first one to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did you want to talk about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to clear up everything that happened over the day." "I'm not angry about that anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha was the one who put the panties in there, right? She told me." "Exactly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you still haven't cleared my doubts about you being a smell fetishist."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I can't help it if you doubt me there. I had some special circumstances with Fujimoto-san that I can't really explain fully, but I definitely am not a smell fetishist."</p>
<p class="null-p">The smell fetishist was actually Ayano, but he couldn't exactly reveal that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm amazed you can call it a misunderstanding with those weak counterarguments."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I already know you'll probably got wrapped up in things like that again. If you accept my condition, I might believe you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What condition?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow night, we have this campfire, right?" "Ohh. We do, now that you mention it."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was written in the guidebook, and a lot of people had been talking about it over the course of the day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apparently, the applicants are going to dance cheek-to-cheek." "Ahh, in pairs, right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dance with me." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki looked at Mao in surprise, she had a pout on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Did you already make a promise with someone? Or do you not want to be my partner?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong on both… It's just… wasn't this event supposed to be for couples?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether it be couples, or pairs of people who more than friends but less than lovers, or just anyone aiming for a relationship, all the normies would dance at the campfire as music played. As if Mao understood what Keiki was thinking, she quickly spoke again with a slightly red face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't get the wrong idea, okay? If you dance with me, I won't have to worry about you dancing with some other girl, and then my doujinshi material won't suffer. There's no deeper meaning to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So that's why."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was always against Keiki spending time with other girls. Since that always resulted in her losing motivation to draw her BL series, she would always try to avoid Keiki getting romantically closer with other girls. That was also the reason why she had joined the calligraphy club. Though it would cause weird rumours if he danced with Mao, Keiki was already thought of as a harem king, so one more rumour couldn't hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'll dance with you." "It's a promise, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What meaning was there behind how the girl held her hands to her cheeks in happiness as she quickly separated from him? Keiki had no idea, and he continued to have no idea for the entire rest of the first night of the school trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">Daifugō or Daihinmin is a Japanese card game for three or more players played with a standard 52-card pack. The objective of the game is to get rid of all the cards one has as fast as possible by playing progressively stronger cards than those of the previous player. The winner is called the daifugō (the grand millionaire), earning various advantages in the next round, and the person in last place is called the daihinmin (the extreme needy). Common Western titles for the game include "President", "Rich Man Poor Man", "Scum", "Asshole", or "Capitalism".</p>

<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: Why are you here, Heroine?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to the first day of the school trip, the second was calmer and much more peaceful. After they woke up, they ate breakfast in the inn cafeteria, did some hiking in the mountains, and once it got close to lunchtime at around 12:30, it was time for some glorious lunch, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like I ate too much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lunch was an outdoor barbeque, and after they broke up into the same six groups again and enjoyed their meat and vegetables, Keiki had to sit down on the bench to take a break. His stomach felt close to exploding. He rubbed his belly to soothe the pain and watched the other students enjoying their own barbeque. Megumi approached him, her beautiful hair swaying with every movement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not eat anymore, Kiryuu-shi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm taking a quick break. Nanjou kept putting more on my plate…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, she also did me in. Nanjou-chan is almost like a mom, isn't she?" Letting out a giggle, Megumi sat down on the bench beside Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">She sat at a distance that was neither too far away nor too close to him. As an aside, she was wearing pants today, which gave her a bit of a boyish look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Today's the campfire, isn't it?" Megumi said. "Yeah, they're doing it around here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's even a dance going on. Are you planning on dancing with anyone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I promised to do it with Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? With Nanjou-chan? Did you ask her for the dance, Kiryuu-shi?" "No, Nanjou did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, so Nanjou-chan did. That's a bit unexpected." After hearing that, a grin flashed across Megumi's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why are you looking at me like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing at all.~ I just heard an interesting story from the manga research club.~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of story?" "The thing is-"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to keep this story a secret, she leaned towards Keiki, whispering into his ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-The boys and girls who dance together on this trip have a high possibility of staying together forever, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, is that so," Keiki responded with a monotone voice. "Huh? That's not quite the reaction I expected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm sure that this sort of thing would be interesting for people who were actually a couple. I, on the other hand, have lived my entire life without a girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So all hope is lost, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san, you can be quite frank if you want to, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">As an aside, Megumi was also open to applicants anytime, herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even if you don't have any interest in that sort of thing, Kiryuu-shi, that</p>
<p class="null-p">might not be true for Nanjou-chan." "Huh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, don't be so dense. If Nanjou-chan knows about this rumor, and she invited you to the dance, doesn't it mean that she's interested in you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki's thoughts came to a screeching halt. "…That's a thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you think about it, it makes perfect sense." "Seriously…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">According to Megumi, couples who danced at the campfire had a high chance of being together forever. There was also the superstition he had heard about pink panties increasing your chances of success during a confession, so Keiki wasn't exactly new to this sort of thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">So Nanjou invited me because she knew about that rumour? But… she herself told me that it was just to gather material for her doujinshi…</p>
<p class="null-p">She had said that it was a safety measure so that no other girl could have the chance to ask Keiki for the dance. It was so she wouldn't lose any more doujinshi material. Her only reason to act was her passion for her BL manga, so she could keep drawing Keiki in love with another man. Thus, there shouldn't be any sort of romantic affection for Keiki at play here.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what he thought, but was that really the case? Was that really the only reason she had invited him to this dance? Megumi's question "Doesn't that mean that she's interested in you?" kept bouncing around inside his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From how I see it, Nanjou-chan is the type of person who offers her everything to the person she likes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can totally recommend her as a wife, so if you're aiming for her, you'd better not let her escape."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm not aiming for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi seemed a bit too keen on getting the two of them together. It might just be his imagination, so he decided to ignore her for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I still think that having someone to dance with is pretty nice," Megumi said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does that mean that you don't have anybody, Onizuka-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… That's right! All the people in the manga research club flatter me and call me the 'Otasa Princess,' but the truth is that I've never had a single boyfriend my entire life. I'm a super anti-normie! Do you have any problems with that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">After catching a quick breath after that rather unfortunate reveal, Megumi directed her gaze towards their classmates who were still in the middle of enjoying their lunch. Far in the distance was a couple feeding each other some grilled meat. Megumi narrowed her eyebrows as she stared at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm really jealous. Being so lovey-dovey in front of other people." "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"All these stupid couples can just explode…" "Onizuka-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Just kidding~"</p>
<p class="null-p">After mixing some rather ominous words in there, Megumi stood up from the bench and acted like nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be going back now! Since I'm the aggressive type of woman, I have to</p>
<p class="null-p">get my meat, see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah… I'll be cheering you on…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He watched the predatory woman walk off into the distance, towards the battlefield called barbeque.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if Onizuka-san has some resentment towards couples like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki thought "Normies can go die in a fire" on occasion, but he felt that Megumi's emotion towards them was even stronger than his. Just then, Mao took Megumi's place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh. You're taking a break as well, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like that. What were you talking about with Onizuka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About a lot. But we reached the conclusion that all normies should, in fact, explode."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a bit beyond me, but okay." Who could blame her?</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Kiryuu, you remember our promise for tonight, right?" "About the cheek-to-cheek dance? Sure I do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good," With a cool tone, Mao turned her back to Keiki, giving him a glance over her shoulder. "You should come back soon as well, Kiryuu. The meat is gonna be gone otherwise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, and also-"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if she had remembered something, Mao turned around. With her hands</p>
<p class="null-p">behind her back, she flashed Keiki a teasing smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm looking forward to dancing with you tonight, Kiryuu!" "Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing that statement, which he couldn't tell if was teasing or not, Keiki could only gaze at her in awe as she returned to the barbeque space, clearly in a good mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That just now was unfair."</p>
<p class="null-p">With heart racing from Mao's surprise attack, Keiki remembered what Megumi had said. The rumour about a boy and a girl being together forever if they danced at the campfire. Did Mao know about it, after all? And if she did, did this mean she actually had feelings for Keiki, as Megumi seemed to think?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, no. This is just going to be some kind of perverted scam, nothing more."</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time Keiki got his hopes up like this, it always ended up twisted in some kind of perverted way. Even as he feverishly denied it, his face grew hot. Probably from the heat of the barbeque.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, evening came. Keiki was loafing around with Shouma on the sofa in the lobby. Outdoors, teachers and students alike were busily preparing the campfire, and other students also gathered in the lobby waiting for this event to start. In the middle of the commotion, Shouma let out a long sigh and gazed up at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a campfire happening, and I can't be with Koharu-chan." "We're in different years, so you can't help it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you said you're going to dance with Mao-chan?" "Yeah, that's what I promised."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shame. I was planning on dancing with you since Koharu-chan isn't here." "Nanjou is the only person who'd be happy about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">While the two boys were exchanging idle talk, Keiki's smartphone in his pocket vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it's Mizuha. What's she want now… Hmm?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened the message, a single picture was on the screen. Shown there was Mizuha in grey underwear-Or rather, wearing nothing but said grey underwear. Beneath the picture was a small line of text.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I found a great stripping spot, so I'll be doing a commemorative strip show here~'</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is she doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While the older brother's face was still frozen in shock, another message came in, as if she was watching his reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I'd be happy if you watched me live?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'If you don't hurry, I'll have to take everything off, you know.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"How are you so fast?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The dangerous messages from his little sister wouldn't stop. "Keiki? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something urgent came up!" "Eh, what about the campfire?" "You go on ahead!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With phone in hand, Keiki jumped up from his seat and dashed out of the lobby.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You damned exibitionist…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wouldn't end well if someone saw her like this. He had to force Mizuha to put on real clothes before things escalated. The place Mizuha said she was at was a bit away from the inn's main building. It looked like some unused storage room. After checking that the door was unlocked, he stormed inside the open room, which was about the size of a classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nii-san. So you came."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he walked past shelves of cardboard boxes, Mizuha was there waiting for him, still wearing the same attire as in the picture she had sent. Nearby were the clothes she had probably just been wearing, neatly folded into a pile. She gazed at Keiki. Her cheeks were already a bit flushed. She was most likely feeling slightly embarrassed because of her exibitionist play.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you remember this? It's the underwear you picked out for me, Nii-san." "Yeah, there's no way I could forget that."</p>
<p class="null-p">No wonder Keiki felt like he remembered that underwear. Keiki had picked it out for Mizuha during their date over summer break.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehehe, Nii-san saw my lucky underwear…" "You're the one flaunting it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should we do now? Should I strip myself? Or will you help me, Nii- san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so fixated on stripping in the first place?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Stripping off her clothes seemed as natural as breathing for Keiki's little sister. She already seemed aroused from only wearing a bra and panties. If</p>
<p class="null-p">she became naked right then and there, who knows what she might do?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how much you like this exibtionistic stuff, there has to be a limit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehehe, this is my way of seducing you." "Seducing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that you were planning on dancing with Mao-chan at the campfire tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that was my plan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to dance with you as well." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want Nii-san to also dance with me there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting one hand on her chest, Mizuha repeated herself with a serious expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You called me all the way out here just to tell me that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't expect Nii-san to actually dance with someone, and I don't want you to hold back anymore just because I'm your little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I wanted to declare my intent to you." "Declare what intent?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want Nii-san to only be mine." "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inviting a member of the opposite sex you're interested in to a dance around</p>
<p class="null-p">a campfire is a perfectly normal way to show everyone around you that they belong to you. Not to mention the aforementioned superstition about the dance. For a maiden in love, a reaction like this could be expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Meaning, if you don't follow my request, I'll be forced to do something irreversible here. I'm prepared for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you planning on doing?!" "What do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha put her left hand on the center of her bra and her right hand between her panties and skin. Both hands were on standby. She could reveal everything by just moving her hands a little bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Nii-san. If you don't want your little sister to end up naked, you'll promise to dance with her instead!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not seduction, that's just a threat!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, he couldn't allow his little sister to go completely naked. However, accepting this proposition would be akin to giving in to terrorism. Worst case scenario, Mizuha might use this technique for future negotiations.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha is definitely going too far today.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't accept exibitionistic behavior like this. Just her going to school without wearing panties had been gradually chipping away at Keiki's mental health. If she went completely naked in public, it would push him over the edge.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is the time to start the 'Negative Example' operation! It's now or never!</p>
<p class="null-p">This operation seemed to have had quite an effect against Ayano. If Keiki became a pervert here, he might be able to show Mizuha what it felt like to be tormented by an exibitionist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, here goes nothing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? N-Nii-san? What are you…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Who could blame Mizuha for her shock? Her own older brother suddenly started taking off his jacket and shirt. His entire upper body in full view already, Keiki put his hands on his pants and pulled them off in one fluid motion. He was now a pervert, standing there in only his trunks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now burn this image into your eyes!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had almost revealed his everything to his little sister. There was nobody on the planet who would refrain from calling him a pervert. However, Mizuha showed no signs of repenting on her actions, and her expression was the complete opposite of what he had imagined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, you're getting more and more into the mood, huh?" "…Mmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression suddenly turned into one of anticipation, and she started fidgeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was planning on this if the dance went well, but I'm perfectly fine doing it in this order, too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, it looked like Keiki stripping had the exact opposite effect than he intended.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted my first time to be on a bed, but this isn't that bad, either." "Eh, um… Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really prepared myself today, so I'm perfectly ready for everything." "What are you on about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki was completely lost as to what was going on, he understood perfectly well that Mizuha was saying weird things.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? You wanted to have sex with me, and that's why you stripped, right?" Mizuha asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This place is an inn with hot springs, and I thought that Nii-san might also get in the mood, so I tried a lot of things. It seems like it worked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lot of things… So that nurse outfit, the panties in my backpack, and that skirt-flipping was all for this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I wanted to get you as horny as possible.~" "How could this happen…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">All these events were nothing more than part of her plan to get her older brother as aroused as possible. Keiki's little sister was practically a sexual predator.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Nii-san? Will you do some nice things with your cute little sister?" "What is thiiiis?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had forgotten since she had been so calm as of recently, but Mizuha was actually quite sexually active. Even though he felt danger all over his body, he wouldn't be able to run away wearing just a single pair of trunks. He'd have to transfer schools if a bystander saw them right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, Nii-san… I can't hold back anymore… My body is getting really hot…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With moist eyes, Mizuha gazed up at Keiki, bringing chaos to his thoughts. "Nii-saaaan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha jumped at him without any warning. On top of that, she rubbed her soft, lovely cheek against his. Normally, this level of skinship would be something Keiki could handle, but right now, they were both in their underwear, and only their underwear. No outside observer would doubt that these two people were a couple right before having sex.</p>
<p class="null-p">This crazy soft feeling on my stomach is…?!</p>
<p class="null-p">He already knew that Mizuha was quite well-endowed, but feeling them up close like this was too overwhelming. For any other boy, this would have been the final strike to make them fall. And although Keiki was not like any other boy, if things kept going like this, he'd soon be consumed by Mizuha. Just when he started mentally preparing himself to finally graduate from his virginity-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki noticed that Mizuha's behaviour was weird. No matter how much time passed, she didn't try to progress any further than their current hug. She had been so proactive only a few moments ago, but now she wasn't moving an inch. She was just leaning against her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">No response came, and her eyes were tightly shut. On top of that, her breathing sounded a bit ragged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…? Hey, Mizuha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no response. Panicking, Keiki held Mizuha's body and put his hand to her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Scorching."</p>
<p class="null-p">The heat emitting from her was so hot that it almost hurt his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside a guest room on the inn's third floor. A futon was laid out on the floor, and Mizuha was lying down on top, wearing pyjamas. Her eyes were closed, and the girl seemed to be in pain, her reddened cheeks testifying to her high body temperature.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She does have a fever, but she should be better soon after taking that medicine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting next to Keiki on the futon was Tachibana Kaori-sensei. She was the 28-year-old school nurse who had a boyfriend younger than her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for imposing this much, Tachibana-sensei."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This much I can allow. An Onii-chan who wants to watch over his sick little sister is cuter than anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki hurriedly dressed Mizuha and contacted Shouma, who went to get the nurse. With Tachibana-sensei's permission, Keiki carried Mizuha up to the third floor, but they couldn't risk the other students catching the cold, so they went into an empty room. There, Keiki asked to be able to stay with Mizuha and nurse her back to health. Entrance on the third floor was prohibited for boys, but Tachibana-sensei gave him permission because of the emergency.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You probably already know this, but you can't enter any other rooms up here, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't be leaving Mizuha's side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll let the people from the inn know, so if things calm down a bit, you go take a bath if you want, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'll be going back to my own room now. If something happens, come let me know immediately, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a gentle smile, Kaori stepped out of the room. After seeing her off, Keiki directed his gaze back to Mizuha, who spoke up in apology.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It's not your fault you got a fever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you promised to dance with Mao-chan, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just emailed her and let her know. I'll make up for it another time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, the campfire dance outside must be in full swing. Though he felt bad for not being able to participate, Mizuha's health was definitely more important.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it's no wonder she'd catch a cold after all this exibistionistc stuff she's been doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back on it, she had been constantly subjecting her body to freezing temperatures. Yet another reason why Keiki hoped she'd finally stop with all her exibitionistic actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, how are you feeling?" "…My head is throbbing like crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because of the fever, no doubt. If only I could take your place…" "You really are a siscon, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">A faint smile appeared on Mizuha's face as they bantered like usual. "…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to take a shower…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No shower for you. That'll cause your fever to go up." "But the sweat is making me feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll wipe your body down, so make do with that for now, okay?" "…Okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">It must be tough for a clean freak like Mizuha, but she had to hold off on cleaning herself for now because of the fever. Keiki wanted to help her be as comfortable as possible, though, so he prepared some hot water and a towel to wipe off her sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'm ready. Take off your pyjamas." "Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Still sitting on top of the futon, Mizuha slowly lifted her upper body. After sitting upright, she turned her back to her older brother, opening button after button on her pyjamas, baring her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had caught a cold countless times before. Since the two of them were by themselves at home most of the time, they always wiped away each others' sweat if they were unable to take a normal bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">I've never thought much about it before now…</p>
<p class="null-p">So, why was he overthinking it now? Her slender, girly shoulders, her pale, sweat-drenched skin… All of it made Keiki see her as a member of the opposite sex. He was entranced by the sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, sorry. It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't the time to be spacing out like that. Mizuha was sick right now. He just had to wipe off the sweat before her body cooled down any further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, here I go." "Please do."</p>
<p class="null-p">After drenching the towel in hot water, he softly ran it across Mizuha's back.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_10.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Auu… That tickles, Nii-san." "Please put up with it for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl in front of him wasn't in good shape right now, so he had to be careful. Thankfully it didn't take too long, since it was just her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, we're done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, thank you." After thanking Keiki, Mizuha continued in a slightly teasing tone. "Are you not going to do the front?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do the front yourself." "Okaaaay."</p>
<p class="null-p">After accepting the towel Keiki offered her, Mizuha wiped down the front of her body. It took her a bit longer than usual, most likely due to her condition. After she was done, she let out a satisfied sigh. She wanted to button her pyjamas again, but she had trouble moving her fingers because of the fever, so Keiki helped her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This should be good." "Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem. Lay down and get some rest now, okay?" "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha must have had trouble just keeping her body upright. After she laid down again, she let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Until I fall asleep… will you hold my hand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever Mizuha caught a cold, she always started acting like a clingy child. After Keiki assented, she seemed to relax.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Make sure to sleep a lot so that you're in good shape tomorrow." "Mmm… I don't really want to sleep yet…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I stay awake forever, I can keep holding your hand like this." "Just go to sleep, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaaay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After giving a rather childish response, Mizuha closed her eyes for good this time. It didn't take too long for soft breaths to start escaping her mouth, an indication that she had fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Good night, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Making sure to be gentle so that she wouldn't wake up, Keiki softly stroked her on the head. His beloved little sister's face while she was sleeping looked like that of an angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't know how much time passed after Mizuha fell asleep. When he checked the clock, the hour hand had already moved past midnight. It was long past the time that lights were supposed to be turned off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll take a bath before going to bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had wanted to watch over Mizuha as long as possible, but if he didn't sleep soon himself, the following morning would be very tough to live through. He snuck into his own room on the second floor, making sure to be quiet so that he didn't wake Shouma. He quickly gathered his toiletries and</p>
<p class="null-p">moved down to the first floor. He took off his clothes in the completely empty changing room, put a towel around his waist, and entered the bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">After washing his body thoroughly, he headed out to the open-air bath. He sunk down up to his shoulders in the steaming hot water, feeling all the exhaustion washing away from his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I could get used to this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a bath with friends while talking was quite fun, but enjoying the silence while taking a bath alone wasn't too bad, either. Though it was close to December, and the mountains were rather cold during the night, enjoying a hot bath like this was something you had to do at least once.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was enjoying the open-air bath- "………Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He heard a rattling sound, and the door connecting to the changing area softly opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, someone else is here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was well past time for lights-out. Since the school had reserved the entire inn for themselves, this shouldn't be any other visitors, either. That would mean that this was a male student or teacher who loved taking baths a bit too much, or someone working at the inn itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, all of his assumptions turned out to be wrong. The person who appeared in the open-air bath was a girl he knew. She had her usual reddish- brown sidetail in a bun off to one side and a towel wrapped around her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yo."</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl… had entered the men's bath out of her own free will. The calm and</p>
<p class="null-p">relaxing atmosphere from before changed immediately. Even though she had come here herself, she still seemed to be a bit embarrassed, and she held the towel around her chest and waist while she fidgeted nervously. It was quite a cute sight, not to mention enjoyable, but Keiki couldn't afford the time to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You… Don't you know that this is the men's bath?! What are you doing here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I know, but I happened to see you heading to the bath, so I thought I might as well join you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing?! What will you do if someone else comes in here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It should be fine. I put up a sign at the entrance that says it's currently being cleaned."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You impudent little…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone's asleep, alright, so it's no big deal, right? I'm coming in now. It's cold out here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? ………Hold on?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without waiting for a response, Mao slowly slid her slender body deep into the hot water. And, as if it was completely natural, she sat down right next to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaah, this feels really good…" "Y-Yes, I agree…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Subconsciously, Keiki found himself switching to using polite language. Because he was taken by complete surprise, his head was in absolute chaos.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this? Why is Nanjou taking a bath with me?</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting in the same bath with a female classmate was way too surreal. Since it</p>
<p class="null-p">was already past midnight, all the students and teachers should already be fast asleep, but he didn't understand why she would come to the men's bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Don't stare too much. I'm wearing a towel, but I'm practically naked." "Isn't it bad manners to enter the bath while still wearing a towel…?" "Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be quite a bit more troublesome for Keiki if she didn't have the towel with her. Since it was in the middle of the night, he couldn't see too clearly, but there were enough small lights around that he could see the important parts. If he so much as glanced to the side, he would be able to see her open cleavage, as the towel didn't cover up much. Keiki couldn't relax in the slightest with a girl like Nanjou next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I already told you before, but this is the man's bath, you know? Just why did you come here? What's your goal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like there's an actual goal or anything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me that you were going to observe my naked body to gather some material?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, that sounds pretty good to me." "Nanjou-san, you pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you an idiot or something? Well, I can't exactly deny the accusation." "So you're not going to bother trying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I wasn't a bit perverted, I wouldn't be drawing BL manga." "That makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an understandable reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. How is Mizuha doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She still has a fever, but she should be fine after some sleep." "I see…" Mao let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_11.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">She knew about Mizuha's condition, so she was a bit worried. "…Um, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry that I couldn't keep our promise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't sweat it. Your little sister collapsed, so of course you couldn't just ignore her and go dance."</p>
<p class="null-p">After making sure that Mizuha was in safe hands, Keiki had contacted Mao to tell her about the situation. He had apologized over email that he wouldn't be able to make it to the dance, and she responded in a kind way like she was doing now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was still pretty fun even if I couldn't dance. You don't often get to see big campfires like that, after all. Though Akiyama and Onizuka were all busy cursing the dancing couples."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I really wanted to dance with a certain someone, though." "O-Ohh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"All I could do was watch the campfire in silence, so I was pretty lonely." "I'm sorry, okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, I'm just joking. I'm not angry at all." "Are you sure about that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been angry almost the entire trip, so he couldn't exactly trust that statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll definitely make up for it another time," Keiki said with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really don't have to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I will. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to forgive myself." "Kiryuu, you really are obstinate about the weirdest things."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she looked a bit fed up, there was a glimmer of genuine happiness in Mao's smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about it? Should we dance right now?" "Dance… right here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why not? Nobody's here, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but wasn't that just supposed to be a warning for the other girls?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't want to lose any possible BL material, so she couldn't allow Keiki to go out with anyone who wasn't male. That was Nanjou Mao's story, and she had repeated it several times already. Thus, if there were no girls around to see them dancing, the entire reason for them dancing in the first place would be gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really have a reason, but… do you not want to dance with me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said that with a rather sad expression on her face, nobody in Keiki's position would have been able to tell her no.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. Let's dance, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">As the girl had said, the open-air bath was currently reserved for the two of them. He didn't have to worry about someone else making fun of him for his horrible dancing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but make sure you've got a towel on, okay?" "Of course!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when he had turned into an exibitionistic pervert earlier, he had protected his underwear like his life depended on it. He didn't want to be accused of revealing his naked crotch to girls, so he hurriedly fastened a towel securely around his waist. The two of them stood up and faced each other, clad in nothing but towels.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't stare too much, okay…?" Mao fidgeted a bit. "You're saying that now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's start…" "Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They took each other's hands, and the dance started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit hard to move, isn't it?" Keiki commented. "We're in the middle of the bath right now, after all." "Should our steps align here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just dance along, that's fine.~"</p>
<p class="null-p">While exchanging a few words, the two of them matched their steps as they danced. Unlike at the campfire, there was no stage or music to accompany them. In addition, the two of them had close to no experience, so it must have been quite an awkward dance to watch. But even so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are we doing this late at night? Haha." "You can say that again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's pretty fun." "Yeah, I agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">When you thought about it calmly, dancing with a girl beneath the starry sky was quite a surreal event. But he didn't hate this mysterious feeling. He</p>
<p class="null-p">danced with Mao awkwardly, watching her enjoy herself. His heartbeat turned all fluffy, as if he was in pure bliss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wasn't that pretty good for our first dance?" "No way in hell."</p>
<p class="null-p">When they finished their dance, they separated from each other and had a short exchange.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that felt good. I was feeling all gloomy up until now." "Gloomy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were flirting around with Mizuha and the vice president on the first day, right? I was trying my best to get closer to you, but you were always just going off and hanging out with other girls, so of course I'd get frustrated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that phrase like it was nothing, but it hit Keiki in the chest like a bullet. But before he could clarify the meaning behind those words, Mao pressed him even further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you already know this, but I have the most fun in life while drawing my BL books. Being able to just do what you enjoy doing is the best luxury you can have."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I enjoy myself just as much when I'm with you, Kiryuu." "Does that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about you?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you… think about me, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the same question Shouma had asked him the night before. Nanjou Mao was a person Keiki could rely on in times of trouble, who always gave her all for the things she loved. She was a bit harsh at times, but she always kind, and that gap made her incredibly cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's a bit hard to say, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying things like this aloud was a bit embarrassing. However, he figured that running away here would mean that he wasn't a man, so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that your towel is about to fall down, Nanjou." "Eh…?" Mao's eyes spun at Keiki's unexpected answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had to have been because of the dancing, but the towel protecting her naked body had started to look quite loose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"~~~?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally realizing the situation she was in, Mao's face turned bright red in a matter of seconds. As she held her towel with one hand-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say that sooner!"</p>
<p class="null-p">-She pushed the boy's chest with her other hand. "-Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a surprised voice, Keiki fell backwards, landing on his butt. "Ah, sorry… Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao stepped forward to help him up, but her feet tangled with Keiki's, and she lost her balance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a result, Mao fell to the ground as well, landing right on top of Keiki. Unfortunately, her towel was lost in the progress, and their bodies were now directly contacting each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki froze in place, unable to move a muscle. At the same time, Mao's own body was glued to his. And they were both naked. Mao's two well-endowed bulges were pressing directly against Keiki's chest, and he directly felt their volume, softness, and warmth.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is… really bad…!</p>
<p class="null-p">This stimulus was enough to completely ruin Keiki's ability to think. Or in other words, he was getting more than just nervous. His most precious member was starting to go into battle formation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou! Sorry, but please get up immediately!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to get so angry, I'll get up right awa-Hm?" "Hauuu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mao moved her hand to separate from Keiki, the tragedy happened. "…Eh? What is this weird… sensation…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling a foreign sensation in her hand, the girl furrowed her eyebrows. She had a good grip on a hard, rod-shaped object in her right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's my son you're holding there!!</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's towel must have been sent flying from the impact, as well. As a result, his male genitalia was now touching Mao's hand. On top of that, the girl showed no intention of releasing her grip, but rather she kept moving it up and down, tightening her grip in order to figure out what exactly she was holding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nyauuuu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what? What's with that weird voice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Experiencing stimulus at his weakest point, Keiki couldn't hold back a shriek. When this happened, Mao finally realized exactly what she was grabbing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? Don't tell me… this is Kiryuu's-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">100 points. She was holding the almost perfectly-erect male symbol with her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, you're kidding right?! Wait, it's growing? No, more importantly, I'm currently… Kiryuu's…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's brain couldn't comprehend what was happening right now. Jumping away from Keiki at the speed of a bullet, she quickly grabbed a nearby towel and covered her front, her face redder than ever before. With a wary gaze, Mao carefully glanced over at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What are you doing?" She asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a perfectly normal reaction that a normal boy like me cannot influence, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? …So that means you were getting excited because of me?" "Well… that's what it boils down to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… Sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's not that big of a deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's Kiryuu… I don't really hate it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What… do you mean by that…?" Keiki was perplexed by Mao's sudden profound line.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Mao was wrestling with her own set of problems.</p>
<p class="null-p">What am I saying?! That's basically the same as saying that I like him!</p>
<p class="null-p">With these thoughts going through Mao's mind, her inner turmoil soon turned to panic. In the middle of all of this, she arrived at a single conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing I can do here is confess! This is the perfect chance! Say it! Just say it!</p>
<p class="null-p">She decided that she should confess right here. Since she couldn't retract her words, saying 'I love you' was a far better option. She felt like she might be able to muster up the courage now, so she took a step towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I… I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting one hand on her chest to tightly grip the towel, she turned towards the boy she had feelings for and vented all her bottled-up feelings for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I… really love Kiryuu's d*ck!"</p>
<p class="null-p">…And she completely messed it up. Her once-in-a-lifetime chance, something she had to get right no matter what, turned into that. It was a confession of love mixed with admiration of his d*ck. Because of what had just happened, the only thing she could think about during her confession was Keiki's son, and those two feelings had jumbled into one, which caused her to say something bizarre instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">I totally messed it uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's attempt at confession failed spectacularly. Saying 'I love your d*ck~' that boldly would make her nothing more than a perverted bitch. Naturally,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's reaction was as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nanjou…? What are you talking about…?" "Well, I'll be going now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's head was a complete mess, and she didn't have any confidence that she could clear up the misunderstanding. All she could do was run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhh, I really went and blew it!!!</p>
<p class="null-p">It was around ten minutes after the tragedy. Mao had wrapped herself in the blanket of her futon inside a four-person room on the second floor, and she was agonizing over what had happened. When she saw Mizuha and Ayano attacking Keiki consecutively during this field trip, Mao realized that she was the one who was lagging behind the most. All these girls had something she didn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the aggressive attitude to do whatever it took to achieve their goals. Sayuki, Yuika, and even Mizuha were all actively pursuing Keiki, while Mao's passes were sorely lacking. Thus, she had decided to try her own hand at seduction.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had woken up late at night and gone out to the bathroom. She had spotted Keiki coming out of Mizuha's room, and she knew that he would most likely head over to the men's bath, so she decided to confront him there. All hell would have broken loose if she was caught by a teacher, but a maiden in love wouldn't be scared by that sort of thing. Eventually, she pushed herself enough to actually muster up the courage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything had gone smoothly while they were dancing in the open-air bath, but she messed up big time at the very end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu probably thinks that I'm a d*ck-loving bitch now…</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was most likely the first person who had touch Keiki like this. In a certain sense, she was one step ahead of her rivals.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did want to move our relationship forward, but not in that sense, okay?!</p>
<p class="null-p">She had never wanted this kind of development. If she had the power to turn back time, this was the moment she would really want to use it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kiryuu's… was actually pretty robust…</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back to the strange sensation in her hand, Mao's cheeks started to burn red again. The first male penis she had ever touched was one that was moving towards full battle mode. Though it might have been a bit lacking in stiffness, since it wasn't completely erect, it still showed that Keiki had been aroused by Mao's body-</p>
<p class="null-p">"~~~?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao started kicking her legs up and down in embarrassment, and she was scolded by a sleepy Megumi next to her. "Shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I can't sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was after 1 AM. Rolling around in his futon in his room on the 2nd floor, Keiki grumbled in agony. Who could blame him after what had happened in the bath with Mao? Shouma was sound asleep with a bright grin on his face in the futon next to Keiki, and Keiki could guess what dream he was having, considering the constant murmuring of phrases like "Koharu-chan, I love ya…" coming from that direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">The room's lights were turned off, but a new source of light appeared in the form of Keiki's phone screen turning on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… at a time like this? …Wait, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he raised his body to check the screen, he saw that he had a new message from Ayano, saying 'Are you awake?' For a second, Keiki thought</p>
<p class="null-p">that this must be another perverted thing that he'd get wrapped up in, but he couldn't imagine her trying something like that this late at night. It might even be another emergency. He decided to respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I am. What's wrong?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'I want to talk to you about something. Can you spare some time for me?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Alright. Where should we meet?'</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short amount of time passed, he received a response. 'Then let's meet in the waiting area on the third floor,' to which he swiftly agreed. Putting on a brown coat over his yukata, he quietly stepped out of the room, making sure not to wake the sleeping Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">It really seemed like everyone was asleep, and not a single sound could be heard inside the inn. When he made his way to the veranda at the meeting place Ayano had spoken of, she greeted him, wearing similar clothing as Keiki was. They stepped out onto the veranda together and were greeted by a beautiful winter sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry to call for you this late at night." "It's fine. I couldn't sleep, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad you were still awake. There's something I had to tell you no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?" Ayano nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a favor to ask of you, Kiryuu-kun. I want you to support me during the next student council election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You want me to support you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't quite the favor that Keiki had imagined. He didn't even know that there was going to be an election in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? But wasn't it already decided that you would become the new student council president? I thought that Takasaki-senpai said something to that effect."</p>
<p class="null-p">He remembered her mentioning that the Momosawa High School student council president would always pick the next one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have other candidates this year, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's why."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that she mentioned it, Keiki remembered that Shiho had added an "If there are no other candidates" back then. That meant that there were other people who wanted to become the student council president this year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So when is the election?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will be announced next week on Monday. The voting happens on Friday." "Eh? That's so soon!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I was planning on telling you about this earlier…" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki oddly enough understood the reason for that pretty well. Considering that he had chosen the calligraphy club over the student council a while back, she must have been hesitant about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You need five people to back you so you can register as a candidate. Currently, we just have the current members of the student council as well as Mitani-kun's predecessor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that makes four people. But I think that you might be able to find someone better than me to be your supporter."</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto Ayano was fairly popular. She had excellent grades and was always willing to help people. There must have been a lot of people who would</p>
<p class="null-p">gladly support her. However, Ayano shook her head in response to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want anybody except for Kiryuu-kun to help me. This might be selfish of me, but you're the person I trust the most."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had never regretted choosing the calligraphy club back then. But he did want to remain on the student council as well…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. I'll help you out until the election is over." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I did promise to help you out whenever you need it." "Thank you," Ayano gave him a relieved smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw that, the dots started to connect in Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, so the important thing you wanted to talk about on the first day was this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously? I totally thought you wanted my underwear again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I was going to do that, I would have requested the one you'd been wearing all day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that sure sounds like you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For once, Keiki actually felt bad jumping the gun there. Still, just when he was thinking that, Ayano suddenly put both her hands inside the hem of her yukata. A moment later, she pulled her panties off in one fluid motion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing now?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm taking off my panties?" "But why though?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seemed like you were getting aroused by the smell of a girl before, so I thought that I'd help you out as thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it, I forgot to clear up that misunderstanding!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of his negative example operation on the first day, the girl still believed that Keiki was a smell fetishist. It was true that he had sniffed her thoroughly and asked for her panties, but that was all part of the 'De- perversion' plan he had thought of. Said plan was supposed to consist of him behaving like each perverted girl in an attempt to cure them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why are all the girls around me trying so hard to give me their panties?!</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, Keiki quickly explained his actions back then and had her put the panties back on again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's better than being turned into Pervert Mask…" He muttered. "Pervert Mask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing, nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was referring to the nightmare he had seen a few days ago. "Let's get back on topic. About the student council elections."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he thought that Ayano would just succeed Shiho as the student council president, someone else had gotten in the way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And who is this other candidate you were talking about?" "That's-"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person Ayano mentioned was all too familiar to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's who it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's pretty unexpected. I didn't really think they were the type of person to do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But they seem to be serious about it. Naturally, I don't plan on losing either," The girl spoke with determination. "We definitely cannot let them win."</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the final morning of the school trip, and the bus drove along the streets towards the school. Mao was sitting in a seat in the back, sound asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She fell asleep the second the bus started moving, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She looks so cool and collected normally, but her face is so charming and cute when she's sleeping~"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the seat next to her, Megumi softly poked her slender fingers at the sleeping princess Mao's cheeks. Since she didn't even wake up after all that, she must have really been sleepy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apparently she didn't sleep all night," Megumi said "I see…" Keiki replied dismissively.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for that could only be the tragedy at the open-air bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it wasn't fully erect, she still grabbed it when it was going into battle mode…</p>
<p class="null-p">It wouldn't be weird for someone to have PTSD from an accident like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, the seats in the bus were distributed into their respective groups again, so Keiki and Shouma were seated next to Mao and Megumi. Many of the students aside from Mao were also sound asleep. They must</p>
<p class="null-p">have also worn themselves out during the school trip. Just like Mao, Keiki's lolicon friend had also lost against the seductive strength of sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akiyama-shi is out cold, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He was talking with his girlfriend on the phone until late at night." "The rumoured legal loli Senpai, right? I'm so jealous of them being so</p>
<p class="null-p">lovey-dovey." Grinning at Shouma, Megumi yet again voiced her jealousy of couples.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Keiki intensely looked her over. "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a small-statured girl with fluffy long hair. Though she had baggy eyes, she always had a gentle expression on her face, and she was also quite a beauty, with a calm atmosphere around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-shi? Why are you staring at me like that?" The girl quickly noticed Keiki's gaze, and continued. "…Ah?! Did you actually fall for me after all the talking we did?! I'm honored, but I actually have someone I've sworn my heart to-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Megumi was close to having a drastic misunderstanding, Keiki quickly denied her assumptions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what is it?" "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, he hesitated, but there was no real need to hide it either. He would feel bad if he woke the other two up, so he lowered his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san, is it true that you registered as a candidate for the student council president election?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi's expression turned into surprise, though only for a moment, but her usual smile quickly returned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you hear that from Fujimoto-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? …Well, it's not like I care. I'm serious about becoming the student council president. Once we get home, I'm going to immediately start preparations for the election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Last night, the person Ayano had said was the other candidate was indeed Onizuka Megumi. Now, the person herself admitted her plans.</p>
<p class="null-p">But why did Fujimoto-san say that we can't let Onizuka-san win…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto Ayano wasn't the type of person who say things like that without a reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san, why do you want to become the student council president?" "Do I not look like the type of person who'd be good at it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures. I know that myself. But there's something I have to do no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I become student council president, I will prohibit any couples on the school grounds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It took a moment for Keiki to wrap his mind around what she was saying. While her classmate was at a loss for words, the smile on Megumi's face disappeared, and she stared at him with cold eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm planning on banning romantic relationships from our school."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: You are the Student Council Vice President, and I am your Butler</p>
<p class="null-p">The school trip came to an end, and it was the very first monday of December. Mizuha recovered quickly from her cold. After enjoying Mizuha's delicious breakfast, Keiki headed to school a bit earlier than usual. When he arrived at school, he headed straight to the student council office. After knocking on the door he had entered through countless times as a provisional student council member, he entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">He greeted everyone there. Four student council members were present, seated around the long table. The beige-colored twintail girl Airi Nagase tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, who might you be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You already forgot about me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I'm just joking. Good morning, Kiryuu-senpai," Airi laughed with a gentle smile as she greeted him.</p>
<p class="null-p">She turned her head to look at Ayano next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like you successfully managed to get Kiryuu-senpai on board, Ayano-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, I managed to get him."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said 'get him' in a flustered way, and judging from her reaction, Keiki figured that there was probably a double meaning in there. While he was busy thinking about it, Shiho called out to him from her chairman's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you have a seat, Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. That's right," Nodding along, he headed to the seat across from Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">The student council secretary, Mitani Rin, flashed a smile from next to him. Since he was currently wearing the male uniform, he was to be addressed as 'Rintarou,' not 'Rinko.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Keikun-senpai. I'm happy to be able to work together like this again. Why don't you just come back to the student council for real?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a nice idea," Shiho said. "Ayano-san also agrees with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, but I'm just here because I was invited," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after Shiho and Ayano voiced their agreement with Rintarou's proposition, Keiki politely declined. After the culture festival, he had chosen the calligraphy club over the student council. He wasn't going to change his mind on a whim after all that, and he was only here because of a friend's request.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for coming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did promise to help, didn't I?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano gently smiled in response. After their greetings were done, Shiho spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Time is running short, so let's start. Airi-chan, if you would." "Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Answering with a calm voice, Airi got up from her seat and stood in front of the whiteboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I'd like to start our student council election operation meeting. I, Nagase Airi, will take part as the facilitator."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nagase-san is almost too suited for this role, isn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She might be suited to work as a secretary for a private company." "For now, let's start by going over the information we have."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi spoke louder in response to the quiet whispers of the two boys.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The announcement of the selection, as well as the presentation of the candidates happens today after school. The election period runs from today until this Friday, five days in total. The voting as well as tallying the votes will happen on Friday, as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">While she explained, she wrote the schedule on the board with neat handwriting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And as for the aforementioned candidates, our student council's vice president Ayano-senpai will be running for student council president."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing her name called, Ayano stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Fujimoto Ayano and I will be running for the position of the student council president. I will try my hardest so that I will be elected, so please watch over me."</p>
<p class="null-p">After voicing her ambition, the girl bowed slightly towards the other people present and sat down again. Airi continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And as for the candidate that Ayano-senpai will be competing against-"</p>
<p class="null-p">While she spoke, Airi put a picture of the other candidate on the board. "Onizuka Megumi-san, currently in class 2B, and one of Kiryuu-senpai's classmates."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki returned Airi's gaze with a nod. She had indeed been in his group during the school trip, but he didn't have any crucial information about her that he could share here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"According to documents we've received, Onizuka-senpai promises, if elected, to prohibit all romantic relationships on school grounds."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had heard that directly from Megumi already, as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you knew her objectives already, Fujimoto-san?" Keiki asked. "A while ago, she sent me a declaration of war."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A declaration of war…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So it wasn't just his imagination that Ayano had been rather wary of Megumi during the school trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing short of rash to challenge the current vice president. Ayano- senpai is rather popular, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san might have some sort of hidden ace in the hole though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki agreed with Airi's opinion, but there was no doubt that Megumi was indeed serious. Megumi herself knew that she wouldn't win based on popularity alone, so she might have some hidden plan that would turn the election in her favor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why would Onizuka-san want to ban romantic relationships like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi was supposedly a normal student, and a member of the manga research club. Now she was suddenly trying to become the student council president. There must be a reason for this sudden change in aspiration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, you're against her campaign pledge, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want everyone to be able to enjoy their student life here. Studying and clubs are important, no doubt, but romantic relationships with the person you love are also an important part of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I wholeheartedly agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wanted to get a cute girlfriend and enjoy his youth. Keiki certainly wasn't alone in this. Every male student at their school held the same wish, most likely. Even among the female students, there were certainly a lot of people who wanted to experience love. There was no way that Keiki could allow someone to change the school rules and ruin everyone's dreams like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"On a personal level, I'm not against the ban on romantic relationships. That would save the poor girls from the hungry predators called boys who run around the school, sinking their poisonous teeth into hapless victims," Airi said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I expected you to say that, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, that aside, I think Ayano-senpai is more suited to be the student council president."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou nodded in response to Airi's words. "I also don't like people who force their values on others. On top of that, if this ban goes through, I won't be able to go out with any of the big-breasted Onee-san's in this school, and that'd be awful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou, you should hide your desires a bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief… this is why Mitani is so…" Airi glared at him like she was looking at trash on the side of the road.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki had to mentally agree with his opinion that big breasts are great.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's ignore Mitani for now… This is what the current situation looks like. That should be enough, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, this should be okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Treasurer Airi spoke to Council President Shiho, who nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's not much time until the announcement, so we gathered here early in the morning, but the general time of operations will be during lunch break and after classes have ended. I'll give you the schedule later, Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what you would expect if the entire student council gathered. Everything was planned out to the smallest detail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright then, now we need to determine positions for everyone here as we prepare for the election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Positions for what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like the election campaign strategy director-general, or the PR manager. I think that Kiryuu-senpai is well-suited for any odd-job-related work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Odd jobs…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Mitani would be well-suited to be the horse of a horse-drawn carriage."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, so I'm not even a human anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Airi's poisonous tongue was stinging Rintarou quite hard, he still managed to keep up a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Ayano slowly raised her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want Kiryuu-kun to be my secretary." "Your secretary?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll stay at my side at all times, so I can recharge whenever I want." "I feel like there's some ulterior personal motives in there?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, a secretary shouldn't be there simply as a constant supply of smell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds fine to me. Ayano-senpai will be fighting in the front lines of the election, so something to raise her motivation might be a good idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keikun-senpai has a lot of responsibility now~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, you have to show your manhood here, okay?" "All of you are enjoying this, aren't you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he found himself unable to decline, since Ayano had asked him directly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I'll be your secretary, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, simply coming to the student council office like this was akin to volunteering to help Ayano however he could. No matter the job, all he had to do was push Ayano closer towards the office of student council president.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they decided on the different positions that everyone in the Fujimoto party would take.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was Ayano's executive secretary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was the election campaign strategy director-general. Rintarou was the PR and general affairs director.</p>
<p class="null-p">And finally, Shiho somehow ended up being the 'Leader of Support'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shiho-senpai has to prepare for her entrance exams and all that. Generally, she won't be able to help out much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's happening pretty soon, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry that I can't help out too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, the previous secretary was busy with his own entrance exams, so they decided to just use his name as a backer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, are the election posters already done?" Keiki asked. "Yep, everything is already prepared. Want to see?" Ayano said. "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no need for election last year, and he had never seen an election poster with someone he knew on it. Since Ayano had done it all on her own PC, the rest of the group crowded around in front of the screen. Ayano was sitting in her chair, and the others peeked around her at the desktop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit embarrassing, though." "Let me see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano opened the file with the poster she had created. "… "</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the group saw it, they all went silent. The person on the desktop in front of them was without a doubt the current student council vice president Fujimoto Ayano, and she was, as always, a beauty above beauties, with one eye hidden behind her bangs. Yeah, she was undoubtedly a beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">She really was, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san's expression is absolutely blank…" Ayano had a completely straight face in the picture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayanon-senpai, this is a bit…" Rintarou's expression grew cloudy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, there's definitely a smile missing here…" Shiho had a wry smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that the advertising slogan says 'Create smiles together with Fujimoto Ayano', but she's not smiling at all." Airi dealt the final blow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano hung her head at the harsh criticism. "I tried my best to come up with a good slogan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The slogan is fine, it's just the picture that's the problem, right?" Keiki offered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he felt bad for Ayano, as her secretary, he definitely couldn't okay this poster design. Meaning-</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have to take a new one."</p>
<p class="null-p">They decided to exchange the current picture on the poster for a new one.</p>
<p class="null-p">The meeting ended, and Keiki was about to leave with everyone else when Shiho called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, do you have a moment?" "Ah, yes. I do."</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, morning homeroom was about to start, so he didn't have much time at his disposal. Shiho herself seemed to be aware of that, as she continued talking while she stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for all of this. Helping with the election and such."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. I agree that Fujimoto-san is a better candidate for the student council president, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had excellent grades and was always willing to help people in need. The teachers trusted her quite a lot, and Airi and Rin looked up to her. On top of that, Keiki knew from his work as a provisional student council member just how much she loved every single student in this school, as well as the school itself. Because she had this charm, he wanted to help her as much as he could.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are a good kid, Keiki-kun. Let Onee-san give you a reward." "Eh? …Wah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho suddenly stretched out both her hands and wrapped them around Keiki's head, pulling him directly into her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Takasaki-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When his cheek hit something soft, his heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll leave Ayano-chan to you, okay? I can't really help all that much this time, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_12.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">When she told him that with a soft voice, Keiki realized something. She wouldn't be able to participate in the activities because she was so busy with her entrance exams. That's what Airi had said, and she had given Shiho the title 'Leader of Support', keeping it rather vague. That must have been because Shiho really wanted to help out, but wasn't able to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, leave Fujimoto-san to me." "I'm counting on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">After releasing her Kouhai, Shiho flashed a smile like a blooming flower. "Well, I do think that Ayano-chan will be fine even without my worrying." "Ahaha, I can see that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, and also…" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was there any sort of development with Ayano-chan or the girls from the calligraphy club during your school trip? Over the past few days, I haven't been able to stop fantasizing about you doing something with them and cheating on me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing happened that would make Senpai happy, no." "Ehhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't look so satisfied about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">This student council president wanted to be NTR'd. She was happy with both doing the NTRing or being NTR'd herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you end up getting together with Ayano-chan during this election, let me know, okay? Stealing Ayano-chan's Secretary-kun has a nice immoral feeling to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just want kind of confession would that even be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't know how to answer after being slapped in the face with such overt sexuality. It might be a good idea to take away any political power from this pervert as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">As of right now, Kiryuu Keiki had two problems that he had to worry about.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of them was the fast-approaching student council election, with Onizuka Megumi as their adversary.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other one was the fallout from the accident that had happened in the open-air bath during the field trip. Basically, Mao was completely avoiding him. If he tried to approach her, she would just immediately run away, and if he tried making eye contact, she would try to avoid his gaze. The reason for that was without a doubt her declaration that she loved d*cks.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew that she was passionate about BL, but I didn't think that she was this serious about it…</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that judging from Mao's reaction, Keiki's own son down there seemed to be quite good. Even after looking it up to check if his size was something to be happy or sad about, he was still torn between the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma must have been worried about Keiki and Mao, because he called out to Keiki as soon as second period ended.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that you guys made up? It seems like it suddenly got worse, huh?" "Well, we aren't exactly fighting this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you let me hear you out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the offer, but for Nanjou's sake I think I'll hold off on that for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, what happened…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma must have been very intrigued at this, but backing down when he</p>
<p class="null-p">was about to cross a line was one of his good parts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll just have to not think about Nanjou for now, and focus on the election." "Fujimoto-san and Onizuka-san are going up against each other, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it'll be announced after classes today," Keiki answered, and his gaze wandered over to Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gleefully talking with the other girls from class, she certainly didn't look like someone who wanted to ban romantic relationships. However, he couldn't just relax because of how she looked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, I'll be borrowing Koharu-senpai during lunch break." "Koharu-chan? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had already sent her a message immediately after that morning's student council meeting and had arranged a meeting with her. Her strength was necessary in order for them to win the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">Later, during lunch break, after Keiki ate the delicious lunch box that his little sister Mizuha made, he met up with Ayano, who had also finished her lunch. The two of them headed to the third floor of the club room building and made their way to the astronomy club room. Ootori Koharu, the club representative, met them there. Their upperclassman was wearing a hoodie over her uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So that's why you came to ask for help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's nobody around here who could hope to win against you in a battle of camera skill, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was a rather abrupt request, she still accepted it without complaint. Good posters are necessary for a good election campaign, so Keiki decided to seek the help of the former stalker. Ayano agreed to it, since leaving it to Koharu rather than an amateur like Keiki was a good idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's not much time, so let's get started right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two Kouhais bowed to their respected Senpai, who showed a kind smile as she started directing Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, please stand over there." "I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly, the place she had Ayano stand looked like a genuine scene from a professional photoshoot. It felt like they could have some secret gravure idol photo sessions here and nobody would know. Naturally, the club budget wasn't nearly enough to do that, but considering that Koharu was the rich daughter of a famous construction company, money was the least of her problems.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I built this for a photoshoot with Shouma-kun, but I'm glad we can use it for this, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai, you're surprisingly active, contrary to your looks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever the reason, Keiki was really grateful for this. The equipment she used was of high quality, and her skill was nothing to scoff at. All she had to do was take a beautiful picture of a smiling Ayano, and the poster would be complete.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, the subject this time around is really cute. It's totally firing me up." "Now you sound like an old man…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright then, please look over here~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, under Koharu's guidance, the photoshoot started. Ayano stood in front of the completely white panel, and the camera shutter clicked several times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu separated her slender body from the camera with a slight groan. From the sidelines, Keiki could tell from her expression that she wasn't quite</p>
<p class="null-p">satisfied yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, your expression is a bit stiff…" "Was it… no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It wasn't bad by any means, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your expression might have looked a bit cold, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu…" Ayano lowered her head. "When there's a camera pointed at me, I just turn a bit stiff and nervous…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I can understand that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano never had a huge variety of facial expressions, so to speak. Naturally, if you just talked to her normally, she would flash an occasional smile, and her teasing expression was exceptionally cute as well. Even her neutral expression like this was cute. They needed a good picture to use for the poster, though. There was no need to elaborate on why a smile would be better than an expressionless face for their marketing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san," Koharu said. "Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You like making sweets, right?" "I do, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there anything you're especially good at making?" "Um… apple pie?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apple pie, huh? Sounds great. Then imagine that you just made the best apple pie ever, and you're giving it as a present to someone you like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Someone I like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anybody is fine, you know? Your family, friends, or even the person you have feelings for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The person starts eating this apple pie and smiles at you, saying it was delicious. That makes you happy, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">A change started to occur in Ayano's expression, probably just from imagining that scene. The tension seemed to disappear from her body, and she seemed to be calmer and more relaxed. As if on cue, the camera shutter went off again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for that wonderful expression~" "Eh, when did you…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she realized that she had been played, Ayano let out a voice of surprise. This was Koharu's real skill: not missing the best shot when it happens.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_13.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. It seems like it was a success." "That's Koharu-senpai for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">At times like these, it was really showed that she was a reliable upperclassman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, who did you imagine just now, Fujimoto-san?" "I-It's embarrassing, so I can't say!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sight of Ayano acting embarrassed was truly adorable, so Keiki burned the sight into his eyes as he enjoyed it to the fullest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I'll have someone I know print out the posters. I'll make sure that they make it in time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you so much for everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the photoshoot ended, Keiki and Ayano left the astronomy club room behind them. They could have used the printer in the clubroom as well, but because it was so important, Koharu offered to have it done by a professional. They felt very indebted to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'll have to repay her somehow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll make some delicious apple pie for her," Ayano said. "That sounds great. Your apple pie is crazy good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, the one you made before was really delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Then I'll make some for you as well, Kiryuu-kun," Ayano said happily as they walked along.</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu would no doubt be happy to get a pie from Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The posters are taken care of thanks to Senpai, so now we just have to focus on the announcement after classes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if right now, the preparations were moving along smoothly. They still had to hang up posters on the school bulletin boards, come up with the speech, and many more things, but it should all be fine at their current pace. With these thoughts in mind, Keiki and Ayano headed down to the first floor of the club room building. There they ran into Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Kiryuu-shi and Fujimoto-chan?" "Onizuka-san? What brings you here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We had a short briefing in the manga research club room. They're all helping me out with the election, see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was only for a high school student council, fighting in an election alone would no doubt be pretty difficult. There was also the rule that you needed at least five backers, and just like Ayano had people back her from the student council, Megumi must have her own support from the manga research club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you with Fujimoto-chan, Kiryuu-shi?" "I'll be her secretary during this election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That explains it. You were a provisional member for the student council before, too, weren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't anything odd about a previous provisional member helping out the current vice president. Suddenly, Ayano, who had kept quiet all this time, stepped in front of Keiki and looked straight at Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I definitely will not lose."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmph, you never know until the votes are counted."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though they were polite about it, there were definitely sparks flying between the two. Their ambitions might be different, but both of them were working their hardest for the position of student council president. For their own beliefs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, let's fight fair and square."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that declaration, Megumi headed to the classroom building. As Ayano watched her walk away, Ayano's eyes had a faint sadness in them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Onizuka-san looked like she was in pain." "In pain?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that Onizuka-san is wavering as well. If she has some sort of special circumstances, or something that isn't allowing her to enjoy the school fully, I want to help her in any way I can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This sudden kindness towards the enemy right after a declaration of war took Keiki a bit by surprise. Of course, some would say that Ayano was too soft to take a leadership role like student council president. However, this very attribute of hers was what made Keiki help her, was what made him think that she and nobody else was worthy of being the student council president.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gently, he rubbed the student council presidential candidate's head. "Then we definitely have to win the election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'll try my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Megumi had said, they were going to fight fair and square.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just after classes ended, it was officially announced that the student council president election was going to be held. All across the entrance of the building, and through the school itself, the news about it scattered. There was even a school-intercom broadcast about it, and the news spread like wildfire.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of that, Keiki and the others started moving. Though there wasn't much time, since the vote would take place on Friday, all the student council members worked to the best of their abilities. Even though they lacked manpower, all of their work was done right on time, and that alone testified to their skill. Since they were used to this sort of work on a normal daily basis, all the preparations went through as smoothly as could be.</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially under the influence of Airi, whose work as the election campaign tactician was excellent. She was even able to direct her Senpais like a commander on the frontlines.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around then minutes ago, Airi had told Keiki to hang up flyers wherever he could. After he was chased out of the student council office with these 'Ayano posters' in hand, he was now doing his work on the second floor of the school building. Shouma was with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to have you help out here, Shouma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, it's no trouble at all," Shouman replied while pressing thumbtacks through a poster into a bulletin board.</p>
<p class="null-p">Doing this kind of job may have seemed simple, but there was quite an overwhelming number of posters in the first place, so he had asked Shouma for help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd be quite troubled if Onizuka-san wins, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You wouldn't be able to flirt with Koharu-senpai at school anymore, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. Though I don't think that we have to worry that much. I feel bad for Onizuka-san, but Fujimoto-san's reputation and good evaluation is tough to beat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I can't see Ayano losing, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot of students held Ayano in high esteem, all because of the hard work she had done for them. It might sound a bit harsh, but an ordinary candidate like Megumi shouldn't stand a chance. Not to mention that her campaign promise was to prohibit romantic relationships at school. There was no way that the majority of normal high school students would be on board with that. Nobody was going to say it out loud, but most of the students were already thinking "This won't even be a battle," as they watched this election.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, Koharu-senpai's work is really a sight to behold."</p>
<p class="null-p">After pinning a poster on a bulletin board, Keiki gave it a closer look. Her slogan was still 'Create smiles together with Fujimoto Ayano', but the background picture was way better than before. That smile alone would definitely guarantee her countless votes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Fujimoto-san and the others are handing out flyers outside." "Ah, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing next to Shouma and gazing out the window, he spotted them, just as</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma had mentioned. Even Airi and Rinko were helping. "I see. Now I understand why I'm doing the poster job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Most people would rather take flyers from cute girls, after all." "One of them isn't a girl, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">In Rinko's case, his looks might well attract some female fans, so Keiki stored that knowledge in the back of his mind for the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's so cold outside, but they sure are working hard." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano was fighting for the sake of the students' smiles. Keiki, too, wanted to work as best as he could.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's do our best as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just watching Ayano gave Keiki more motivation, and returned to his own job. As they continued to work on putting up the posters in silence, they spotted a different group doing the same thing on a bulletin board in the extracurricular classroom building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like the people from the manga research club are also putting posters up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure looks like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">According to the information they had received from the election tactics chief Airi, the manga research club had four members, Megumi included. Just as she had mentioned before, there seemed to only be boys in said club except for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megu-chan, I finished hanging them all up over here!" "Megu-shi, Megu-shi, I'm done here as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megu-senpai… I-I finished it as well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">One had a tall stature, natural curly hair, and bangs so long that you couldn't see his eyes: Inooka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Another one had a slim figure and was wearing glasses: Shikagawa. Finally, there was a rather small-looking, docile boy: Chouno.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Inooka was a third-year, Shikagawa a second-year, and Chouno a first-year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much. Then let's move on to the next location!" "Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Flashing a confident smile to the group of three, Megumi started walking away, and the others followed after her. From the way she acted, she really</p>
<p class="null-p">did seem like a princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like Onizuka-san is doing some good work over there, as well." "Yeah, her way of hanging up the posters was quite refined."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inooka and the others were enjoying themselves as they put up the election posters. From the looks of it, her other club members held her in quite high esteem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, Keiki. I've been wondering about something for a while." "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't Tokihara-senpai over there, glaring at us?" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he where Shouma pointed, he spotted the black-haired beauty hiding half of her body as she gazed around a corner, staring at them. When their gaze met, she quickly pulled her head back, only to immediately poke out with it again, making it more than obvious that she was watching them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What is she doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe she has some business with you? I'm done putting up the posters here, so you don't have to worry about me. I'll go on ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, thanks for helping out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thanked him, and Shouma flashed a bright smile and walked away. "…Now then."</p>
<p class="null-p">His friend was nice enough to give him some time. Keiki raised his voice as he walked down the hallway towards the individual who was spying on them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, Keiki-kun. What a coincidence to run into you here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You peeking on me the entire time doesn't count as a coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cold. Even after we haven't seen each other for days," Sayuki spoke with a pout as she stepped out from the corner.</p>
<p class="null-p">He hadn't seen them a few days during the school trip, but her breasts were as big as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what were you really doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you didn't come to the clubroom all this time, I was going around the school and looking for you. Then I saw you hanging up Fujimoto-san's election posters. The school trip is over, but just when I thought I'd finally get to see you again, you're off helping with the student council. I've been feeling terribly lonely while waiting for my master to return, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that explains the resentful glare."</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't matter much, but Keiki at least respected her for being able to blurt out so many words without stuttering once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you at least contact us once in a while?" "I'm sorry, I forgot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such cruel treatment?! …Ah, but, that feels like you're abandoning me, which isn't too bad, either…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not get aroused over every little thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was already going hardcore masochist just a few seconds into their conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why are you helping in the election?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because Fujimoto-san asked me for help. I'll be working as her secretary until the election is over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Secretary, you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki offered a short explanation, Sayuki reacted to the word 'Secretary'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A secretary like someone who's often found with company presidents or politicians?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being with them 24/7, staying at their master's side, supporting them in their work, delivering coffee, and offering their bodies to them at night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not the last one. But the other ones, pretty much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was aware that her description mostly matched what he was doing. After he nodded in agreement, Sayuki puffed out her cheeks in protest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfair! If I can get Keiki-kun as my secretary, I'll participate in the election, too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you even know what you're saying? Third year students can't participate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Here was a third year high school girl who felt frustrated about the fact that she couldn't run for student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But haven't you already cut your ties with the student council?" Sayuki asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't just ignore Fujimoto-san when she asks for help." "Hmph…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I won't be able to come to the club for the next few days." "…I understand. Do as you please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, you gave up pretty easily."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had expected a bit more resistance from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't like having Keiki-kun taken from me, but considering that campaign promise…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The full names and campaign promises had already been published, and Sayuki had heard about them, from the sound of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If romantic relationships are forbidden, then so are any illicit relationships as well, right? That means I won't be able to do this and that with Keiki-kun anymore at school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly were you planning on doing on school grounds, Sayuki- senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's way too embarrassing to say out loud…" "I figured as much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then should I show it to you live in the club room?" "I kindly refuse."</p>
<p class="null-p">He figured that he'd lose something precious to him if he agreed to come along. Also, illicit relationships were already prohibited.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I think it's better to not let down your guard. I just saw Onizuka-san and her followers, and they were doing good work. She might turn out to be a tough opponent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She has quite an ability to use the men around her to achieve her own goals. Fujimoto-san could learn from her arrogance a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san is not that type of person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But becoming the student council president means becoming the leader, right? She has to keep her subordinates together, and a bit of selfishness never hurt anybody."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the current student council president Takasaki Shiho had moments when she was more aggressive. In a sense, this showed that Megumi had the potential to be a leader.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That goes for Keiki-kun as well. If you don't use all the women you have at your disposal, your title as harem king will lose its meaning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds perfectly fine to me, to be honest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means you're fine with me being your only pet? I'm so happy!" "Just how optimistic can you be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If possible, he wanted to learn a bit from her impressive mental fortitude. "Anyway, you just go and give Fujimoto-san the support she needs." "Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if you don't stop by sometime, I might just look for another potential</p>
<p class="null-p">master, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By all means, go ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How cruel?! You have to show at least a bit of concern, okay?! That was my strongest heart-throbbing line!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot! Keiki-kun, you idiot! I'll definitely go look for another master!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Throwing 'idiot' after 'idiot' after Keiki, the young lady Sayuki screamed as she started to tear up. Her shoulders jolting up and down out of anger, she</p>
<p class="null-p">stomped down the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai sure is fierce today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must be frustrated since Keiki hadn't spent much time with her as of recently. Even so, not bothering him during the election must be her own way of thinking about her future student life, or at least the rest she had. It's not like he wanted to try out weird SM roleplay with Sayuki or anything like that, but prohibiting any sort of boy-girl relationship was too strict in his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki would flatly refuse having the collar of banned romantic relationships being placed around his neck. Not if he could help it.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the second day of election week, during lunch break on Tuesday. Since he was a library committee member, and it was his turn to man the library, Keiki was sitting at the library's counter, dealing with any patrons. After receiving permission from the school's head librarian, Keiki was allowed to hang up Ayano posters on the bulletin board in the back. And sitting next to Keiki was Koga Yuika, kicking her legs up and down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Keiki-senpai?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it true that you're Fujimoto-senpai's secretary?" "Yeah, she asked me to help her out during the election." "…Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, are you gloomy about that?" "Not really~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so she said, but she was pouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thought that you didn't want to be her slave, but you immediately agreed to be that girl's secretary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm only going to be her secretary until the end of the election." "Keiki-senpai, you pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've been staring at Yuika's thighs this entire time." "I was found out?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's furtive glances over at Yuika's legs had been found out. Because of how she was kicking her legs up and down, the skin between her skirt and knee-socks was revealed, and he couldn't help but stare at it. If there is eros, a man's eye will follow. That is how human beings work. While her upperclassman panicked from being found out, Yuika flashed an energetic grin as she gazed at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're that interested, Yuika wouldn't mind kneading your back with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't look at them because I wanted to be stepped on…" "Hmph, you're not honest at all~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that was an honest comment from the bottom of my heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">He really wished she wouldn't make him out to be a pervert asking for punishment. He was just leisurely enjoying a girl's thighs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, setting your thigh fetish aside…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Try and find someone who doesn't like thighs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We didn't have an election last year, did we? Why do we need to have one this year?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, normally the current student council president decides on their successor, and the plan was for Fujimoto-san to take over for Takasaki- senpai, but this time Onizuki-san also applied as a candidate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why," Yuika nodded in understanding. She might be interested in the election, herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone in Yuika's class is talking about the election. Though everyone thinks that Fujimoto-senpai might be the better choice, Onizuka-san is also quite beautiful, so some of the boys have swayed over to her side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't want to say this, but the first impression of a candidate can be an important factor that influences the election."</p>
<p class="null-p">This seemed to be the case this time around as well. Though it didn't revolve solely around their looks, since both candidates were quite beautiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, who are you planning on voting for, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Keiki-senpai becomes Yuika's slave, then she'll vote for Fujimoto- senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is an important vote, but I can't exactly put my life on the line like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're dissatisfied with that offer, then how about you receive Yuika's vote and a piece of this?" she said. She slowly lifted up the hem of her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her thighs came into plain view. Just a bit more, and her panties would be visible.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_14.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Wah?! What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a special service for Keiki-senpai. You made a face just now like you really wanted to see some panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of face is that?! I didn't think about panties for one second!" "But Yuika is wearing some really cute ones today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just put your skirt back down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch." Yuika clicked her tongue and obeyed. They then returned back to the original topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Yuika knows the vice president more anyway, and she doesn't like the idea of having someone forcefully ban her from romantic relationships, so she'll be voting for Fujimoto-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's opinion seemed to be the same as Sayuki's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But there do seem to be people supporting Onizuka-senpai," Yuika said "Well, it's not like everyone has the same opinion," Keiki admitted. "Right. Boys are also split up into the types who like big or small breasts." "Why did you use that example now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika just thinks that all big-breasted girls should share with the poor~" "You sure are saying some scary stuff with a pure smile…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki judged that it would be better for all parties involved if he quickly changed the topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, I have something to ask you, Yuika-chan." "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was wondering if I could leave the club work after classes today to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oho, so you're pushing all your work on Yuika while you go rendezvous with another girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not always assume the worst?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But there's absolutely no benefit to Yuika, right?" "What is your wish, my lady?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How far are you willing to go? Can Yuika include some candle wax roleplay in there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sadly not. Please keep it in a reasonable level." "Then maybe treat Yuika to a parfait sometime." "Well, if that's all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the contract was bound. One parfait in order for her to help out was a small price to pay.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Oh, if it isn't Kiryuu-kun." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki lifted his head when someone suddenly called his name. The person who greeted him was a male student standing at the counter who had a bit of a glare in his eyes. His smooth and dry bangs were split right down the middle, and he had quite good-looking features. He was carrying a compact tube-shaped pencil case and workbooks, so he was probably planning on studying in the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it your turn on the library committee? Good work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, yes. Thank you…" Forcing a friendly smile, Keiki responded a bit stiffly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even with his glare, this student looked like quite the soothing person to talk to. He directed his gaze towards Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see you two together a lot. Are you Kiryuu-kun's girlfriend, by chance?" "Oh no, not really…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, you don't have to be so humble here… Anyway, I guess I've bothered you enough, so I'll be studying now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. Take your time…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking the one-sided misunderstanding with him, the boy headed to a table far in the back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was he an acquaintance of yours, Keiki-senpai?" "It seems like it, but… who was it again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had talked to Keiki normally, but Keiki was a bit lost as to his identity. There was no mistaking that he was an acquaintance of his from the way he had talked to Keiki. He shouldn't be someone easy to forget, either, thanks to his looks and glare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…By the way, Senpai?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wonders if the two of us look like lovers~" "I-I wonder…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought they looked like nothing of the sort.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're actually not lovers, but master and slave, right?" Yuika prodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's also wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika softly laughed at Keiki's expected reply. But Keiki couldn't help wondering if something was wrong with this world for making such a cute girl a hardcore sadist.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes, Keiki was busy doing some paperwork in the student council office. At certain points, he would take a sip of coffee, calculate the cost of the election, sort vouchers. Just then, Airi and Ayano returned from handing out flyers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're back." "I'm so tired…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was the same always, but Ayano looked pretty exhausted. Keiki replied with an awkward "H-Hey…" since he had hardly ever seen her this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Fujimoto-san? You look really worn out." "I was doing a handshake session outside."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A what now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi took the lead and answered Keiki's question instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We had handed out almost all the flyers, so we figured we'd try a new approach."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's skills certainly weren't in talking with people face to face. That was why she had one eye hidden by her bangs. The handshake session must have really been tough for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san is really bad with this sort of thing, after all." "Yeah, I'm really spent…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as she said, she couldn't even put much strength into her words. She was like a salaryman close to retirement coming home after riding on a full train. Keiki felt pretty bad for her, so he directed his next question to their election campaigns tactician.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do we really have to push Fujimoto-san this much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I didn't want her to shake the hands of the filthy boys. But this is all to win the election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're like a fierce sergeant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who's a fierce sergeant?" Airi's twintails shook as she averted her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so Keiki thought, but she quickly returned to her original stance, letting out a faint giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the handshake session was quite a sensation, wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Fujimoto-san is really cute, after all. Any boy would be entranced if they were able to shake her hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Entranced…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reacting to that word, Ayano wordlessly walked over to Keiki. She suddenly took Keiki's hand into both of hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Kiryuu-kun entranced by this sort of thing, too?" "Ah, well… Probably?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was a bit lost as to what was going on, but the sight of her looking up at him as she asked that was too cute, so he suffered a defeat. A handshake session with a girl like her didn't sound too bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a favor to ask of you, as my secretary." "Ohh, fire away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you let Ayano-san charge herself up?" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki was able to respond, Ayano made her move. While Keiki was still sitting in his chair, Ayano moved forward and embraced him, rubbing her head against his chest as she breathed deeply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… Haaah… It's been so long… I'm coming back to life…" "Oh yeah, you haven't sniffed me at all recently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something is definitely wrong with you, Kiryuu-kun. You give off such a sweet-smelling scent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All that's weird is this situation and your fetish, Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Ayano was busy enjoying the situation, Airi turned a cold gaze towards the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu-senpai, you lecher."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It should be obvious that I haven't done anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouldn't you look a bit more happy, since you're being hugged by Ayano- senpai like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would someone sniffing my smell make me happy? …Ahh, Fujimoto- san? Could you maybe let go now? Nagase-san is giving me a scary glare here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess it can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki's request, he managed to have the perverted girl separate from him. Ayano's skin almost looked like it was sparkling thanks to the recharge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, the election takes priority. The handshake session was a big success, and I expected nothing less from Ayano-senpai. She's respected by a lot of people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There weren't any bold moves coming from the Onizuka faction, so we might actually be able to win at this rate."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as clear as day that Ayano, with good records and high popularity, would be able to win this. An election was, in the most simple sense, a battle of popularity, and the more people who knew your name, the higher your chance of victory was. A lot of people in the student body knew about vice president Ayano, and because of her kind personality, she had a stable amount of followers. Thus, everyone who was watching this election couldn't imagine someone like Onizuka coming out on top, though nobody dared speak it aloud.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, a big upset shortly followed. "-B-Big trouble!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The door swung wide open, and Rinko dashed into the student council office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with you, Rinko? If you keep rushing like that, someone will be able to see your underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't pay any attention to my panties right now!" "I mean, I really didn't in the first place…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, take a look at this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He seemed to be in quite a rush. Ignoring Keiki's reply, he slammed down a printed document on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this… The result of the approval rating investigation for the student council election?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The newspaper club put the data together. They gave this to me while I was handing out flyers!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… isn't this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… According to their data, Ayanon-senpai and Onizuka-senpai are currently neck to neck!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown in a graph was the aforementioned result of the investigation. According to it, Ayano had an approval rating of 55%. Against her was Megumi with 38%, while the other 7% didn't care either way. Looking at these numbers, Ayano was still winning, but the difference should have been greater, or at least everyone expected it to be. Everyone was now at a loss as to how Megumi had managed to get up to almost 40% approval rating without having an insane amount of backers like Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, these results showed that it wasn't time to relax yet. There was still a possibility that the situation could take a turn for the worst.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: Love, Elections and a Broken Heart</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since she started attending grade school, Megumi had been called 'Oniko1'. The family name Onizuka seemed to be rare, so she was often told things such as 'Oni-san, over here~' and so on. Thinking back on it, it wasn't a big deal or anything. It was just a rather special nickname that originated from her family name, but Megumi truly loathed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't choose this name because she wanted to, and she had no say in it, it just wasn't cute in the slightest. Thus, whenever she was called that, she would just reply by saying 'I'm not Oniko!', which a bad decision. Getting angry at the other girls back then was the exact reaction they were hoping for. Thus, eventually, Megumi stopped saying anything. Even if she was called Oniko, the child of a demon, she didn't say anything. And at that time, a prince appeared in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy had suddenly moved into her neighborhood, and he managed to make the boys mobbing Megumi stop before she had even noticed it. It wasn't that he was strong, but since he was one year older, his body was a bit taller and better built, that was all. Even so, he was nothing short of a hero to the young Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Calling you Oniko and all that is just really rude." These were the words he spoke after saving her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not a demon. You're more like like a princess, Megumi-chan." "A princess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I mean, you're really cute, after all." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the first time a boy had ever said those words to her. After saving her, he even called her a princess. She couldn't be happier. Tears she had never cried when she had been made fun of suddenly started streaming down her cheeks. In response, the boy got a rather troubled look on his face. It wasn't until a few years later when she finally realized that he had been her first love.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes had passed since Rinko had brought the result of the approval rating investigation into the student council room, and the room was now wrapped in a rather heavy atmosphere. The student council members surrounded the table, each and every one of them with a clouded expression. The election campaign tactician Airi finally broke the silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad. I never thought that Onizuka-senpai could gather so much support."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I never expected this kind of reaction for a not-well-known candidate…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also had thought that there would be a bigger difference between them." "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Rinko voiced similar opinions, and Ayano just stared at the paper in her hand in absolute silence. Megumi's approval rating was unbelievably high. She was currently 38%, and since this was only the second day of election week, she would surely make it past 40%. Something was clearly off for Ayano, the current vice president, to not have a bigger lead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Is there some kind of trick that she's doing we don't know of?</p>
<p class="null-p">What was the reason why Megumi would have so many supporters even though she wasn't a well-known candidate? If they could figure it out, they</p>
<p class="null-p">might come up with some sort of countermeasures for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, how much can we trust the newspaper club's investigation? What if there's an off-chance that the people they asked were mainly just Onizuka supporters?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't believe that's the case." "I don't think so, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Rinko and Airi rejected Keiki's hypothesis, and Airi gave her reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our newspaper club is constantly striving to only publish the most accurate of information. The reporters are all excellent. I believe that these numbers are highly accurate as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what if there are Onizuka-san supporters inside the newspaper club itself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no chance of that. The current club president hates the current state of media with how much they guess and try to influence, so he has a policy of always publishing the truth as it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That would mean that the club president wouldn't give in to money or other such bribery. Judging from that, this approval rating vote in front of them could be trusted. While Keiki was still pondering that, Rinko spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But then, how did Onizuka-senpai manage to get so many votes? Everybody seems like they'd be against prohibiting romantic relationships."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His opinion was the exact same question that Keiki had. Megumi had openly announced on her posters that she planned to ban romantic relationships.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why would all of the high school students in their prime of life agree with her? Falling in love with a wonderful member of the opposite sex, spending your time in happiness and bliss… The school life everyone had always</p>
<p class="null-p">admired would all go to waste at this rate. "What… What if it's the opposite?" Airi asked. "The opposite?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki voiced his confusion, Airi gently nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looking at it on the bigger scale, there's only a handful of couples who openly show it, right? Most of the students here are single and alone, and since they can't get a lover themselves, maybe they're trying to get in the way of those who have found happiness?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… So maybe it's resentment…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought that it was possible, since he resented couples, himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same for me, I guess. When I see couples openly flirting with each other, I sometimes wish they would just explode from their happiness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai, you're the worst…" "I'm only human."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when his friend Shouma and his girlfriend were flirty in front of him, there were times he would think 'Do that at home.' That's just how it is for someone who's bitter that they can't find the same happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you can't get a girlfriend yourself, you just wish that all the others would split up, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san's campaign pledge might be really resonating with the students who feel alone like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Rinko and Keiki thought about the idea even more. At the same time, Airi narrowed her eyebrows as if she had arrived at a difficult question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if we assume that's the case, it's still a difficult feat to get so many votes in such a short amount of time. She must be really good at</p>
<p class="null-p">understanding the desires of others."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she doesn't call herself the 'Otasa Princess' for nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew how unpopular boys felt, which made her an even stronger opponent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't treat this lightly, can we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The approval rating results were a harsh hit to the Ayano faction. Ayano was still winning as of now, but a huge turnaround was now something they had to be careful about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Either way, we have to come up with some countermeasures. Now more than ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">They decided to have a short break before the emergency countermeasures meeting. Keiki decided to step out of the student council room and get some sugar, so he headed to the nearest vending machine. He quickly inserted his change and keyed in his order. Though they also had coffee and tea in the student council room itself, he really wanted some from here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah?! …Ahh, it's just you, Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when he leaned over to take his out of the machine, someone behind him called his name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you also here to get some sugar?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No," Ayano shook her head. She opened her mouth and softly spoke. "I wanted to talk with Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she had followed him all the way out here, it must have been something she couldn't bring up in the student council office. Keiki didn't have the slightest guess as to what she would want to talk about, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano lowered her head in apology. "I'm sorry. I'm not very reliable, and I keep making trouble for you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki finally connected the dots.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you talking about the approval rating?" "………" With a long face, Ayano just nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thought about it, Ayano hadn't said anything the entire time they had been talking about it before. All of this talk about it must have been worrying her beyond belief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that Fujimoto-san did anything wrong. The other party is just stronger than we anticipated, but we still have the upper hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun…" Ayano slowly raised her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, her downcast expression quickly returned again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I wasn't able to say anything. While you all were talking about it… It just made me realize that I might not be a good match for student council president… and it might be why not everyone accepts me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If there hadn't been any election in the first place, this doubt might have never even come to light. A rival Megumi had appeared, she ended up getting compared to her, and it was making her doubt if she was really worthy of being student council president. The approval rating results ended up seeming like how people approved of her as a person, and she was projecting them onto herself. This sort of pressure couldn't be easy to deal with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that you can be a bit more headstrong and confident." "Headstrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai mentioned it to me before. That a leader can be a bit more pushy and arrogant. If you're bad at giving orders, then you can just leave that to Nagase-san. I'm sure that Rintarou would be more than happy to do chores and odd jobs, so there's no need for you to carry all the weight. Even Takasaki-senpai uses other people to help the job get done efficiently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And if you're still worried, then this election can help you see it for yourself. If you win against Onizuka-san, that just means that you're better suited to be the student council president, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki finished his words with a gentle smile, and Ayano was dumbfounded. That didn't last long, however. She chuckled with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that Kiryuu-kun is being a bit too simplistic."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, those were his honest feelings. From the bottom of his heart, Keiki believed that his student life, and the lives of the other students, would be even more fun if Ayano became the student council president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But thank you. I feel like I've broken through my doubts thanks to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come ask me for help whenever you're stuck. I'm your secretary right now, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I have a request…" "Oh, fire away."</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of answering, Ayano clung to Keiki instead. "Let me… recharge?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At a time like this? …Well, it's not like I mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having someone else sniffing you was a weird sensation, but if it helped give her energy, it should be fine to play along for a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, please give me your underwear if I win the election." "That's a no from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">That request he declined immediately, however.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had already determined everything that needed to happen during the election process. First, they had to put up the election posters to get Ayano's name out there. After that came her public image. Giving everyone a chance to see a candidate would naturally make everyone want to support her.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that sense, Airi's idea of holding a handshake session was very effective. Being able to shake hands with a cute girl like Ayano would make the boys happy. Some people were even willing to pay large amounts of money for handshake sessions with idols. After this information was brought up in the beginning of the countermeasures meeting-</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kids these days want is excitement and motivation! Something truly new!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The short break came to an end, and after all the members-excluding Shiho, who was busy-had taken their seats in the student council office, Rinko continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have to create something new with impact that will take back the votes from the Onizuka faction!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's quite a good idea considering that it's coming from Mitani…" "And what exactly are we going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'll have Ayanon-senpai dress as a man! Don't you think that's a great idea?!" He slammed his hand on the desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi and Keiki let out a disappointed sigh at the same time. Though all of the current members of the student council were excellent at their jobs, none of them had experienced an election like this before. Absolutely none of them had any know-how about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We really don't have any ideas about what to do about the approval rating…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Elections are pretty difficult."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki summed up their results briefly, and Ayano agreed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, is there really any need to panic like this?" Airi followed up as everyone's enthusiasm dampened. "We're still in the lead on the approval rating poll, and drastically changing our stance might just make matters worse. I also doubt that the anti-romantic-relationship faction will grow any further."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that those with boyfriends or girlfriends are rebelling against Onizuka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, the legal loli and her lolicon boyfriend were against the Onizuka faction, as well. They didn't want anyone to ruin their enjoyable time together. Thus, all of the couples in the school would definitely give Ayano their votes. On top of that, since she was quite popular already, Ayano had her other supporters, as well. It was more than obvious that Megumi was at a disadvantage on all fronts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means we can probably just keep going like we already are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Keikun-senpai. The other party managed to get a lot of support in such a limited amount of time. Don't you think that they might have some kind of hidden strategy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinko's argument was also very reasonable. Overconfidence was a slow and insidious killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to do anything I can." "Fujimoto-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the vice president said this, Keiki could only agree. As her secretary, he</p>
<p class="null-p">had to think of something new.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The problem is how we can appeal to the voters. I imagine that just making public speeches and all of that won't change much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might have an idea… How about we turn Ayanon-senpai into an idol?" "You want to turn her into an idol?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet again, Rinko came up with something unprecedented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An election itself is based on how popular the candidate is, right? So if one of the participants was an idol, it would increase their approval rating, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But how exactly are we going to do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idols and stars often upload pictures on social networks, right? I'll just use the power of the Internet to show everyone Ayanon-senpai's charm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. We could post them on the student council website, as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mankind has progressed forward to the age of the Internet. After the election was announced, more people would start visiting the home page, and showing pictures and such of Ayano there would help visitors pay more attention to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we need to take pictures, I can borrow Koharu-senpai's digital camera." "Fufu. There's no need for that, Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Airi got up from her seat. She continued speaking as she showed her phone screen to everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a lot of pictures of our beloved Ayano-senpai. Each and every one of them will make your heart throb out of cuteness!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you have all those, Airi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been secretly taking these pictures at every possible opportunity." "Don't do that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But right now they'll come in handy. Taking pictures is something that can take a lot of time, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Rinko pointed out, their time was precious right now, so they postponed questioning Airi about why said pictures existed in the first place. They all gathered around her instead, selecting the good pictures that they could use. Her collection was quite large, and the pictures ranged from photos of Ayano spacing out in the courtyard to photos of her sipping some banana orange juice to photos of her taking a quick nap in the student council office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that one is really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This photo of Ayano-senpai sticking her tongue out like a cat is really cute, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Some had her sticking out her tongue after tasting some hot ramen in the school cafeteria. All of them had high idol potential.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This one here here is also adorable. She's making a cat paw with a stray cat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh. Good eye there, Mitani." "Nagase-san, this is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I feel like I'm going to die of embarrassment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano, for her part, seemed like she was taking enormous damage as everyone looked at photos of her most embarrassing moments. And while the four of them were busy being completely engrossed, the leader of support, Shiho, entered the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh? What are you all doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi and Rinko turned around to answer her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're deciding what pictures of Ayano-senpai we're going to be uploading to the homepage."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This way, we'll definitely get a higher approval rating!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? But isn't it pretty bad to upload your real name and picture to the Internet…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho's single question caused their entire "Idol Plan" to fall to pieces. In the end, they decided to just hold a second handshake session.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm home~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome back, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was after 7 PM in the evening when Keiki finally returned home from all the election work. Mizuha was sitting on a couch in the living room and reading a book.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, what are you reading?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This? The people from the manga research club were handing it out." "The manga research club was?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he accepted it from Mizuha and looked it over, it seemed to be a short manga created by the manga research club. It was around 20 pages long. The cover was simplistic-looking, and the title read 'The Love Story of the Impossible Night'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's really interesting. Though it's a bit sad," Mizuha said. "Ohh… Can I borrow it for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure, I've read it countless times already."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki quickly returned to his room and immediately started reading it. As he skimmed through it, he found out that it was a story about a single woman's love. The setting was a country in Europe during the Middle Ages. The characters in the story were a boy and a girl who dearly loved each other, but couldn't be together because it wasn't allowed, which led to their misfortune.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it was short, it was of excellent quality, and it showed the reader the pros and cons of 'Pure Love.' Contrasting the two protagonists, there was also a married couple in the story who were friends of theirs. This couple was living a peaceful and happy life, to the point where the reader was led to think 'Normies should go explode' while reading it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is why Onizuka-san's approval rating was this high…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This manga must be the reason for the anti-romantic-relationship movement that was going on. It was an original manga that the club made using their entire effort. On top of that, for those who didn't manage to get a printed copy, it was also uploaded to the manga research club's homepage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They even have codes for the online version floating around… If I recall correctly, they made some doujinshi back during the culture festival which was really popular, so they might have gotten a few fans through that."</p>
<p class="null-p">That explained why Megumi wasn't lagging behind on the approval rating polls. They had managed to gather votes by using this unbelievable method. On top of that, the inside cover of the book said that this was an original story written by Onizuka Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is what Onizuka-san came up with."</p>
<p class="null-p">The boys from the club seemed to have helped out with the drawing and the rest. When Keiki checked on his smartphone, it said that the manga had been published on the manga research club's homepage around a week earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">Creating the story and drawing the entire manga must have taken a lot of time. Considering that, Megumi had to have been preparing for this election for a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The drawings were clean, and the story was quite excellent. Truth be told, it</p>
<p class="null-p">was better than some manga you'd see in stores. "Even Mizuha really enjoyed it, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching movies was one of Mizuha's hobbies, so she was actually quite hard to please. If she was praising it, then it had to be something special.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just why is she so dead-set on banning romantic relationships?</p>
<p class="null-p">The Onizuka faction was taking this election really seriously. This manga alone proved it. However, that still didn't explain the reason behind Megumi's campaign pledge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I'll have to dig a bit deeper."</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't planning on trying to find a weakness he could exploit. He was just curious as to what merit her campaign pledge had for her, and what the girl was thinking when she wrote this story.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Wednesday, the third day of election week. In order to figure out Megumi's goal, Keiki had been closely watching her all morning. She had friends in their class, and whenever it was break time, she would talk with them. During class, she always did her work diligently, and when she went to the toilet, another girl always accompanied her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… There's not really any good time to talk to her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus lunch break arrived without him finding any success at all. After she finished her lunch, Megumi left the classroom, this time alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright! This is my chance!</p>
<p class="null-p">As this maybe once-in-a-lifetime chance arrived, Keiki got up from his seat and followed Megumi. Right when he started walking, he saw that Megumi had already progressed quite far, and she was hurrying down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he managed to follow her down, he was engulfed by a wave of people returning from the cafeteria and completely lost his target in the</p>
<p class="null-p">process.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just where did she go…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Times like these made him wish that they had exchanged their contact information during the school trip. While he wandered around the first floor, he cursed his own poor communication skills.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm? That fluffy hair over there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Outside the school building, he spotted a familiar-looking girl standing in the cold December breeze on the courtyard, watching something quite intensely. Though she had her back to Keiki, there could only be one person with such characteristic hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is she looking at?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could see her from his position, but he couldn't tell exactly what she was looking at. Since she didn't show any signs of moving, Keiki decided to go there himself. With his indoor shoes still on, he approached the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san?" "Wahaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he called out to her, she jumped into the air like a scared kitten. "Who?! …Ah, oh, it's Kiryuu-shi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she saw that the person was a classmate of hers, a slightly irritated filled her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't scare me like that, okay>"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I didn't think you'd be so surprised."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki himself was a bit shocked that she had overreacted so much. "What are you even doing here, Onizuka-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Weren't you looking towards one of the windows in the school building?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I wasn't watching! …If you don't have any business with me, then I'll take my leave here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hold on a second!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! W-Why are you panicking so much…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi tried to hurry back to the school building, but Keiki called out to her again to stop her. He spoke a bit louder than usual, and Megumi was slightly perplexed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to calmly listen to me… Onizuka-san, things will end up problematic if you return to the school building like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit hard to say, but your skirt is flipped up completely…" "Fuwah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she jumped out of shock before, it must have gotten stuck at her upper uniform. Thanks to that, if she had returned to the school building like that, her yellow underwear would have been in plain sight for anyone she turned her back towards. After hurriedly fixing it, she gave Keiki a quick bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…T-Thank you very much. You really saved me there." "No problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was glad he had managed to avoid a panty-revealing tragedy. "But I wish you had told me a bit sooner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll keep that in mind for next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There will be no next time!" Megumi protested. "…Anyway, I'm going back to the classroom now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second. Can I have some of your time?" "What for? Is this a confession?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I just have something to talk about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, you helped me out there, so I guess a bit should be fine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was a bit too cold for them to stay outside for very long, they decided to move back inside. Keiki bought two cans of hot coffee at the vending machine in front of the student entrance and handed one to Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My treat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you," Megumi accepted it gratefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Resting her back against the wall, she just held the can in her hand without opening it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you currently acting as Fujimoto-chan's secretary? What if some weird rumours start to spread if people see us being this close?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Talking with my classmate is a totally normal thing to do, isn't it?" "Well, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Megumi finally opened the can, took a sip, and turned her gaze towards Keiki. She looked slightly wary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did you want to talk about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's something I wanted to ask you, Onizuka-san." "What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so keen on prohibiting romantic relationships like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to change the current school rules, so there must be something she was currently dissatisfied with. The current student council was working their hardest to enable every student to have an enjoyable student life. The atmosphere on school grounds was pleasant, and Keiki quite liked this school. That was why he couldn't come up with any possible reason as to why Megumi would go this far.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why… huh?" Megumi's voice was shaky, and her emotions sounded like they were about to all flow out at once. "Because everyone hurt Nao-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nao-kun…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You must have met him before, Kiryuu-shi. He was deceived by the current student council member Mitani Rin, and was rejected. He was the president of the culture festival committee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The president… of the culture festival committee…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard these keywords, he remembered a single individual that fit this description.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… He was the one who Rintarou turned down?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, in the middle of October, there was a tragedy that occurred during the culture festival. The committee president, who had an intellectual look to him, mistook Rin, who was wearing female clothes, for a girl, and had confessed as a result. Naturally, Rin rejected him in the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. The president of the culture festival committee-Inui Naoya-is my childhood friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had no idea…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To think that incident would be connected to this. The world really could be so small at times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why would this cause you to register as a candidate for a student council election?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After Mitani-shi rejected him, Nao-kun was really depressed. Well, who could blame him? He was crushing on a boy who was just crossdressing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that makes sense…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nobody would expect someone they had feelings for to be a crossdressing boy. Something like that would cause most people to be a shut-in for a month, no doubt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried my best to cheer him up, but he wouldn't try at all. He looked at me with dead eyes and told me 'I won't love anyone anymore.' He was just like some Japanese singer, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"While he was at rock bottom, he was forced to watch all the couples flirting at school. What do you think he felt during that time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Undoubtedly, he would think "Normies should just explode." After hearing her out this far, even Keiki had to understand Megumi's feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I decided to split up all the couples at the school. I want to become council president and ban any romantic relationships."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He understood Megumi's reason for all of this. She was trying to change the current school atmosphere for her childhood friend's sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, this entire situation is Rintarou's fault.</p>
<p class="null-p">But he decided to postpone that problem for now. Before that, there was something Keiki had to clear up with his classmate who was in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san, are you really okay with that?" "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After hearing you out like this, it sounds like you like Inui-senpai, right?" "Funya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he asked her bluntly like that, Megumi's entire face turned bright red. That reaction was answer enough.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_09_15.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is there something wrong with that?!" "No, not at all, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But what?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you ban romantic relationships, you won't be able to go out with Inui- senpai, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Assuming that Megumi won the election, and that she would be able to make it an actual rule. The rule wouldn't just affect every student. Naturally, it would also extend to Megumi herself. That would mean that even if she managed to confess to Inui, they wouldn't be able to go out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or that's what Keiki thought, but Megumi's reaction was rather simple. "Ahh, so that's what you mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that I've liked Nao-kun ever since I was a child. However, I could never muster up the courage to confess. Even after all this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that I would confess my feelings after I started attending high school, but whenever I had a good chance, I always got scared…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Confessing your feelings to the person you love is never an easy feat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I didn't get to see Nao-kun as much anymore, and we sort of distanced ourselves… It even felt like he was avoiding me, and then he became so engrossed with Mitani-shi… only to be rejected…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm sorry about Mitani…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His crossdressing hobby had seriously messed up Megumi's life big time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…My male classmates always ganged up on me and teased me. Because my family name is Onizuka, they called me Oniko, and I really hated that. I mean, an oni, you know? They're those creatures who always do horrible things in stories and so on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I can see why you didn't like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The onis and demons who appear in stories never gave off a good image. Being made fun of as a child because of her family name must have been tough for Megumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Around that time, Nao-kun moved into my neighbourhood. He took care of the boys who were tormenting me, and since we went to the same school, we naturally ended up walking there and back together, and we often went to each other's houses… Though I didn't realize I liked him until a bit later."</p>
<p class="null-p">She realized she had feelings for him when she entered middle school. However, though she was aware of her feelings, she was never able to openly confess to him, and they spent their time together as childhood friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And thus, since I was unable to go out with Nao-kun, I ended up as this Otasa Princess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, you entered the manga research club because of that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Having otakus fawning over you isn't a terribly bad thing, you know?" "Uwah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Onizuka-shi was actually quite an unusual person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really care about my feelings. I just want Nao-kun to be able to enjoy the rest of his high school life. I just want to see him smile."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If Ayano was a stereotypical student council president candidate, Megumi was a completely abnormal one. Unlike Ayano, who wanted everyone to</p>
<p class="null-p">have an enjoyable school life, Megumi was working for the sake of a single boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, Onizuka-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He understood her goal completely. The reason why she wanted to ban romantic relationships, and why she was so passionate about the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">However-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still can't let you become the student council president."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…" After muttering that, Megumi looked at Keiki with a sad smile. "I guess we'll have to settle this through the election, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, after classes ended, the four student council members, excluding Shiho, met in the student council office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, that really makes me look like the bad guy." "Good grief, how will you make this up to us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's think about his punishment later. Inui-senpai really is the victim here." "I feel bad for him…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the classes were over, Keiki had made his way to the student council office and told them everything he had heard from Megumi. He was a bit hesitant to tell them about her feelings, but now that Rintarou was involved, so was the entire student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, wasn't that just his fault for getting the wrong idea?" The boy, who was still wearing a skirt, pouted. "I never once said that I was a girl, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anybody would think you're a girl when you're wearing a skirt like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, you were getting aroused when looking at my body as well, right? At least in the beginning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still want to die because of that, so don't make me remember," Keiki retorted.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to hit himself for feeling any sort of attraction to a boy like Rintarou. It was one of the worst times in his life that he wanted to seal away forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm surprised that Nagase-san is even feeling pity here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi hated men with a burning passion. Even so, she still seemed to feel sympathy for the man who couldn't love anymore after what had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keikun-senpai, you might even enjoy wearing girl's clothes if you try it out, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll never do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Kiryuu-senpai, you've worn a bunny girl suit before, haven't you?" "How do you know that, Nagase-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because Yuika showed me during our sleepover a while ago." "Yuika-chaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what was Yuika showing other people?! Keiki was about to relive the nightmare of when he was forced to wear that. That was most likely another of his top three moments he would rather lock away for all eternity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to see that as well," Ayano said. "You won't. You definitely won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">He'd rather have her smell him than let her see something like that. "Well, let's focus on the election for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, just wasting time like this isn't a good idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their time they could use was limited. Rather than blaming Rinko, they should focus on their preparations for winning the election. As Keiki turned the problem at hand over in his head, Ayano spoke in his direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onizuka-san is trying to change the school for the person she likes, right?" "Yeah, that's what she said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that's her reason, then we definitely can't lose." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano wanted every student to enjoy their student life to the fullest. It was her wish and her driving force. Studying and forging relations in clubs was important, but spending time with the person you love was also an important part of developing as a person. She could understand Megumi's feelings, but sacrificing the happiness of many for the happiness of a single person wasn't an option.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with these feelings, two days were left.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Airi tasked Keiki with gathering materials for a speech, so he headed to the library room. He picked up several books, sat down at a nearby window, and started going through each and every one one of them, making notes about important details. While he was focusing on his work, a voice called out to him from the seat across the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kiryuu-kun. So we meet again." "…Ahh, hello."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he raised his head, he was greeted once more by the rather sharp-gazed boy he had met a few days ago. He seemed to be an upperclassman, but Keiki still couldn't figure out where he had seen him before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Sorry, but have we met?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, do you not remember? We worked together during the culture festival."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The culture festival…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Something sparked in the back of his mind, but nothing clicked. "Hmm… I still don't really remember."</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Ehhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when he went through the culture festival folder in his mind, the person in front of him wasn't in there. His special trait was his rather sharp gaze, so there was no way he would forget about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, would you remember if I did this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The book took out a case from next to his study material and put on glasses. The shape of the round glasses combined with the face wearing them suddenly jostled Keiki's memories-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… Ahhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He finally understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the president from the culture festival committee?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like you've finally remembered. I'm Inui Naoya. I've been acting as the culture festival execution committee president."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because he hadn't been wearing his glasses, Keiki hadn't recognized him at all. He was the protagonist of the tragedy that had occurred during the culture festival: The person Rintarou had rejected when he was wearing girl's clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inui-senpai, were you wearing the glasses just for show?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was always told that I had a pretty nasty glare. As a result, I wasn't popular with the girls at all, so I put on glasses when I became a third year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After proving his identity to Keiki, the upperclassman took off his glasses again and took a seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that he looks a bit scary without his glasses…</p>
<p class="null-p">Just from talking to him, however, Keiki knew that he was a person with a kind heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, recently I started feeling like an idiot. Like I was pretending to be someone I'm not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you look better this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you… That reminds me, you were a member of the student council, weren't you, Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was a provisional member during the culture festival, but I'm not there officially anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you must know how Mitani-kun rejected me, right?" "Well… I know the general gist…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki answered honesty, and the boy showed a listless expression in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really liked Mitani-kun. The gods above really are horrible at times. They made a boy like him look so cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry… about a lot of things…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, it's not something you have to apologize for, Kiryuu-kun." "I heard from a friend that it was quite a shock for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I wonder who you heard that from… Well, I really was in a state of shock right after being rejected. I was so depressed that I even started thinking that it wouldn't be too bad as long as he was cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's definitely a terminal illness."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how cute he was, he was still a boy. He had a totally normal meat rod hanging between his legs, even if said rod was hidden by a skirt instead of pants.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I couldn't just stay like that forever. I started studying like a madman in order to deal with the shock."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…? Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki noticed a small detail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inui-senpai, have you always been studying in this library room? In this very seat?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Yeah, I usually study here." "Even yesterday during lunch break?" "Yeah. I'm surprised you knew that." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The pieces connected inside Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see… So Onizuka-san was watching him yesterday…</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he didn't know the reason, Megumi and Naoya had drifted apart. Just meeting each other in person had started to become awkward, so she must have been watching him from afar. Realizing that, Keiki couldn't help but think that she was acting really cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What book are you reading, Kiryuu-kun?" "It's a book related to public speaking." "Public speaking?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the secretary for the candidate Fujimoto-san for the upcoming student council election."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's why," Naoya nodded along in affirmation. "Speaking about the election, the other candidate Onizuka Megumi is actually my childhood friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Megumi's name suddenly came up, Keiki acted like this was the first he had heard of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I was really surprised to hear that she was running for student council president. Megumi-chan isn't the type of person to show her face in public like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard that one line, Keiki was certain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inui-senpai really doesn't know why Onizuka-san registered as a candidate. Well, Keiki hardly imagined that Megumi had told Naoya about it anyway. Should I tell him that Onizuka-san has feelings for him?</p>
<p class="null-p">Since they were childhood friends, Naoya should at least think of Megumi in a good light. They might start going out, and Megumi might even lose her reason to become the student council president.</p>
<p class="null-p">…No, I can't. I can't just tell him about Onizuka-san's feelings without her permission.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wouldn't be able to forgive himself if he did that. Telling him about the girl's feelings, which she had held close for years now, was something he couldn't do, not even for the greater good.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Wait a second. What if I just encourage the two of them to get closer again?</p>
<p class="null-p">Playing cupid here should be a safe thing to do. Since he already did that for</p>
<p class="null-p">Ootori Koharu and Akiyama Shouma before, he at least had a basic knowledge of how to go about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he had decided upon it, he started immediately. "The thing is, Onizuka-san is actually a classmate of mine." "Oh, really? That's quite a coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You must still be close to her since you're childhood friends, right?" "Well… We haven't actually met each other much as of recently." "Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… it's a bit hard to say, but…" Naoya continued as he scratched his cheek. "A while ago, Megu-chan found the porn magazines I was hiding in my room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?" Keiki couldn't hold back his baffled surprise. "And, well… They were a bit kinky…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, a bit…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megu-chan did forgive me with a smile, but meeting her in person has been a bit awkward after that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because it was such a simple reason, Keiki had problems comprehending the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the reason their relationship grew distant?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Megumi and Naoya had said they felt that the other person was avoiding them, but Keiki never thought that it could be because of porn magazines. The girl herself most likely didn't care much about that at all. She was probably more worried about him and his broken heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Megu-chan was the first person to reach out to me after the culture festival ended. She's a kind girl, so I'm sure that she was trying to cheer me up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's what I think as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, he heard it from Megumi herself, so there was no mistaking it. She really must be a kind girl. Otherwise she wouldn't try to make the school a better place for the boy she liked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be completely honest… I liked Megumi-chan." "Ohh, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">……</p>
<p class="null-p">………</p>
<p class="null-p">………… "…Ehhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His reaction was severely delayed. "You liked Onizuka-san, Inui-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. But she started avoiding me like that and joined the manga research club. She started being all flirty with the boys, so I couldn't really confess… That was why I was looking for a new love…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They had completely missed each other. This was a practically textbook shoujo manga story. If just one side confessed, it would end happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that's why you fell for Rintarou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. I wanted to give up on Megumi-chan, but seeing how much she cared for me and tried to cheer me up… how do I put it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You fell for her completely." "Well, that's basically it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inui-senpai, you're unexpectedly easy." "I'm sorry for being an easy Senpai, okay?!" "Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">So much unexpected information appeared that Keiki had problems dealing with it all.</p>
<p class="null-p">So basically… they both like each other, right…?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was quite a sudden development, but he couldn't let this chance go to waste, since he was a cupid at work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then you should confess to Onizuka-san! Right now!" "Eh, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have to hurry! Onizuka-san is a cute girl, so she might get taken by someone else if you're not careful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… I was trying to get together with another girl… And I'm really pitiful. I was even rejected by a crossdresser…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't matter right now! I know! How about we practice right here for the real deal later!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, why are you going this far…?" "It's because I want you two to be happy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither of them knew about the other party, but both Megumi and Naoya had feelings for each other. If he confessed to her now, he would definitely not get rejected. If her love turned into reality, there would be no need for her to ban romantic relationships, and Ayano could smoothly move on to become</p>
<p class="null-p">the student council president. It was two birds with one stone.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order for that to happen, Inui-senpai has to take the first step right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">The key to everyone's happiness right now was held by the boy with the bad glare in his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is it really fine for me to confess to Megumi-chan…?" "Of course it is! Love is freedom, after all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love… is… freedom…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a serious expression on his face, Keiki threw together a jumble of good- sounding words in an attempt to convince Naoya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I get it, Kiryuu-kun! I'll confess to Megumi-chan!" "Yes, please do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If possible, could you help me practice?" "By all means, yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The committee president finally decided to get serious. Luckily, nobody was using the library room right now, so they wouldn't bother the other students while they loudly conversed like this. In this moment, both of them stood up and directly looked each other in the eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's start this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes! …I-I… I actually like you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No good at all! Is this all your love is about?! One more time!" "I like you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Louder! Let your voice roar with your feelings!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I… I actually-" Naoya took a deep breath. "I love youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Packing all his feelings into these words, he screamed louder than ever. His third consecutive confession was perfect.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright!" Keiki made a fist with his hand. "-Heh?" Nanjou Mao's baffled voice leaked out. "Eh, Nanjou?! Why are you here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was holding some grammar books, and looked like she was returning them to the library, but she had stumbled upon them with the worst possible timing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Kiryuu is… being wooed by an ikemen with a sharp glare?!" "Wooed?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As naturally as she breathed, the fujoshi saw everything through yaoi vision. Truth be told, though, anyone who passed by with that kind of timing would think that this was a heartfelt confession scene from boy to boy. Ever since the d*ck accident had happened on the school trip, her eyes had looked a bit lifeless, but now they were radiating with energy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh no… I have to immediately make a manuscript of this…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"THANK YOU VERY MUUUUUUUUUCH!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked like a fish being put back in the water after being stranded on the beach. Having been granted such wonderful new material, Mao immediately dashed out of the library room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How could this happen…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao had received even more dangerous material after the Rintarou confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That girl just now was a friend of yours, right, Kiryuu-kun? I'm sorry. I think I gave her the wrong idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's my fault. Let's just forget about Nanjou and continue our practice." "There's no need for that, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Inui-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I think calmly about it, I really don't have any right to confess to Megumi-chan. It would just sound forced after I tried to go after Mitani-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I feel bad for having you cheer me on like this, I'm going to give up. Megumi-chan and I just aren't a good match," The smile he showed while he said this truly hurt Keiki in the chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Nao-kun and I aren't a good match, huh?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she had business in the library room, or maybe she had heard Naoya's voice when he yelled. Either way, when the two boys turned around, Megumi was standing there, her face downcast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Megumi-chan…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that makes sense… We really don't complement each other… Someone like me and Nao-kun would never… There's no way, right…?" Her voice was shaking, and tears started running down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">As things stood, she seemed to be having a grave misunderstanding. "Onizuka-san, that's not…!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, before Keiki could tell her the truth, she ran away from the spot. "Onizuka-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wouldn't even stop after he called out to her, and she left the room behind her. All Keiki could do was watch her flee.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is this happening…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If the cupid of love heard about this, he'd be disappointed in Keiki. Rather than helping them find love together as a couple, he had done something unnecessary, and had caused their relationship to become even more awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">1 Her family name is written with the kanji for "Oni", a demon-like creature, so the term "Oniko" basically means "demon child."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">The pre-election campaigning continued all the way until the second-to-last day of the week: Thursday. Keiki and Mizuha were leisurely walking to school, the same as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure is cold today." "It's December already."</p>
<p class="null-p">Time passed as quickly as always, and there was about a month left until the end of the year. Right after the election ended, it would be time for the end- term exams. After that was Christmas, New Year's Eve, and winter break.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky looked a bit grey today, as if it might start raining every second. It was even enough to make you feel cold. Mizuha was wearing a thin coat over her normal uniform, but her cheeks had already turned a bit red shortly after leaving the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if it will snow this year," Mizuha said. "Maybe," Keiki gave a vague reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had been living in this city for a long time now, but it never really snowed that often. If it did, it happened maybe two to three times every year. And even if it did, it melted pretty soon afterward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There seems to be a lot of snow at grandpa's place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I saw it in the news. They seem to have almost too much snow every year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I bet you couldn't even live there, Mizuha, since you're so sensitive to the cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, probably not."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a faint laugh, Mizuha changed the topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, are you helping again with the election today?" "Yep, that's the plan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow is voting day, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">The day after this marked the final day of the election week. The plan was that the candidates would give a speech in the gym hall, and everyone would vote immediately after.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do your best, okay? I'm cheering for you." "Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki was planning on helping Ayano win. However, there was one thing still stuck in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">..Is Onizuka-san going to be okay?</p>
<p class="null-p">He had exchanged contact information with Inui-senpai, but it sounded like Inui hadn't managed to contact Megumi at all. She had turned down any sort of communication, as if she completely intended to ignore him. That probably meant that it would be even more difficult for Keiki to approach her. Odds were very high that she would even run away from her classmate. Only Keiki knew that the two of them actually had feelings for one another. He had tried his best to get them together, but it had spectacularly failed. If anything, they were even further apart now. He had to take responsibility for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't just allow Megumi to become student council president with her current misunderstanding. He had to help them discover each other's feelings and help guide Fujimoto to victory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I have no other choice but to power through the final day, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The day before, the newspaper club had put out another approval rating poll, and it hadn't changed much from the one revealed on Monday. Just as Airi had suspected, the anti-romantic-relationship group hadn't grown any further. If they managed to get through the speech on Friday, Ayano should win with more than half of the votes, and she should become the next student council president.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for Megumi, they would just have to calmly explain the circumstances later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm? What's going on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a lot of people gathered there."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he arrived at the school building with Mizuha, they found a large amount of people crowded around the blackboard at the student entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kiryuu-senpai! We've got trouble!" "Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please look at this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi quickly grabbed Keiki's wrist and pulled him over to the blackboard. "Look!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Two pictures were hung up, intentionally covering Ayano's election poster. "What is this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The right picture showed Keiki being hugged by Ayano next to the vending machine. The left picture showed Shiho grabbing Keiki's head and pushing it into her bosom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Beneath both pictures, there was a bold black caption:</p>
<p class="null-p">'Kiryuu Keiki from Class 2B is two-timing!'</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">*This afterword contains spoilers, so for those who haven't read the main book, please proceed with caution.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you very much for picking up the 9th installment of the Hensuki series.</p>
<p class="null-p">After quite some time, we finally have a new character in the form of the classmate Onizuka-san. How did you like her? I always wanted to write an Otasa Princess like this, so I'm happy that I've finally found the chance. Her charming points are clearly her princess-like long, frilly hair, and her quite frank manner of speaking. She's quite the reckless girl, going so far as to run for student council president…</p>
<p class="null-p">On top of that, we had the reappearance of the culture festival committee president. The one who was forced to go through the tragedy at the culture festival. On top of that, he's now turned into new BL material for Mao. What an unlucky fellow. There was even an illustration of him in the 7th volume, so for those interested, feel free to go back to it (he was the one with the glasses).</p>
<p class="null-p">The 9th volume this time was a combination of the school trip and the student council election. Mizuha conducted a stripshow, and Keiki and Nanjou got closer (in multiple meanings of the word). There was quite a lot of thick content this time around, if I do say so myself. Since Yuika-chan and Sayuki- senpai didn't get much screen time this time around, I want to give them some more in the next volume.</p>
<p class="null-p">The student council election and Megumi's love troubles will continue in the next volume. The main series has entered the December timeframe as well, so I'll be writing some more in-season events. I hope you're looking forward to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll do my utmost to keep the story interesting in the future as well, so please continue to support me. Here's hoping that we can meet each other again in the 10th installment.</p>
