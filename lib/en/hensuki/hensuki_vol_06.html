<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">Three students were present in the student council office. Airi was standing with a stern expression on her face. Keiki was cowering behind her. And finally, sitting at the table on a chair was another female student with wavy semi-long hair. Her name was Takasaki Shiho. The blue ribbon on her chest made it clear that she was a third-year student, and she was the acting student council president. Currently, she was holding Airi's phone in her hand, looking through various photos that had been taken a few minutes prior in the calligraphy clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those photos showed four girls, each of them wearing bunny girl outfits, and a single male student in between them. Of course, it goes without saying that this boy was Kiryuu Keiki. As for the bunny girls, they were all of the female members of the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see, I see. Now these are some rather interesting pictures."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho said this with absolutely no tension in her voice while lifting her gaze from the smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Based on these pictures, Airi-chan wants to tell me 'How indecent it is to wear bunny girl outfits at a learning institution like ours! Don't just skip your club activities!!!' or something along those lines?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly, Shiho-senpai! All of the female members of the calligraphy club have suffered from this beast's poisonous fangs too much already! Since the rumour of a calligraphy club harem is filling the school, I say that, in order to protect this school's morals, we should disband the calligraphy club once and for all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting her hands on the table, Airi pushed her body forward and boldly</p>
<p class="null-p">made her case. Keiki watched her while her beige-ish twintails swayed with her movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">This has turned into something very complicated, hasn't it?</p>
<p class="null-p">After Airi had seen the bunny girls getting touchy-feely with Keiki, she immediately dragged him here. Just as she had declared in the clubroom earlier, she wanted to receive permission from the student council president to disband the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase Airi greatly hated men. She was a first-year student, as well as the treasurer of the student council. Seeing Keiki in that situation back then seemed to have flared up her anger anew.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would've been better if Sayuki-senpai was the one who was dragged out here…</p>
<p class="null-p">The club president of the calligraphy club was currently changing back into her normal clothes with the other club members. The obvious reason was that she couldn't exactly walk down the hallway in a bunny girl costume, so Airi judged that Keiki would do as club representative for the time being.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as the club president isn't here, it's up to me to stop the calligraphy club from being disbanded…!</p>
<p class="null-p">The calligraphy club was a place that was very dear to Sayuki's heart. He couldn't allow it to be destroyed over this sort of reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why Airi-chan dragged Kiryuu-kun here. Now, now. This seems to be getting quite interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't call it interesting, Takasaki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Keiki had been helping out the student council quite a bit, so of course he had been in contact with the student council president Takasaki Shiho. That was why he acted familiar with her right then. Airi didn't seem to like that, however, and turned her gaze towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please refrain from talking right now, Kiryuu-senpai. You have no right to</p>
<p class="null-p">speak. Of course, you have no right to keep silent, either." "Then what should I do…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't allowed to talk, nor was he allowed his mouth shut. His Kouhai's requests were too hard for him to fulfill.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, in order to save the victims from the calligraphy club, I advise that we should disband it!" said Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Shiho showed a rather bitter smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… But this is just the girls wearing bunny girl costumes while playing a bit, right? I think that disbanding the club because of this is taking it a bit too far, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way?! B-But, Kiryuu-senpai was playing around with them, you know?! He probably likes bunny girl costumes, and he forced them to wear them for his own entertainment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Airi-chan says, but have you really been two-timing, or rather, four- timing, Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just a misunderstanding. I wasn't the one who told them to wear them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures. I don't think that you're the type to do that sort of thing, either." "Shiho-senpai?!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"I'm still the student council president, so I have an eye for people. Kiryuu- kun isn't the kind of person who would force a girl into something like this. Airi-chan probably knows that herself, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho's direct question made Airi hesitate. In a matter of seconds, Keiki's Kouhai had turned into a domestic girl. Just what you would expect from the student council president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, wearing bunny girl costumes on school grounds is taking it a bit too far, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I really can't disband the club just because of this." "No, you can't…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shiho made her decision, Airi hung her head, while… "We're saved…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki let out a relieved sigh. Thinking about it, disbanding a club because of this would have been a bit overboard, so the student council president's decision was understandable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But bunny girl costumes are taking it a bit too far, so please tell everyone from the club to refrain from wearing them on school grounds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Personally, I would like to write off this incident with that, but-" Shiho stopped mid-sentence and looked over at Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi-chan still doesn't seem all that satisfied with this result."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Kiryuu-senpai's doubt hasn't been cleared up in the slightest</p>
<p class="null-p">yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're as serious as ever. Though that's also a good thing about you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, Shiho put on hand on her lips, thinking about something. Shortly afterwards, she gave a slight nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you really can't accept it, then how about you spend some time in the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's and Airi's voices overlapped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll be joining the calligraphy club to see for yourself if they really are conducting proper club work or not. If you see it with your own eyes, you'll be satisfied, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't let you slack off from your work in the student council, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand! I'll do my best! I will reveal Kiryuu-senpai's harem plans, and save the girls from his grasp!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm? Isn't the conversation taking a rather weird turn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition, Keiki only had a bad feeling about Airi watching over club activities.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you, Kiryuu-kun? I think this is a good chance for you to rid yourselves of the doubts that she still has."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if it's only that, then I don't mind…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Plus, he'd feel sad if the distance between them became greater because of one misunderstanding. Especially after he had worked so hard to close it. Of course he'd take this chance to make up with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not going to decline this, Senpai? If there's nothing happening in your club, then there should be no problems, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, no problem at all. Check out the club until you're satisfied, Nagase- san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Exactly. Since the rumour about Keiki building a harem was completely false, there should be no problems with this. If she were to see the club performing their daily activities, then even Airi should understand-</p>
<p class="null-p">…Wait a second?</p>
<p class="null-p">If Airi were to investigate the calligraphy club, she would naturally talk with the other club members as well, and not just Keiki. And, as for said other members, there was a hardcore sadistic molester Senpai, a hardcore sadistic Kouhai, a BL mangaka, and an exibitionist-</p>
<p class="null-p">There's plenty of problems?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Setting aside the doubts about Keiki having a harem, if Airi found out about the girls' respective secret personalities, things would be bad in a different sense. Nagase Airi hated anything immoral. If she were to find out about the various fetishes, the club would definitely be disbanded immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">I definitely have to hide everyone's secrets from Nagase-san…!</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the curtains were lifted on the fierce battle for the calligraphy club's survival.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: This calligraphy club has a problem</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning, Keiki was walking to school as usual, his little sister Mizuha next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like this is going to get pretty crazy. Having Nagase-san join our club temporarily, I mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can say that again. To think that we'd attract the attention of a student council member…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Airi was watching the calligraphy club, Keiki had two main duties ahead of him. The first was to clear her doubts about Keiki being a 'Harem king'. The second was to protect the various secrets that each respective club member held. If he failed in either duty, the club could very well be disbanded immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do I have to go through all of this? I'm the victim who was assaulted by a group of bunny girls…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That really was a blunder. To think that Nii-san would actually arrive with a person from the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never expected Mizuha to turn into a bunny girl, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was I cute?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were crazy cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, it's good that you're so honest. Just tell me when you want to see it again, okay? I'll become a bunny girl for you whenever you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Flirting like that, they arrived at school. After putting on their respective indoor shoes, they headed to their classrooms. Though Keiki and Mizuha were older brother and younger sister, they were in the same school year, so their classrooms were on the same floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like I told all of you yesterday, you'd better hold off on your perverted desires until Nagase-san's supervision is over, alright? So always wear panties when you come to school, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While they were walking up the stairs, Mizuha came to a sudden halt. Noticing that she had stopped, Keiki turned around to face Mizuha, only to see her nervously fidgeting with her thighs, pushing them together-</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki saw this sight, a bad premonition assaulted him. "…Umm, Mizuha-san? Why are you fidgeting like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm at the age where girls become a bit rebellious, you know…" "Meaning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To put it frankly… I'm not wearing panties now…" "Heeeeeeeeeeeeey?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus said the exibitionist, who went to school without wearing panties on a</p>
<p class="null-p">regular basis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, come over here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to avoid the worst case scenario, he grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to an empty side corridor with no one else around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your Onii-chan won't forgive you if you enjoy your school life without wearing any panties, you know?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then are you going to put them on for me again, Nii-san?" "Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard her sudden proposal, Keiki let out a flabbergasted grunt. When her older brother froze, Mizuha looked straight at him with reddened cheeks and expectant eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't tell me… Was this her plan all along?</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a time before when Keiki had been forced to put panties on Mizuha, and it seemed like she wasn't able to forget the thrill from back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would… Nii-san please put them on for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This siscon older brother was weak against his little sister's wishes. No matter how tremendous that wish is, it was the Onii-chan's duty to follow through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But… Isn't it way too dangerous to do it in a crowded place like school here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's even better for me." "Ehhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed to be fired up even more if the risk was high. However, Keiki couldn't just ignore the current state of affairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should I do here…?!</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened in the moment the siscon older brother was on the verge of despair. A gentle breeze blew past them from an open window close by. Just like a boy playing a prank on the girl he likes in grade school, the wind pushed up Mizuha's skirt from behind-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To reiterate, Mizuha wasn't wearing any panties today. Instead of panties, you could catch a glance of everything if her skirt were lifted up like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Making a split-second decision, Keiki pulled down the skirt with his own hands. If one were to see this, it certainly looked like nothing other than a male high school student fondling a female student's butt.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, you're so bold this early in the morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't wanna be told that by the person who straight up didn't wear underwear to school!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you can, grab me a bit tighter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like hell I will?! What if someone sees us like-" "……Kiryuu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he could even finish his words, the situation he was fearing happened. Airi, who had coincidentally been passing by, was now looking at him with ice-cold eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doing something like this so early in the morning… That's thirty lewd points."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What in the world are lewd points?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi took out a textbook and started writing in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, you've got the wrong idea! I was just holding down my little sister's skirt because a gust of wind blew past!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Little sister?! Just how much of a pervert can you be, Senpai! You're even lusting after your little sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not the pervert here!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The real pervert was Mizuha, who had come to school without wearing panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, he somehow was able to satisfy Airi with the explanation 'I protected my little sister's panties from the gust of wind'. Of course, the real situation was actually 'I protected my little sister's naked crotch from the gust of wind', but saying that would be like shooting himself in the foot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Will I really able to protect everyone's secrets if this one incident was almost fatal?</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, Keiki managed to convince Mizuha to put on panties in the girl's toilet.</p>
<p class="null-p">After certain occurrences, classes ended for the day. Just as she had declared the day prior, Airi came to the calligraphy club room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Nagase Airi from the student council. From today onwards, I will be joining your club activities for a while to investigate you."</p>
<p class="null-p">After she finished her greeting, the girl's gaze wandered across the room. Including Keiki, every club member was present. To name them all, Sayuki, Yuika, Mao, and of course Mizuha, were all sitting around a table on the tatami resting space, drawing letters with a brush.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… You're doing club work unexpectedly honestly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. This is what we look like when we're working hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't get ahead of yourself. Every club would do their club work seriously."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, even Keiki had to agree that they looked like a normal club. Normally, Sayuki would be writing her masochistic desires on her paper, Yuika would be drawing her sadistic picture books where the prince gets enslaved by the princess, and Mao would be working on her BL manga manuscripts. If they did that in front of Airi, there was no doubt that the club would be disbanded. That was why, as soon as Airi had declared her intention to investigate the club, they had to think of countermeasures, namely the 'Perversion Prohibited Mission', which basically consisted of them acting like a normal calligraphy club members would.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, is Kiryuu-senpai not going to write anything?" "I'm something like a manager for this club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…? The calligraphy club needs a manager?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm mostly here to clean the room and prepare other things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so the errand boy of the group. A job that perfectly suits Senpai, in my opinion."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that in a joking manner, Airi showed her first smile of the day. Her tongue was as poisonous as always, but her cute smile made it all worthwhile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But just what I would expect from Tokihara-senpai. I'm not all that familiar with calligraphy, but I can see how much of a difference there is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm honored by your words."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having inherited the skills of her father, and coming from a family who focused on calligraphy, she was the real deal. Her writing was so overwhelming that it wasn't surprising that she had won a special prize in a competition with her work before. With her skill, it almost looked like the letters were moving across the paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why is the topic 'A Loyal Dog'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I admire them for their loyalty. They treasure their owners, and I want to find someone who I can be just as loyal to."</p>
<p class="null-p">To translate into English, she was saying that 'I want to be a dog', but since Airi didn't know her hardcore masochistic nature, she only nodded with an "I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki had no intentions of revealing that she had been totally deceived. He instead only watched over her as she walked over to Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Koga-san wrote 'Devotion' I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because Yuika likes kind and understanding people. They have to do everything for Yuika, listening to whatever she wishes for."</p>
<p class="null-p">Or what she really meant: 'I like obedient bastards. Yuika likes the type of</p>
<p class="null-p">men who don't complain, and listen to her every demand with a smile on their face.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai is drawing-Ah, if I use the family name, I'll be mistaking the older brother with the little sister… To avoid that, I will call the male Kiryuu-senpai 'Kyuuri-senpai'"</p>
<p class="null-p">(T/N : Kyuuri = Cucumber) "Please don't…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want to have the same name as a summer vegetable. "Just call me Mizuha. Everyone else calls me Mizuha as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. Then… Mizuha-senpai's work is titled 'Liberation'." "I don't want to be held down by things, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha-senpai said this as she fidgeted with her waist. The exibitionist probably felt a bit restricted because she had been forced to wear panties today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-senpai's is called… 'Banana'? Do you like bananas by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not just any banana. They have to be thick and burly. Especially if they have a nice curve to them. That really gets my blood pumping."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would that get your blood pumping?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't mind her. And Nanjou, how about you focus on your work again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki forcefully shut up the BL mangaka who often uses a male's banana as reference. And with that, Keiki vowed to himself to never let the man-hating Airi see Mao's doujins. Worst case scenario, she would go crazy just from the cover.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So even these wordplays show a bit of personality I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was looking around at the different works of the calligraphy members again in awe when Sayuki called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san, how about you also try to write something?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just watching us must be pretty boring, right?" "No, I'm on duty right now, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say that, but you're probably just afraid that people will laugh at your bad calligraphy, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the same-year Yuika provoked her, Airi pushed her lips together. "…I understand. I will try one."</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed to hate losing, and she took off her shoes to step on the tatami mat, borrowing a brush from Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My my, not bad, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Airi wrote was 'Honesty', and even Keiki thought that her writing looked rather skillful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are honest boys your type, Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I didn't write it with that meaning… I do hate men as a whole, after all." "Is that so? Even Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see. On top of being a boy, I hate the unfaithful Kiryuu-senpai so much that I feel like vomiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the first time anybody has ever said that about me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki's self-confidence had taken great damage from that comment, the club activities still moved along smoothly. In the middle of it, Mao had gotten bored of 'Banana' and started writing 'Meat stick', 'Phallus', and other terrible words, Mizuha wrote 'Nii-san's' on her thighs and sent Keiki a picture, and Sayuki and Yuika started fighting non-verbally with words like 'Flat-chest', 'Cow Girl', 'Stealing Cat', 'Pig Girl', and so on. But before Airi could spot them, Keiki got rid of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, Koga-san, how about you grip the brush a bit more gently? If you want, this kind Senpai here would be willing to show you the ropes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need for that. Just focus on your own work, Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Yuika's choice of words, question marks appeared above Airi's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Tokihara-senpai 'Witch-senpai'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just a nickname. Sayuki-senpai's hair is so long and so black that it reminds you of a witch, right?" Keiki tried to smooth it over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's what you mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not a nickname, though. It's more like badmouthing," Yuika said. "Yuika-chan… Even though I worked so hard on that followup."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki complained to Yuika, she stuck out her tongue at him. For Keiki, her badmouthing was something natural at this point, but Airi looked like she had spotted something unexpected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So this is how Koga-san acts in the club." "Nagase-san, are you familiar with Yuika-chan?" "Familiar is one way to put it. We're classmates."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though we rarely ever talk. Koga-san is always reading a book in the classroom, so I was a bit surprised to see her like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Yuika-chan can be pretty difficult to get close to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now was a different story, but back when they had first met, she acted very indifferent towards Keiki when he tried to approach her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… would it be fine to ask a question?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi posited these words towards all of the members of the club, excluding Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To everyone in the calligraphy club, what kind of existence is Kiryuu-senpai to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the moment following, the girls who had been questioned exchanged glances. They probably all knew that if they gave a wrong, or a hasty answer, chaos would unfold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"L-Let's see… He's an easy to tease, and cute Kouhai." "He's a Senpai whom Yuika can rely on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's a classmate who is easy to talk with." "He's kind older brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki let out a relieved sigh when they all gave normal answers. He was really glad that their true intentions of wanting him to be their master, slave, and so on didn't leak out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm? Even though it's Kiryuu-senpai we're talking about, you're actually being praised, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Nagase-san looks quite displeased because of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, your big talk won't last long when I finally reveal your true identity!" said the investigator while pointing her finger at Keiki in a self- confident manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">It still was a mystery to Keiki why she was so obsessed with all of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we're back on track now, I'll use this chance to teach Keiki a bit about calligraphy and how to hold the brush. Just today, I will use this brush over here-okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not reach towards my crotch like that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?! K-Kiryuu-senpai really is a playboy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong, okay! This is just one of Sayuki-senpai's jokes is all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Things kept going in a similar manner after that, and although the girls' real identities were very close to leaking out, they somehow survived the first day of Airi's investigation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">At the private Momosawa High School that Keiki and the others attended, the girl's uniforms were different depending on grade.</p>
<p class="null-p">For their summer uniforms, ribbons are used to identify the school years, whereas skirts were used during the winter. The ribbon for the first years was green, the second years was beige, and the third years was blue. Once the season changed to October, it was time to change to winter uniforms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, every member of the calligraphy club was in a nearby cafe for a meeting. Their topic was of course Nagase Airi, who had been investigating the club these past few days.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… It feels like I'm a prisoner at this point," Sayuki let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person comes by almost daily, after all…" Yuika commented, nodding in agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to Yuika was Mao sipping on the straw to her iced coffee, and facing them were the Kiryuu siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just how long is this surveillance going to keep on for…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a shame, but we have no other choice but to put up with it for now. We have to be really careful that everyone's perversion doesn't get leaked. If that happens, the calligraphy club will surely get disbanded for real."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That would be a problem indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'll be a problem when I can't work on my manuscript in the clubroom anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you might as well just stop that altogether."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hideous BL manga manuscript happen to enter his line of sight from time to time. He really wished that she would hold off on that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, as of now, she hasn't found us out yet, and that won't change if you all keep it down with your perverted urges."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe the talk about disbanding the club was rather effective, because even Sayuki had been rather calm these past few days. It could even be said that Keiki was able to spend a rather normal school life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You might as well just all give up your perversion, then we wouldn't have to worry about this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're kinda asking for the impossible here. Nobody will be able to stop my wish to become Keiki-kun's pet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As soon as the supervision from the student council is done, Yuika will definitely make Keiki-senpai her slave!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rehabilitating the perverted girls really would be no easy feat. And while Keiki was sighing in resignation, Mizuha opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Nagase-san so fixated on disbanding the calligraphy club in the first place? She says that it's to protect school morals, but isn't she taking this a bit too seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that she's a bit too fixated on us…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The start of it all was when Keiki had been assaulted by the bunny girls back then. But just telling them off then should have been enough. Maybe she had another goal aside from protecting the school's morals?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe that girl is just simply interested in Keiki-kun?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's hypothesis pulled Keiki completely back to reality. And it seemed like the other girls also wouldn't let that slide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that so, Keiki-senpai?" "Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…?" "Umm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was glared at by Yuika, Mao, and Mizuha, cold sweat ran down his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's pretty unrealistic, right? After all, she seems to hate me so much that she feels like vomiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun stubbornly denied it. Noted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This makes it sound like I'm guilty already…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows? Maybe you'll feel better if you throw up, yourself." "Omitting the vomiting part for now, it's really not like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Keiki tried to tell them that they were jumping to conclusions, their doubtful stares didn't soften in the slightest. This part of the cafe had completely turned into an interrogation room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-I get it. Then, let's just assume that Nagase-san holds a certain level of affection, or even more, towards Keiki-kun, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It makes sense. If she holds romantic feelings for Keiki-senpai, then of course she would be angry about the bunny girl incident."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika agreed with Sayuki's hypothesis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, if it's a boy you like, you'd hate if he was surrounded by other girls," said Mizuha in return.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I'd get pissed if the boy I had feelings for was being lovey-dovey with some other girl during club activities. If it's like that, it would make sense that she would try to abolish the club."</p>
<p class="null-p">And Mao gave their suspicions the final push to give a reason that would explain Airi's actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that really is the case, then I can't accept it. Keiki's lover has to be a boy." "You don't have to worry. I don't plan on getting a boyfriend, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki had already given this possibility some thought. After the sports festival, before the bunny girl incident, he could feel that her affection for him had been growing. So much so that the man-hating Airi invited him into the student council herself. If he was to assume that she held romantic feelings for him, then all of her actions would make sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">This might actually be Keiki's chance to finally get a cute girlfriend like Shouma had managed to do recently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! Keiki-kun was grinning just now?!" "Keiki-senpai?! What's so good about this girl?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu… You're the worst…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san? You're not allowed to cheat, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You guys really just always say whatever you want…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This is what he got for having rosy fantasies. He had completely forgotten about it, but there was a condition that Keiki had to clear before he could get himself a lover. Even if he managed to score a cute girlfriend in the foreseeable future, the perverts from the calligraphy club certainly wouldn't let that stand. In order to prevent this from happening, he came up with the 'De-perversion plan', but he hadn't made any great progress on that as of yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My school life is really looking grim right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, Keiki decided to focus on the problem at hand, namely Nagase Airi's supervision. Everyone's stress would be reaching the breaking point soon, so if the situation continued like this, it would only be a matter of time until someone was unable to hold back, and they would leak their perverted desires.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, what should I do about this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's investigation, and the other girls showing no signs of progress towards rehabilitation… so many things were floating around inside Keiki's head. So in order to prevent his brain from bursting right then and there, he decided to briefly forget about everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work today… Huh? Nobody's here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the day after their emergency meeting in the cafe. When Keiki made his way to the clubroom, he was greeted by absolute silence. The window was open, and two bags were lying on a chair, so someone must have been here earlier, but he didn't see anyone there now. Keiki guessed that they had probably gone to buy some drinks, or gone to the toilet. For now, he decided to put down his own bag and sit down on an empty chair. When he gazed out</p>
<p class="null-p">of the window, he felt a chill running down his spine. "Achoo! Ugh… It's a bit cold today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His body twitched from the cold, and he dug out his tissue pack to clean his nose. And that tissue just so happened to be the last one from the pack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was the last one, huh…? Maybe we have some tissues in the lockers."</p>
<p class="null-p">Various supplies were often stored in the lockers. From club-related materials, to everyday necessities.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, it happened as he stood up from his chair to open the locker. "……Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the locker was the all-too familiar Nagase-san. "Uwaaaaaaaaaah?! N-Nagase-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Psst! You're too loud! People will come looking!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl with flax-colored twintails, and the first-year uniform. "So what exactly are you doing here, Nagase-san?" "That's… Umm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi averted her gaze awkwardly. Just then, they heard voices coming from outside the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-The school vending machines are so far away. They should at least put one or two in the clubroom building."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Yuika thinks it's the perfect distance for the Witch-senpai who obviously needs more exercise."</p>
<p class="null-p">They heard the voice of Sayuki, complaining about the location of the vending machines, and Yuika, who was taking this opportunity to throw jabs at her. But before Keiki could turn to greet them, as their footsteps were quickly approaching-</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good! Kiryuu-senpai, hurry inside!" "Eh? ….Uwah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His arm was grabbed by his Kouhai, and he was pulled into the locker. There wasn't any opportunity for him to resist, and Airi immediately closed the locker door. Just when they had finished hiding their bodies, the door to the clubroom opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh, it looks like nobody is here yet." "But there's another bag there, see?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. They probably went to the toilet."</p>
<p class="null-p">While holding this conversation, they both sat down on their respective chairs and started sipping on the packs of juice in their hands. Still not knowing exactly what was going on, Keiki separated his face from the locker door and quietly whispered to Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And why do I have to hide as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I left Senpai there, you'd definitely tell them about me. Just keep quiet for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but this position is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were trapped in a very tight space right now. In their current position, they were practically glued to each other, almost like they were hugging each other, and the soft feeling on his right hand might possibly have been her thigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey?! Where are you touching me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't help it in this tight space, can I?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuugh… This is the worst. Why did this have to happen…?" "No, that's totally what I wanted to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that they had ended up like this, they had no other choice but to hide</p>
<p class="null-p">until Sayuki and Yuika left the room again. If they saw Keiki in such a position, they would without a doubt call for a trial. While a chill run up Keiki's spine from imagining that, Airi also started fidgeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… your breath hitting me is very uncomfortable, so could you stop breathing please?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's way too unreasonable!" "Ah, idiot! You're too loud!" "Ah, I just happened to…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He hurriedly closed his mouth, and he checked outside the locker through the small slits in the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh? Did I just hear a voice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Yuika didn't hear anything, though." "Weird… Maybe I misheard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai, are you going deaf at your age?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san really is a cheeky girl. Why can't you be a bit more lovable? Really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika just doesn't have any love to spare for Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been worried that he had sealed his fate, but his outburst was actually just a trigger for another fight between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai too. Haven't you gotten a bit too energetic recently? You're constantly pushing your chest against Keiki-senpai… You're so arrogant just because you have a big chest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like having a big chest is a problem, you know? Also, Keiki-kun likes them big, doesn't he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that really the case? Just recently, Keiki-senpai praised Yuika by saying 'It's actually exciting because it feels like I'm doing something immoral'."</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Airi's facial expression changed. She looked like she was looking at human trash.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong, okay? I just wanted to tell her that size isn't everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that big breasts are magnificent, but small ones have their own wonderful appeal. And while Keiki was busy having a mental philosophical debate about it, the exchange between Yuika and Sayuki continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, the point is that even Yuika's chest has its own value." "Hmph, the howling of a loser."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did you just snort at Yuika?! Are you making a fool out of me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you have that much of a complex about it, then do you want me to teach you a way to make them bigger?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?! …N-No, this must be a trap."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's out of pure goodwill. In as much as the size of their d*cks is a delicate topic for boys, the breasts are the same for us girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her Kohau squint her eyes, the Senpai gently smiled at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"See, they say that they will grow bigger if you keep fondling them at a young age."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika was an idiot for getting her hopes up! As if something like that would actually have any results!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, you never know unless you try. -That being said, I will be the one who does the fondling today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? --Hey, wha-?! Hyaaan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A second later, sweet, tempting groans came from Yuika's mouth. Sayuki, who had gotten up to stand behind her Kouhai, was now copping a feel of Yuika's chest with both of her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Witch-senpai?! Y-You can't… Ahnn?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, so you let out such a cute voice if you feel good, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika tried to resist, but she couldn't win in terms of strength since her enemy was Sayuki. In the end, the blonde-haired girl had completely been done in by the perverted female molester.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a wonderful sight to behold…</p>
<p class="null-p">A beauty fondling another beauty's chest was like a gift sent from the heavens. It was like he was watching something he shouldn't, and that got his heart racing. But since Yuika's reactions were too lively, he couldn't keep watching. He returned his gaze to the inside of the locker, only to spot a red- faced Airi, who was watching the scene happening in awe.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Awawawawa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was letting out sounds that couldn't be explained with human language, and her body was shaking violently, but Keiki didn't know if that was because of anger or excitement. Maybe the impact of this scene was too much for her serious personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Really! Will you give it a rest already?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. Because Koga-san's reactions were so cute, I got a little too into it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Witch-senpai, do you swing that way?" "How rude. I like boys."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika threw doubtful eyes at Sayuki, but she camly denied her suspicions. Thus, the service time ended.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they drank the rest of their juice and left the room. Keiki and Airi certainly wouldn't let this chance go to waste, so they stepped out of the locker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I saw something amazing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right… But if there's no boys around, girls often do stuff like this." "I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki was really intrigued about that, there was still something left that he had to know.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, care to explain to me why you were hiding in the locker, Nagase- san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… so you didn't forget."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course not… Well, knowing Nagase-san, it was probably so that you could find proof of me being a bad influence or something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki voiced his suspicions as to her motive, Airi averted her eyes. There probably wasn't any perpetrator out there who was this easy to see through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's good that you're taking your job so seriously, but isn't this taking it a bit too far?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiding in a locker like this is a bit questionable, don't you think?" "Uuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, it's not really fair either." "Uuuuuuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started to approach her with logic. "I can't help it, can I?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she was driven into a corner by Keiki, Airi screamed out with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I agree that this was really weird! But I don't have any other way! After all… I-I can't allow Kiryuu-senpai to be together with the girls from the calligraphy club!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai, you idiot!" "Ah?! Nagase-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without listening to Keiki's plea, Airi stormed out of the clubroom. Left alone, Keiki could only stare at the open door, confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nagase-san hates it when I'm with the girls of the club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was jealousy the reason for that feeling of hatred? Considering that, the talk about Airi possibly having romantic feelings towards Keiki came to his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, she straight-up denied the possibility, but… "Is this possibly a flag for the 'Airi Route'…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, he received no answer. Even when he sent Airi an email, he received no reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, after classes ended. Keiki was sitting on a bench out in the courtyard, his mind wandering as he thought about what had happened recently. Of course, the main train of thought was about Airi. The picture of her profile as she stormed out of the classroom, close to tears, still wouldn't leave his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…She didn't come to the clubroom today, either… Maybe I said too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Up until now, he had aggravated Airi more than just once. But since the circumstances were so complex this time around, he couldn't quite grasp why she had reacted like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Hug~"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why being hugged from behind by the student council vice president might have been punishment sent from the heavens above.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Fujimoto-san, what are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to recharge my energy after all this time. Sniff sniff." "Don't just say that while enthusiastically sniffing me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He peeled off Ayano, who had been clinging to his back. The girl unexpectedly gave in and sat down next to him. And the one eye that wasn't hidden by her bangs was looking straight at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, you're looking a bit down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, well, I kinda got in a fight with Nagase-san… She's been coming to the student council still, right? Was she acting weird in some way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As far as I could tell, she was the same as always." "I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to worry. I don't think that Airi would start hating Kiryuu- kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi told me before that when she was in trouble, you came to save her." "Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then at the sports festival, Keiki had brought back Airi's panties that had been stolen by a stray cat. This incident was a trigger that helped Airi become closer to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Airi is bad with boys, this was the first time I've seen her talk with one like that. She was probably happy that you saved her back then, Kiryuu- kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why she probably couldn't let this stand. This harem life of yours." "Just so you know, I'm not living a harem life here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Ayano was also a fellow member of the student council with Airi, she probably heard a lot from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I see… So that's why Nagase-san was so angry back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was probably because Airi had trusted him. That was evidenced by the fact that she was the one who invited Keiki to the student council. Despite that,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki betrayed her trust. There was no honesty inside a boy who'd get attacked by four girls in bunny girl suits. Since her trust in him was probably pretty high, so was her pain after being betrayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi's got quite the bothersome personality," Ayano said. "Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once she opens up her heart, she's quite the cutie." "I know that myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I want you to make up with her. That will surely be of benefit to her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Ayano's kind and gentle smile warmed Keiki's heart. "I'll go talk to Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">At any rate, the problem wouldn't disappear on its own. He didn't know if he would be able to make up with her, but it boiled down to him accepting the challenge.</p>
<p class="null-p">After receiving word that Airi was currently in the student council office from Ayano, Keiki immediately went there to meet her. His information was correct, and the person in front of him was indeed Airi, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that she'd be taking a nap…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Entering the student council office, Keiki found Airi resting her head on the table, deep in the world of dreams. It seemed that the other student council members were out, probably doing their student council work. A laptop was running next to Airi, and the screen showed multiple pictures.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't these… pictures from the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki and Yuika brushing ink over paper, Mao and Mizuha conversing with</p>
<p class="null-p">each other, and many more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, she always has that camera with her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was always enthusiastically taking pictures whenever she was investigating the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But these pictures are a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's neck when she had her hair up in a ponytail, the moment when Yuika was biting on the straw of her juice, countless rather specific situations…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling that something was off, Keiki took a peek at the laptop. Shown on the dimly lit screen, there were lists of documents open, and Keiki spotted two that were labelled 'Sayuki' and 'Yuika'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are their names here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki lost against his curiosity, and he opened one up, only to regret it shortly after.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the clubroom, illuminated by the setting sun, Yuika let out soft groans, as her laid-bare chest was gently played with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyaauu?! Hmmm… Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, what a cute voice. I didn't think that Koga-san would let out such groans."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that in a happy manner, Sayuki continued to softly caress Yuika's chest from behind the girl's back. Both of them were only wearing shorts, and two bras, socks, and other clothes were scattered around the clubroom. Of course, the two of them were the only people in the room, with no other person to ruin their fun. Sayuki's gentle finger moments played with Yuika's modest chest, and cute moans continued to fill the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuah?! N-No more…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having reached her limit, Yuika let out a shriek. Finally freed from Sayuki's grasp, her legs gave in, and she collapsed onto the table. Hot, steamy breaths were escaping Yuika's mouth, and her normally white cheeks were the same color as the currently setting sun. But her watery eyes continued to gaze at Sayuki, seemingly in expectation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san… Is it really fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… Yuika will give her first to Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following this confession, Yuika slowly took off her white shorts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, such a good girl. As a reward-I'll give you a one-way ticket to the land of pleasure."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whispering these words in return, Sayuki followed suit and took off her shorts. She softly kissed Yuika's neck. And, running her fingers across her Kouhai's most important place, the forbidden pleasure continued-</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Attacked by a hideous headache, Keiki had to put one hand on his forehead. This story about forbidden love that was shown on the screen-it was a very lewd and indecent story of two naked girls playing with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So Nagase-san wrote such a perverted novel…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki only knew the serious Airi, this was a very scandalous revelation. These turns of events probably explained the rather unorthodox pictures that Keiki had seen before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm? Whooo?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it was in response to Keiki's voice, but Airi softly opened her eyes. "Ahh, good morning, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai?! Why are you… Wait, ahhhhh?! What are you looking at?!" "Nagase-san's laptop?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't just look at other people's laptops like that! How indecent!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The indecent one clearly is Nagase-san here! Just when I was worried that you weren't visiting the room, you were writing this lewd novel in the student council office! I really didn't expect that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's… Seeing the two of them like that in the clubroom… My inspiration wouldn't stop overflowing, so I just had to write it down…."</p>
<p class="null-p">This red-faced Kouhai in front of him somehow reminded him about the fujoshi he knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And don't say lewd novel! These are all sacred acts between two girls!" "Sacred acts…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that Airi's words grew more distorted by the second, a single possibility arrived in Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san… are you from that side of the street?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No?! I-I just like it when two girls are being lovey-dovey with each other! Just seeing that is more than enough! I don't want to be like that myself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't look at me with those doubtful eyes! I-It really isn't like that, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whether or not I think of you that way, the moment I saw this, I already categorized you as a pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A pervert?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was just a reverse Nanjou Mao, after all. All in all, she was nothing more than a yuri author.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then the reason why you wanted to disband the calligraphy club…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you right at the beginning, didn't I? I cannot allow your deviant hands to make the girls suffer, so I will save them. I cannot allow an adolescent boy like you to enjoy all these girls for yourself, and make them follow your desires."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a punchline…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason she had wanted to disband the calligraphy club wasn't because of romantic feelings for Keiki, and resulting jealousy, but rather because she couldn't stand the fact that the harem king Keiki was playing around with these pure girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But then why did you invite me to the student council? The student council is filled with girls too, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can prevent you from doing anything to them when you're right under my nose, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, so I'm still being treated like a dangerous creature…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The invitation had clearly been meant as a crime-prevention measure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway! Please don't tell anybody about this, okay?! I'm keeping this a secret from everyone in the student council as well!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if I could tell them about this dangerous work of yours."</p>
<p class="null-p">He could never tell Yuika and Sayuki that they had been used as models for a yuri novel. They probably wouldn't even believe him in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it's regrettable that my interests have been leaked to Keiki-senpai… Well, so be it. I had planned to call Senpai over soon myself, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki posed that question, Airi returned a smile as she nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually-I've found the trump card that will allow me to disband the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And Keiki would experience himself just how powerful said trump card actually was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around twenty minutes had passed after the pervert's reveal. Tokihara Sayuki was present inside the student council office, having being called over via a school-wide broadcast. Just like when Keiki had been dragged here, Takasaki Shiho was seated at the same place as before, with Airi next to her. Keiki and Sayuki were sitting to face them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So why am I being called here like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to worry. This will be over really quickly," Airi responded to Sayuki's question, "What we're here for is to talk about the future of the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, I would like you to have a look at this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, Airi put down two small papers on the desk. They both were about the size of a 10.000 yen bill.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is… A receipt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The receipt for the four bunny girl suits, which were bought with the club budget."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Checking the receipts in panic, Keiki saw that one was for a single bunny girl outfit back in June, while the other was for the three freshly bought outfits.</p>
<p class="null-p">The single suit was probably back when Yuika had first joined the club. "…Sayuki-senpai? What is this about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You're wrong, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look me in the eyes when you talk to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's upperclassman didn't dare to look him in the eyes. That alone was proof that what Airi was suspecting was the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And why do you even have that, Nagase-san? They were supposed to be hidden in the back of the case for materials."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just recently, I went through an audit for all the culture-related clubs, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, the one that was supposed to happen on the day of the bunny girl incident."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though a lot had happened back then, it seemed that Airi still came to check after the situation calmed down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At that time, I had Tokihara-senpai take out the receipts for club equipment, and I found those mixed in. She probably wanted to hide them in there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a blunder…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A beautiful self-destruction. So well-done that she wasn't able to find any excuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We cannot allow the precious club budget to be wasted on something like this. Shiho-senpai, I believe that this deserves a fitting punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmhmm, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Shiho, who had tried her best to protect the club, probably couldn't overlook this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This really calls for disbandment." "N-No way?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. The club budget is there to make the club activities prosper, and not to be wasted on bunny girl suits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't say anything against that reasoning."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two students from the calligraphy club arrived at the same conclusion. The story is over. There was nothing they could do now-</p>
<p class="null-p">That was how much pressure Airi's investigation had brought to the table, and Sayuki's actions truthfully were in the wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, let us report this to the advisor, and have them do what is necessary to disband the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second, Nagase-san!" "Kiryuu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though this was completely self-induced, the calligraphy club was an important place for Sayuki. The girl had tried her best to protect it after her treasured Senpais graduated. Since Keiki knew this, he couldn't just keep quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In this case, the fault clearly lies with us. But the calligraphy club is an irreplaceable place for Sayuki-senpai. I'll do something about the money, so can we not jump the gun here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Keiki was mostly just trying to look cool. But reality wouldn't be as kind as the young boy hoped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai is going to pay for this? These bunny girl suits were pretty expensive, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pretty expensive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"One of them cost around 20.000 yen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"20.000 yen?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he checked the receipts again, he saw that the total cost of all four was around 80.000 yen. Something a high school boy like him could never dream to afford.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What I ordered were specially made bunny suits of the highest quality. I thought I might as well go for the best when I ordered them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that weird obsession?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, since they had to specifically make the chest region of my bunny girl suit to order, it came out at an extra 5.000 yen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeey?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for the extra 5.000 was the girl's oversized chest. At this moment, Keiki really felt like punishing her for those lumps of meat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you could pay it back immediately, that would be a different story, but I don't see any reason why we should give you the chance to pay it back later, or in parts. That would be unfair towards the clubs who take their budget seriously."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi gave them no glimpse of hope in the first place. They had no grounds to negotiate, either. But the person who stretched out a helping hand was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Airi-chan? Wouldn't it be fine to give them a bit of time?" "Shiho-senpai?! What are you saying all of a sudden?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi couldn't believe her ears. Of course, the same was true of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that using the club budget for something like this cannot go unpunished, but Tokihara-san looks like she's reflecting on it. And Kiryuu- kun has been of great help to the student council recently as well, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi hesitated for a second, but let out a defeated sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I understand. I will give you a bit of time to pay back the budget." "Ooohh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having been given the grace that they needed, they both sighed in relief. "But you will only have until the end of this month to pay it back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was the beginning of October, they had about one month.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, Shiho-senpai, I think that the calligraphy club still needs some form of punishment. Without giving them a fitting penalty, we would be showing them favouritism."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, actually, I already gave some thought to that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Grinning, the student council president focused her gaze on the only boy present in the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As a penalty until the debt is repaid, Kiryuu-kun will be a temporary member of the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Keiki was sold as loan to the student council until their debt could be paid.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: That's why she can't part-time work</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the day after the calligraphy club leader's misuse of the club budget had been revealed. During the pleasantly warm and comforting lunch break, Keiki and Sayuki were together in the clubroom, going through various magazines with various part-time job offers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't really find a good job here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When the requirements are easy to fulfill, somebody takes it very quickly, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">The better the pay, and the easier the requirements, the more people will apply for said job, making it harder for latecomers to find a good one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, what about this one? You only have to talk to a person in a private room, and there's a daily pay of 50.000 yen. And only women will be accepted, it says."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is definitely one of those jobs you should never accept."</p>
<p class="null-p">It may sound good, but it wasn't. Mostly because it already reeked of those back-alley jobs that high school students, or people in general, should never get involved in. Especially the pay of 50.000 yen for just one day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't get tricked by those faulty job offers and search for serious ones, if you would. We only have about a month to pay this back, so the faster we find a job, the better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is it that only I have to search for a part-time job?" "Because Sayuki-senpai was the one who got us into this mess."</p>
<p class="null-p">After it was revealed that Sayuki had bought four very expensive bunny girl suits from the club budget, a club emergency meeting was held, and it was decided that everyone would be paying for their own bunny girl suit. Though</p>
<p class="null-p">20.000 yen was indeed a lot, every member except Sayuki had already paid their share.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha said that she used her savings of new year's money, Nanjou makes enough money from her doujinshi sales, and Yuika-chan got it from her father. Apparently she didn't even have to beg for it, and just got it immediately when she asked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't Koga-san spoiled a bit too much…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't you get your monthly allowance a bit earlier?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I already tried that, but since I got 2 month's worth of it before already, I can't get any more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then searching for a part-time job is the only possibility." "That's true. But to be honest, I really don't want to work…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I totally expected you to say that… If you can't repay the money, then the club will be disbanded, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu… I know that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His upperclassman puffed out her cheeks like a kid. Putting away the magazine in her hand, she rested her body on the table in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh… If only there was a wonderful, loving master who would give me endless money, who would put up with my dog roleplays and take me for a walk?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if there would be a person like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, I'm a girl that the calligraphy world has high hopes for, you know? Don't you think that it would just be a waste of talent if I had to work for almost nothing at a part-time job?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">If one were present, one might have heard the sound of a vein on Keiki's forehead popping. Calmly standing up from his seat, he walked over to the person who had aggravated him to this level.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it? What's with that scary face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, you don't seem to understand the position you're in right now." "Eh, Keiki-kun? …Wait, what are you-Hyaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Sayuki shrieked was because the approaching Kouhai had lifted her body up. With his arms under her armpits, Keiki sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Keiki-kun, what are you planning on doing?!" "This right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting his struggling upperclassman down on his lap, he decided to make her butt the target. He lifted his right hand and brought it straight down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment his hand landed on her butt, a loud 'Smack!' sound could be heard. Sayuki's face went bright red and she raised her voice because of the sudden punishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-kun?! W-What in the world are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, you ask-This is to discipline you, of course. Right heeeeeeeere!" "Hyaaaaaaaan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's still more!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-If you keep doing that, I'll… Yaaaaaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He brought down his palm against this cheeky girl's butt again and again. Every time she received a spank, a shriek escaped the girl's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is all because you misused the club budget, you know!? And what?! You're joking with me, right?! You don't want to work?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm sorryyyyyyyyyyyy!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not just your breasts, but your attitude is also way too oversized for your own good! Aren't you embarrassed to be a human?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That hurts?! I'm sorry! It's all my fault!" "Have you reflected on your actions?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I did! I did so please stop! I beg you! Do it more!" "Which is it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… Haaah… Having my butt spanked by Keiki… This is the best reward ever!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is why perverts are so… Ugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing that it wouldn't do either him or Sayuki any good if he kept going, Keiki stopped, and he made the girl on his lap stand up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? W-Why? Why did you stop?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I see absolutely no reason to make Sayuki-senpai happy like that." "No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki gave a cold response, Sayuki looked at him like a thrown-away puppy. Seeing that, Keiki gave an ominous grin, and said the following.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you want me to continue?" "Y-Yes! Please continue!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then work harder to find a job. Once you've worked hard enough to play back the club budget you wasted, I will reward you however you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably remembered the feeling of being spanked, because her cheeks turned a faint red, and her body started twitching. Once you give someone a taste of something good, they will work hard to receive it again. It's the same concept as training a pet. Make them remember the feeling of being rewarded, and they will work to achieve it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now what will you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yessss! I'll do my best to find a part-time job!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression full of ecstasy, the upperclassman swore to work her hardest. And shortly afterwards, Sayuki decided on a part-time job to apply for.</p>
<p class="null-p">Homeroom had ended, and Keiki picked up his bag and left the classroom. While walking down the hallway, he gazed at the scenery outside and let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to work for the student council now, huh…? I'm a bit nervous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're just temporary help, right? I don't think that you'll have to do much."</p>
<p class="null-p">The one giving an exasperated retort was the person who had left the classroom together with Keiki, Nanjou Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've already helped out with their work before, right? Why are you getting nervous after all this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're right about that. Thinking like that will make it easier for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh… I know I was the one that brought it up, but aren't you a bit too simplistic?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, Keiki had helped the student council out a few times already. From helping the uneasy Ayano carry equipment to a storehouse, to being forced by Airi to help sort documents. Thanks to that, he had become acquainted with Shiho, and had gotten her to give them a bit more time to repay the club budget that Sayuki had wasted. Wasting his energy worrying about that wouldn't do him any good.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, is the job search with club prez working out so far? I'm more worried about her than you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It should be fine. She told me during lunch break that she had found a good job offer, and she's going to go there soon for an interview."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… But that means that club activities will be on ice for a while, right?" "Ahhh… Yeah, once her job starts, that's what it'll boil down to, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">The club president will have her part-time job, and Keiki will be busy with student council work, so gathering the rest of the club members will likely be difficult.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, were there any male members of the student council?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? No, I don't think so. Fujimoto-san told me before that there weren't any."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… Just when I thought that I'd be able to get some new material." "What exactly are you hoping for…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My readers want to see something new, you know. I wanted to introduce a new male character soon, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter what you expect from me, I can't just make one appear." "Tch… Well, it's fine. I guess I'll work on my manuscript at home for the</p>
<p class="null-p">time being."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really want to cheer for you too much, but do your best." "Thank you. You too, with student council work."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao separated from Keiki with a wave, and Keiki stood there for a moment, seeing her off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess that our club activities are going to be off for a while, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though things weren't decided yet, that was probably what it would boil down to when Sayuki got her part-time job. Thinking that he wouldn't see the other club members for a while, Keiki felt a bit lonely-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, actually not as much as I thought I would be. After all, I'll be free from the perverts for a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was now actually looking forward to his student council work.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the third floor of the classroom building, in the deepest part of the hallway, he knocked on the door to the student council room. After receiving an answer and entering, he was greeted by three girls sitting around a table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, perfect timing. Over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho got up from her seat and waved Keiki over. When he moved towards her nervously, he saw Ayano waving her hand at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that you all know him already, but this is our temporary member who will be working here: Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Kiryuu Keiki. I will be in your care for a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki gave his greeting, the girls clapped. One of them, his Kouhai, glared at him, but he decided to ignore her for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kiryuu-kun? Us girls are all calling ourselves by our given names, so can we call you 'Keiki-kun' too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure, no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, Keiki-kun, this might be a bit sudden, but can you tell us about your hobbies?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hobbies? Umm… I like watching my little sister cook in the kitchen while she wears an apron."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he announced his hobby, all the girls present froze up. "I see, so Keiki-kun's a siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun is a boy, after all." "How dirty…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho said her words with a warm smile, Ayano nodded in acceptance, while Airi's eyes clearly scorned him as if he were trash while she muttered her response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah? Did I already mess up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with the calligraphy club, now even the student council knew that he was a siscon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess we'll introduce ourselves as well. I'm Takasaki Shiho, and as you know, I'm the student council president. I have a lot of hobbies, but my most favorite one is playing games."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that's a bit unexpected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, this Onee-san here is quite the gamer, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, the president is a proper gamer. She often plays on her PC while slacking off on her job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-can?! I have a lot of pride as the president, so can you not smash all</p>
<p class="null-p">of that in one second?! …O-Only when I have free time, okay?" "Another unexpected side of her~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, don't tease me like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho pouted and her cheeks turned a bit red. Seeing that childish side of her was actually quite infatuating for Keiki, but he of course kept that a secret.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway… Next is Ayano-chan, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the student council vice president, Fujimoto Ayano. My hobby is making sweets. And I love Kiryuu-kun's smell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm painfully aware of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, Ayano had a rather calm and composed personality, but she was a pervert who would get excited from a boy's smell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I cannot understand the reasoning behind Ayano-senpai's tastes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not exactly prohibited, but please keep the sniffing to a bare minimum during work hours, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, please prohibit it… Or rather, Takasaki-senpai also knows of Fujimoto- san's fetish, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've worked together for a long time, so of course I do."</p>
<p class="null-p">It made sense, seeing as how the student council president was good at seeing through people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Last is Airi-chan. If you would."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nagase Airi. I'm the treasurer. My hobbies are… Well, diverse."</p>
<p class="null-p">It made sense that she would hesitate from naming her hobbies. She wrote yuri novels, after all, all the while keeping them a secret.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We actually have another member, but they're home with a cold, so I'll introduce you later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmpf, please do your best as our errand boy." "Ahahaha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun's job is to help out the other members with their work, stand in for people when they're out, and other small things that you can do on your own."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-chan, can I ask you to show him the ropes? You're in the same year, so things will probably go a lot smoother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano nodded, accepting the job from the president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then Kiryuu-kun's seat will be next to Ayano-chan there." "Ah, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he sat down in the chair as he was told, Ayano immediately spoke to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't understand anything, feel free to ask me." "Yeah, will do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you do a good job, I'll tell you my three sizes." "Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm joking. Form aside, I don't have any confidence in my size."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So your confidence in your form is unwavering, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As always, Keiki had no idea how to handle Vice President Fujimoto. Her one eye hidden by her bangs, her smell fetish… Her existence was still riddled with mysteries.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun and Ayano-chan are pretty close, I see." "We often exchange our scents."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of explanation is that?! Fujimoto-san is always clinging to me on her own!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, just when I said that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing up from her seat, Ayano walked over and rubbed her cheek on Keiki's uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He says that, but he actually enjoys being hugged like this. Sniff sniff." "I would be if you weren't sniffing me all the time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai?" "Hyii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki heard a very agitated voice, he lifted up his head, only to see Airi looking at him with that gaze that could kill…</p>
<p class="null-p">"So as long as it's a girl, everyone is fine, then? You harem king." "Harem King?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't get any closer to Ayano-senpai! And Ayano-senpai, please treasure yourself a bit more! You're going to be eaten by this monster, you know?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi spoke, looking as if she was ready to declare war. Shiho watched over</p>
<p class="null-p">the situation with a troubled expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, my… It seems like this could get troublesome." "Kiryuu-kun, you haven't made up with Airi yet?" "It's quite the shame…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Make up? We haven't been close at all from the very beginning!" "Ahhh, those words really hurt…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her poisonous tongue was still as harmful of a weapon as ever. And sadly, Keiki wasn't a hardcore masochist like Sayuki, who would actually enjoy something like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm… But Airi-chan? You'll be working with him for a while, so you should make up with him, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Even if you say that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I know! In order to deepen your bonds, how about we have you check the equipment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to the president's proposal, their voices overlapped perfectly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around ten minutes later, Keiki and Airi were inside the equipment room, working on the mission they had received.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the worst… Why do I have to do this job with Kiryuu-senpai…" "Because Takasaki-senpai said so."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them really were on bad terms. Of course, though they were forced to hold conversation, it was sparse and awkward. They compared the stock with the checklist they had printed, checked the inventory for consumable goods, and checked to see if there was any damage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, this one goes over here, not over there." "Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those we have to dispose of. Just put them down at the entrance." "Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The newcomer to the student council was bossed around by his Kouhai. He was forced to bring out boxes, move old equipment… All in all it was quite the heavy work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Working in the student council requires quite a bit of physical strength, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Whether it be the sports festival, or the culture festival this month, we have to move a lot of equipment for the different events… In that sense, I'd be thankful if the manpower went up-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she could finish her sentence, Airi stopped herself with a "Huh?!" and closed her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I wouldn't be thankful in the slightest! We don't need any men!" "Yeah… I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then it's fine… Umm, next is the audio equipment… In there, I think…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Past Airi's gaze was a box, placed on the highest part of a shelf. Because of that, the girl went to bring a ladder, and reached out with her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmm~! …J-Just a bit more…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hand just barely wouldn't reach. She stood on her tiptoes and tried her best to grab it, but it was beyond the limit of her small stature.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me get it for you. That looks pretty tough for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you calling me tiny?! No thanks, I don't want your help!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Keiki chose the wrong words, but he got scolded in response. Though Keiki could see her reasoning, this was way too dangerous to ignore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a bit more… Woah, kyaaaaaa?!" "Ohhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she was about to touch it, she lost her footing. Airi let out a shriek at this rather predictable development, and since Keiki had anticipated the worst-case scenario already, he was in position to catch her falling body.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the position they ended up in was quite unfortunate… "Uwaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After catching the girl, he fell backwards onto the floor. He felt the cold, hard feeling of said floor on his back, and the soft feeling of Airi's butt on his belly, and he realized that she was currently sitting on top of him. Depending on how you looked at it, this might look like he was being pushed down by her, but Airi didn't pay that any mind when she finally returned to her senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Are you okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, somehow… What about you, Nagase-san?" "Y-Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I said I'd get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry… Because I declined your help…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl had a serious personality. She was probably frustrated that this had happened because of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, Nagase-san, the rumour that I'm building a harem in the calligraphy club really is a misunderstanding. I wasn't the one who forced them to wear bunny girl outfits, either. I'm not clever enough to that, nor am I good-looking enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, in all my sixteen years on this earth, I have never even gotten a girlfriend… Ahh, saying it out loud makes me even more sad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wondered why he was even opening his heart like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway! The rumour about me building up a harem is complete nonsense!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I know that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi muttered, as if she was having problems expressing herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've become stubborn. Seeing Senpai surrounded by girls made the blood rush to my head, so I consciously forced myself into that misunderstanding, and started feeling like I had gotten betrayed… Even though I should know that Kiryuu-senpai isn't a person like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I knew very well that the calligraphy club wasn't a bad place either. When she was in the clubroom, Koga-san really looked like she was having fun, after all. I never once saw her smile in the classroom, you know? That just shows how much she enjoys her time with you people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki felt happy hearing that. It was because he knew very well how Yuika used to be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But I still think that the part with the club budget wasn't a good thing." "That's… Yeah, I have to agree with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew very well how idiotic it was to buy bunny girl suits with the club budget.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so, the calligraphy club is a very important place for us. So once</p>
<p class="null-p">we pay off the debt, please stop your plans to disband it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Since the harem thing seemed to be nothing but a misunderstanding, once you pay back the debt, I'll give up on my plans."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… So, have we made up now?" "…Well, this should be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki stretched out his hand, the girl averted her gaze, but still shook it without complaining.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also…" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For while now, I've been able to see your panties." "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki made that comment, Airi lowered her gaze. The girl was still sitting on top of Keiki's belly, her skirt pushed up barely enough so that Keiki could see her thighs and her white panties. This time around, they weren't the childish panties like the ones the cat had stolen. Instead they were normal, cute white panties. Even Keiki couldn't hide his embarrassment any longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that these white panties suit you way better than those childish ones!" "You're the woooooooooooooooorssst!!!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Following that shriek, Keiki received a slap clean across the face. And thus, all of their progress towards making up was lost.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having been freed from his duties, the world outside had already gotten pitch-black by the time Keiki arrived home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than feeling exhausted from work, the constant pressure of his displeased Kouhai really played with his mental health. Wondering if he would be able to survive, seeing how his first day was already hell, Keiki opened the door to his home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, welcome back." "Yeah, I'm ba-ck?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What greeted the older brother was his bunny girl little sister. The breast portion of the costume was wide enough to show her breasts in their entirety, she had matching rabbit ears on her head, and there was a cute tail attached to her butt. Keiki had to admit that she was insanely cute, but the shock was too much for him nonetheless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why a bunny girl?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Earlier, you didn't get a good look at it because there were countless other beautiful girls around you, so I thought that I had to make my own appeal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so cute…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's heart skipped a beat because of her reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to declare to the whole world how cute my little sister is, Keiki thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, I wanted to be seen by Nii-san in this embarrassing costume." "I knew that the punchline was missing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had lost track of how many times he had gotten his hopes up only to be disappointed. It was definitely time to finally fix these distorted girls' fantasies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And how is it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mizuha leaned forward, the valley of her breasts became clearly visible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leaning forward is prohibited, Mizuha! It's morally and ethically unacceptable, okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki guessed that Mizuha would only lose against Sayuki when it came to size. Since she normally didn't show it when she was wearing clothes, her sex appeal was far too great when she was wearing revealing clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Nii-san, you like bunny girls, right?" "I love them!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you want to take some pictures?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I totally do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki, sixteen years old. A man honest about his own desires. To save this scene in front of him for later generations, he took out his smartphone and got ready to start taking pictures, when suddenly-</p>
<p class="null-p">As if on cue, his phone vibrated from an incoming email. "What's with that? It was just about to get fun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sender of the mail was Sayuki, and the contents were as follows: 'I got the OK at the job interview.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming interested as well, the bunny girl Mizuha lined up next to Keiki and peeked at his screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai. She got a job apparently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? That's good news."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, like this, she'll be able to repay her own share as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">With this, they could avoid the disbandment of the calligraphy club. And while Keiki was feeling relieved, another email came in from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">'I'll do my best at the job, so spank my butt again sometime, okay?'</p>
<p class="null-p">With this dangerously easy-to-misinterpret content, the atmosphere in the room took a complete 180-degree turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're fine with only eating raw eggs and rice for dinner today, right?" "Of course. No complaints from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">His little sister was still displeased for a bit after changing into her casual clothes, and during the preparations for dinner, but the raw eggs with rice were still delicious. Still, the fact that he couldn't snap a picture of the bunny girl Mizuha was more frustrating to him than seeing Mizuha eat her homemade hamburgers without giving him any.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was lunch break on Friday. Keiki and Yuika could be seen sitting behind the counter in the library. Though they were on duty today, not many library patrons were present, so they could talk about whatever came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, were you sold to the student council?" "Sold… Well, something like that, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's it like in there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… Well, they're all worthy representatives of the student council, and they take their jobs seriously."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not what Yuika meant. She was referring to the personal relationships."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Personal relationships?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both the student council president and vice president are girls, and there's also Nagase-san in there, so the student council is filled with girls, right? If Yuika thinks that Senpai is chasing after another girl, she won't be able to sleep at night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That in itself sends shivers down my spine, though…" "Anyway, don't listen to those girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's impossible." "Muu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Displeased, Yuika puffed out her cheeks. Her angry appearance was also pretty cute, and Keiki thought about how unfair that was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yuika understands. We cannot help this for now, but come back soon, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come back soon, and swear your allegiance to Yuika." "That ain't happenin', chief."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wouldn't fall for that kind of trap anymore. No matter how cute she was, her only desire was to make him her slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, I received an email from Witch-senpai. Since she found a job, the club activities will be on ice for a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If she doesn't cough up the money, the club will get disbanded, after all. We have to make her work hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. But still…" "…Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika gave a slight smile in response, seeming to try to cover up her muttering. But he did notice the lonely expression that flashed across her face for a moment. He was interested in her feelings, but he knew that she was hiding her true intentions because she didn't want to be confronted about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wished that she would honestly talk about her troubles, but if the person herself didn't want to, there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah, it's Kiryuu-senpai." "Hmm? Ah, Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki raised his head after hearing his name called, he saw Airi standing in front of the counter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you come here on behalf of the student council?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I had some business here myself… I would like to return this." "Ahh, understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">After scanning the barcode, he started the work for returning of the book, and went to take it back to the corresponding bookshelf. By the way, the book that Airi had returned was titled 'Learning the ropes: Yuri'. Keiki decided to ignore it, however, and not question why the school library even had</p>
<p class="null-p">something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll be excusing myself." "-U-Uhm, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was about to turn around and walk away when Yuika suddenly stopped her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you have some time right now? There's something that Yuika would like to talk about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With me? I don't mind, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi looked over at Keiki, clearly not having expected this development, but he didn't know what Yuika wanted to talk about, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai. Yuika is sorry, but can you take care of the counter for a bit?" "A-Ahh… Yeah, sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving Keiki behind, Yuika took Airi with her towards the storage room. At first, he obediently listened to Yuika's request, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I really want to know what they're talking about."</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't contain his curiosity. Seeing Yuika call out to Airi like that seemed a bit off to him. And Yuika also looked a big agitated, so he was worried what she might be doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, guess I'll go check things out over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">There weren't any patrons present in the library right now, so he figured that leaving his post for a bit wouldn't hurt anyone. Thus, he made his way towards where the two girls had headed to. When he arrived, he slightly opened up the door to the storage room, barely enough to be able to hear the girls' conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what did you want to talk about?" "Yuika has a request for Nagase-san." "A request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please stop your plans to disband the calligraphy club." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The part about wasting the club budget is entirely our fault. But the part about Keiki-senpai trying to build up a harem is nothing more than a groundless rumour. Keiki-senpai isn't the kind of person who would do that, and this bunny girl incident only happened because of Yuika and the others."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika spoke in a far more serious tone than Keiki had ever heard her use.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, once the debt is repaid, Yuika wants you to stop your plans to disband the calligraphy club. For her, the calligraphy club is a very important place, and she doesn't want to lose that."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuika was finished with her request, she looked like she was close to tears. Keiki felt so happy because of her words that his chest felt warm.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see… so that's why she had that sad expression on her face before…</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably was lonely already just because of the current club break. That just showed how precious the time was to her. And Airi seemed to think the same, because her cheeks loosened into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why are laughing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm sorry. It's just that Kiryuu-senpai told me the exact same thing." "Keiki-senpai did?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. And my response will be the same. Since I had the wrong idea about</p>
<p class="null-p">him, my plans will end when the debt is repaid fully." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I promise." "…Thank God."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their negotiations ended, and Yuika let out a relieved sigh. Seeing that, Airi showed a kind expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Koga-san. I also want to ask something of you." "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm, you see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fidgeting, Airi voiced her request. "Can you become friends with me?" "Eh? No thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was clearly not expecting to be flat-out rejected like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Yuika-chan is always on her guard, after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew it well, since he had experienced it firsthand. Mentally giving his regards to Airi, he stepped away from the door. He hurried back to the counter, and Yuika and Airi soon followed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's expression was like a blue sky without a single cloud in it, while Airi looked like she had seen a ghost.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? Keiki-senpai, why are you grinning like that?" "No reason at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika certainly didn't plan on telling anybody about her discussion with Airi. And nobody except Keiki would know how lonely she felt during this break from the club. That was why he decided to forever remember her feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until the debt of the club budget would be paid back, Keiki had to work as a temporary member of the student council. That was the condition that they had agreed to in exchange for Keiki and the others having extra time to pay it back. So in order to prevent the disbanding of the calligraphy club, Keiki was once more making his way to the student council today. And thus started the second day of his temporary work there.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he knocked on the door, he received a calm "Come in" in response. In this country, if you heard a 'Come in' after knocking on a door, that was considered permission to open the door. However, as soon as Keiki did exactly that, a voice filled with regret said "Oh, oops…" in response. What greeted Keiki was the sight of a girl, currently in the middle of changing-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, a man?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The cute girl with short hair turned and stared when Keiki made his sudden appearance. Her height seemed to be a bit shorter than Ayano's. She was wearing a green skirt, and was just about to put on a blouse. She had both of her hands on the buttons of said blouse as she froze in place. Thanks to that, through the slight opening of the blouse, Keiki could see her cute, white navel.</p>
<p class="null-p">W-What kind of charming navel is that?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki was charmed by the girl for a second, he didn't have the leisure to admire her bellybutton for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry?! I didn't think you'd be in the middle of changing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't mind it. It's my fault for changing in a place like this. I'll be done soon, so please wait a moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">(T/N: She uses the personal pronoun 'Boku' which is usually only used by boys.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Flashing a flustered smile, the girl finished buttoning up her blouse. After that, she picked up the blazer hanging on the chair next to her and put it on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe, sorry for making you wait like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry about it. I got to see your cute navel, after all." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl showed an astonished expression at first, but soon she started giggling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, thank you very much. This is the first time someone has ever praised my navel like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she had been seen while changing, the girl showed no signs of being angry, and instead showed a heartfelt grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, do you have some business with the student council?" "Ahhh, actually I'm-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when he was about to explain the circumstances, the door opened, and Shiho made her appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? So the two of you are here already. Good work~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Greeting the two with a smile, she focused her gaze on the mysterious girl. "Rin-chan, is your cold better now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! I'm completely better now! And who might this person be…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah this is your first time meeting him, isn't it? There are some circumstances, you see. This is Kiryuu Keiki-kun, and he's a temporary member of the student council. He'll be helping us with our work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that's how it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl that the president had called Rin-chan nodded in satisfaction, and she once more turned to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Mitani Rin, and I'm a first year. I'm the secretary of the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice to meet you. I'm a second-year, Kiryuu Keiki."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu… Are you the one who's trying to build a harem in the calligraphy club?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That Kiryuu might look like me, but the harem thing is a misunderstanding, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? Then what about the story about how Senpai forced the girls to wear bunny girl costumes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"False alarm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. A false alarm, huh? Rumours really can't be relied on after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl immediately believed Keiki, while Airi never had until the very end. Unlike the twintails girl, Rin seemed to have a rather upfront personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what's Senpai's hobby? Do you listen to music often? What about sports? Can I ask about your favorite type of girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ummmmmm…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Keiki started to feel relieved, a storm of questions came rushing in. Bringing her small-statured body closer, Rin looked like she was honestly interested in Keiki. This was her first meeting with him, a member of the opposite sex, and at this distance…</p>
<p class="null-p">She must be one of those! Those communication monsters I've heard about in rumours!</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone with the skills to immediately find a topic or common ground with another person. Realizing that he had such a person, the complete opposite of himself, in front of him right now, Keiki looked over at Shiho as he started to answer the various questions. Shiho was simply watching over the situation with a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ahh, I know. Can I call Kiryuu-senpai 'Keikun-senpai?'" "Keikun-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like to give new people I meet nicknames. By the way, Shiho-senpai's nickname is 'Shiichan-senpai', and Ayano-senpai's nickname is 'Ayanon- senpai'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why I'm Keikun-senpai…" "Is that… a no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yay! Then, feel free to call me 'Rin-chan'!" "That's a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki would feel a bit embarrassed with that intimate way of addressing her, he decided on 'Mitani-san' for the time being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keikun-senpai, I'm looking forward to working with you!" "Yeah. Likewise, Mitani-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, Keiki was a bit worried because of her energetic mannerisms, but after talking to her for a bit, he was relieved to find that it looked like he could get along with her. Shortly afterwards, Ayano and Airi also arrived at the student council room, and every member was present.</p>
<p class="null-p">The considerate Onee-san type student council president. The docile and earnest vice president.</p>
<p class="null-p">The strict, man-hating treasurer. The mood-maker secretary.</p>
<p class="null-p">And of course the temporary member, Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, it feels like the student council office has gotten quite lively."</p>
<p class="null-p">The student council president said this in a happy tone of voice, and their</p>
<p class="null-p">work for the day began. During events or meetings it was always hectic, but the normal jobs for the student council were rather repetitive, working with various text documents and so on. Keiki's job today was to classify the countless income ‐ expenditure documents, and reorganize the affiliated files. A very important job for keeping an eye on the overall budget for the school, and to check how specifically the money is being used.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, are you done yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Fujimoto-san, I'm close to finished here." "That was quite a lot though. Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might actually be good at these plain and simple tasks." Keiki might actually be a good fit for administration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Having you here really helps us a lot, Kiryuu-kun. We have to prepare for the culture festival too, so we're extremely busy these days."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it, the culture festival is this month."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the school's biggest event in October. The student council would head up the preparations, so they seemed to be working towards that already. And although Ayano said that it was "Just a bit" of stress, he could tell that she was downplaying it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If there's anything I can help with, go ahead and ask me, okay?" "Yeah, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">If he was going to work anyway, he wanted to be of help. He wanted to lessen Ayano's workload, since she was always working so diligently.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they worked for a little while longer, Shiho looked at the clock and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's about time. Let's end it here for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? Isn't it still pretty early?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The clock was saying that it was a bit past 7pm. That was one hour earlier than yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, now that Rin-chan is back, we're finally complete again, so I thought that we should have Keiki-kun's welcome party."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome party?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you've become a comrade to us, I think it'd be good to strengthen our bonds," said Shiho with a wink.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Keiki's welcome party started. "Now that the initial parts are done… Cheers!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The members of the club president were currently gathered in a nearby family restaurant. Having finished ordering their food, they prepared their drinks from the drink bar. Facing Keiki at the table was Shiho, Rin, Airi-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uhm, Fujimoto-san, aren't you a bit too close?" "Ayano-san is Kiryuu-kun's Senpai at work, after all." "That doesn't have anything to do with this, though!" "I can charge up from Kiryuu-kun's smell this way!" "What's the benefit for me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-senpai, please don't talk about a man's odor inside a restaurant like this. We are members of the student council, so please keep your morals in check when we are outside."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi scolded the perverted vice president. Rather than a student council member, she probably was a better fit for the public morals committee.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Still, the outfits from this restaurant here are really cute. I really wish that</p>
<p class="null-p">Koga-san could try them on, because that would give me a lot of progress… Ahh, I shouldn't. Imagining her half-naked got me all excited…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did your public morals go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the fantasies of the yuri author, the passing waitress was turned into a half- naked Yuika. Was this girl even remotely trying to hide her secret?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, how long are you planning on clinging to me?" "For all eternity."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Forever?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano, while talking about eternity and whatnot, and Keiki, who was clearly not enjoying the situation, were being watched by Rin, biting on the straw to her drink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keikun-senpai and Ayanon-senpai really are close." "Eh, does it look like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, seeing you be all lovey-dovey like this, it's like you're a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than a lover, I feel like one of those air fresheners you'd use in your home…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The two of you have known each other for a while, right? What was your first encounter like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With expectant, sparkling eyes, Rin asked the question, and Ayano answered. "Actually, a while ago, Kiryuu-kun saved me when I fell down the stairs." "Fujimoto-san tripped while carrying printouts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And then, Kiryuu-kun caught me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And as a result of that, Fujimoto-san became interested in my smell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So a shoujo-manga-like development like that occurred! Wonderful!" "How is that wonderful?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saving a girl like that might really be a manga-like situation, but everything that followed was way too surreal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, enough about us… Mitani-san, do you have any hobbies or anything like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess my hobby is to dress up. Like deciding on cute clothes and trying them on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, I can totally see that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rin-chan is very informed when it comes to western clothes, so I often ask her for advice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's very girly, alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">The other members from the club also sometimes talked about this. "…Still, the food is really taking its time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty full in here, so we can't really help it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi grumbled like an empty stomach, and Shiho replied to her. The food still hadn't arrived by the time their drinks were empty, so Airi got up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shiho-senpai, Ayano-senpai, what do you want to drink? I'll go get you something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then, I'll take some iced coffee." "Ayano-san wants cola."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Iced coffee and cola."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I want some ice tea!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah? Mitani-san will have to get it herself, of course." "It figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being rejected in a cold manner, Rin looked after Airi with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are the two of you not on good terms?" "Ahahaha, I do want to repair it, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Airi was supposed to be kind to girls, her attitude towards Rin was kind of unexpected. That being said, she also wasn't on good terms with Sayuki or Yuika either, so he gave up on thinking to deeply into it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I would like to be on good terms with Keikun-senpai." "Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eheheh, thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">His newfound Kouhai gave him a kind, glad smile. If he had Kouhais like that, then the student council might not be so bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-You seem to be having a good time here, aren't you, Keiki-kun?" "Eh? …Wait, Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he turned around after an ice-cold voice called out to him, he found Sayuki standing there, wearing the same uniform as the other waitresses. Though the level of promiscuity wasn't as bad as the maid or bunny girl outfits she had worn before, the clean design also really suited her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Senpai here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because this is the place where I'm working part-time, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that you got a job, but I didn't think that it would be here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, but I can't really go into detail, since I'm on work hours right now - Who might have ordered the shrimp and rice au gratin?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's me~" "Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki took out the ordered food from the cart she was pushing, and put it down on the table. After that was Shiho's pilaf topped with bechamel, and Airi's fish munière. Following that was Rin's napolitan, and Ayano's BLT sandwich.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-san is working hard, I see. Good, good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, I'll get a reward from Keiki-kun if I pay off the rest of the debt, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Declaring that, Sayuki brought out Keiki's hamburger menu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for waiting. This is your hamburger menu. The iron plate is pretty hot, so please be careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that was everything, then please enjoy your meal~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Finishing her perfect customer service, Sayuki returned back to the kitchen. "I was a bit worried at first, but seems like things will turn out all right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although this was supposed to be her first job, Keiki thought that she was doing pretty well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this rate, paying back the debt will be smooth sai-" "-Kyaaaaaaaaaa?! Tokihara-san, what are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Owaaaaah! Blood coming out like a fountain?!" "-I'm soryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the depths of the store, bloodcurdling screams could be heard. "-Ling?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Paying back the debt of Sayuki's fraud was a necessary condition to stop the calligraphy club from getting disbanded. In order to achieve that, having Sayuki work to pay her own share was an essential part, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Will she get fired before she can make enough money, I wonder?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, while Keiki watched her work, he saw her make several mistakes that could get her fired immediately. For example, she mixed up several orders and poured a drink over a (bald) guest's head. It made Keiki think the skills she had showed at first were nothing more than beginner's luck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like I really have to do something about this…"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: The working female molester and loving pervert</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's do some training."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a Saturday morning, and Keiki said this to Sayuki, whom he had called over to his house. It may have sounded like drastic words coming from his mouth, but the dire situation required some dire countermeasures.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this rate, you'll get fired before they give you any pay." "Yes, that's what I think, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">His upperclassman showed deep understanding in response to his remark.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since today was a school-free day, the girl was wearing a blouse and a long skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think that I would be this much of a klutz. After what happened, the manger really had a troubled expression on his face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel sorry for him…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That just showed how unsatisfactory the girl's job had been so far. If she were to continue like Keiki had seen her yesterday, she would without a doubt be fired today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, this is the part-time job you finally found. We have to make sure that you can keep doing it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll do my best! To stop the disbandment of the club! And also to get a</p>
<p class="null-p">spanking from Keiki-kun again!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you manage to pay back the debt, I'll do that as much as you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had no other cards left to play at this point but to lure her in with a reward like that. Rather than rehabilitating her, stopping the disbandment of the club had a higher priority.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what kind of special training did you plan for today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see. Since Sayuki is responsible for customer service, you'll have to learn the menu by heart first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I already did that yesterday." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the restaurant's break room, I went through the menu and remembered everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it, you really were good at studying."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what you would expect from someone who always has top scores after exams.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then next are the greetings. The most basic thing in customer service."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sound really experienced. Have you ever worked part-time, Keiki- kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, I researched all of this yesterday on the internet." "Ehhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was a bit taken aback by Keiki's straightforwardness. She even had the nerve to ask "Is this really going to be okay?" with a worried expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Setting aside the source for my information for now, the greeting is indeed</p>
<p class="null-p">important."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's quite right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll take the role of the guest, so please greet me with a smile and an energetic voice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the special training started.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stepped out of the room and entered back in as a guest. "Welcome, Master~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wrong store!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, please punish this Sayuki who's always failing like this!" "You'd be fired the second you acted like that, you know?!" After a short break, take 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome! Thank you for your visit today!" "See? You can do it if you try."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her bow was perfect, and her smile inviting. The men around town would surely flock to this restaurant every day if they were served by such a beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like the greeting is okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At my home, I was taught to always be respectful when greeting other people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like this, customer service shouldn't be a problem, and neither is the menu… But why did it go south like that yesterday? You should be able to remember the different orders, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but, there's a lot of other things that I have to do. When the customers had an extra order, I started panicking, and my head just went blank…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could understand that. If you have to do a lot of things at the same time, you often panic, lose your focus, and forget what to do next. There were limits to the number of things that a human could do at once, and you couldn't conduct multiple actions at the same time. In the end, all that you can do is prioritize one thing and slowly get used to your work so that you can do things faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So basically, what Sayuki-senpai is lacking is experience."</p>
<p class="null-p">This was Sayuki's first part-time job. It should be fair to say that she didn't have any experience at all. Just like a video game hero who just left the starting village wouldn't be able to defeat the demon lord, a first-timer at a part-time job wouldn't be able to do everything perfectly from the get-go.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why fixing Sayuki's current mistakes had top priority. If she did this, the parts she was lacking in would disappear one after another until she had the confidence she needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you hurry up, you panic, and as a result, you make more mistakes. The most important thing is not to panic. To always keep a calm head. If you can do that, everything should be smooth sailing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand! In order to become a proper waitress, I have to have the mental strength to endure whatever shameful roleplay is bestowed upon me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… Wait? I wonder… It feels like we're talking past each other…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that that's decided, let's start! In order to achieve greater mental strength, another shameful roleplay-special training!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having some weird misunderstanding, Sayuki seemed to have misinterpreted the special training as some sort of sexual roleplay.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But thinking along those lines, it's true that for your part-time job, you have to swallow your own embarrassment no matter what…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If that were the case, then there might be some worth in trying. And it seemed like Sayuki was all up for it, since she was looking at Keiki with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's do some… Embarrassing things?" "Y-Yes… Umm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki nodded, he couldn't think of anything that would make sense to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, what should I even do to make Sayuki-senpai of all people embarrassed?!</p>
<p class="null-p">The only things he remembered were him pushing his hand into the valley of her breasts, fondling her butt outside, or forcing her to lift up her skirt when she was wearing no panties. She surely wouldn't get embarrassed from anything half-assed anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Wait a second. If that's the case, then how about I do all the things she did to me that made me embarrassed instead?</p>
<p class="null-p">The things that made Keiki's heart beat faster. He just had to turn those around and dish them right back at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The embarrassing things that Sayuki-senpai did to me were-</p>
<p class="null-p">When he searched through his memories, he found a high number of events that fit this description.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's upperclassman was clearly excited. Taking a step forward to close the</p>
<p class="null-p">distance between them, he suddenly kissed her on the cheek. This happened back soon after he had found the love letter from Cinderella, and on the day when they met the big, white dog after class, it was a surprise attack of hers. Keiki's heart wouldn't stop beating like crazy for the rest of the evening after being kissed like that by the Senpai he looked up to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Now then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki separated from the examinee to check her reaction, he found Sayuki, frozen stiff like a dog that had just been surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it, Senpai? Was that embarrassing?" "Hyawa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyawa?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't sure what the girl's sounds meant, but Sayuki's face went bright red and she flopped down onto the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What are you doing…" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was so happy that I almost wet myself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing a high school girl say that she almost peed herself out of excitement was too much of a shock for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Suddenly kissing me on the cheek like that… That is basically the same as saying 'I love you'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you certainly wouldn't do that with someone you're not on close terms with."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-And… Is this a 'I'll make you my pet' kind of 'I love you'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that was nothing more than part of our special training." "What a dry reaction! But I don't hate that either!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's crazy how easily masochists can stay positive throughout life." With this mental strength, any more training seemed unnecessary. "So, did that help you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see, I don't really get it, so can we do it one more time?" "Hey…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm joking. But, to think that I would receive such a reward from a surprise attack like that… Ah?! Reward?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… So that's what it was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was nodding to herself, only for her to suddenly raise her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I finally get it now! Just like a master gives his pet love, I just have to transmit this love over to the guests! This is my job as a waitress!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah? …Eh? Wait, what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In short, I just have to think of the guests as my cute pets!" "Ohhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a sparkling smile, she blurted out complete nonsense. "Then… How about we try that out for now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll do my best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't help but worry about this development, but the girl's job that</p>
<p class="null-p">day worked out perfectly, and she was even praised a lot by the manager. When Sayuki reported that to him, he could only click his tongue and think, Are you serious?</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">The student council office was equipped with a single desktop PC. It stood on a desk at the wall, and any student council member could use if needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki arrived at the office after classes had ended, Ayano was currently using it. Interested in what she was doing, he called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, what are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm checking the emails. It's my turn to check the comment box today." "Comment box?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who answered that wasn't Ayano, but Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know them, right? Students with wishes, opinions and so on can tell us them through that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I see… Wait? But why on the computer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We don't have a physical comment box standing around. On the school's homepage, they can go to an external site and send us their opinions through there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, so high-tech."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's a bit of an advice column. We decide on a person once a week who goes through the various emails and collects all the different wishes and opinions."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes sense. And Fujimoto-san is on duty today." Keiki thought that this actually sounded a bit interesting. "Fujimoto-san, can I have a look too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure. If you want, we can look at it while Ayano-san gives you a lap pillow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, sitting normally is best, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, the only people present right now were Keiki, Ayano and Shiho. The first years hadn't arrived yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Please add some quality steak to the cafeteria's menu.' "Yeah yeah. 'Not going to happen~', and done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So cruel?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since these things can be sent anonymously, many people just write whatever they want here. They're mostly just joking."</p>
<p class="null-p">This comment box was apparently developed to protect the anonymity of the sender. Though that was actually a good thing, it resulted in a lot of prank emails being sent.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when Ayano opened the last email, the girl's expression changed slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Fujimoto-san is hesitating?" "Yeah… This might be a bit difficult…" "Let me see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki peeked at the open email in front of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">'To the people from the student council, good day to you. To be frank, I just managed to get myself a younger boyfriend. And we promised that, after mid term exams, we would have our second date, but since this is my first actual lover, I'm a bit worried if I can actually take the lead, since I'm the older person. I feel like the first date also didn't go exactly as planned, so I don't</p>
<p class="null-p">want to make any mistakes this time around. That's why I was wondering if you kind people would be able to give me some wonderful date plans. I'm sorry for this rather personal request, but I hope for your support!'</p>
<p class="null-p">This email clearly contained a pure girl's feelings. "Ohh, that's quite the serious advice needed there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm not good with personal relationships, so I don't want to say anything bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that you can't just answer this haphazardly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Giving any bad tips would definitely leave a sour taste in the recipient's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But is this really the job of the student council?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not quite, but I want to help where I can. It's our job to work hard for the students of this school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though unconsciously, Keiki was a bit moved by that comment. "Then we have to do our best and think of a good date plan." "Yeah… But there's a problem right off the bat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have any experience with dates…" "That… Really is a problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">Giving romantic advice as someone without any experience at all is indeed not very helpful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I don't really have any experience either…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He actually had experience going on dates with the girls from the calligraphy club, but he felt like this would only bring up another problem, so he kept quiet about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about you just actually gain the experience?" "Takasaki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who threw them a life ring was the student council president, who he suddenly realized was standing next to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow is the anniversary of the day that this school was founded, so there's no classes, right? How about Keiki-kun and Ayano-chan go on a date together in order to come up with a good plan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they heard these words, Keiki's and Ayano's gazes met. "Going on a date…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus it was decided that they would go on a date together.</p>
<p class="null-p">That evening, Keiki finished his bath, and after returning to the room, he tried to think of a plan to make Ayano, and ultimately the girl with the request, happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A wonderful date plan, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Major places that they could visit were the movie theater, the aquarium, or the amusement park, but Keiki wasn't sure if this was what the girl who posed that request was really looking for. The only thing the email stated was that it was for a date with her younger boyfriend. Keiki really wanted to take away her nervousness so that she could safely take the lead as the older person in the relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A safe plan would be the best way to go about it, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">He just had to think of a place that would be good for a high schooler couple, with the least possibility of failure. This would enable the girl to make a good approach, and she could use that as a basis for a date plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, isn't that pretty difficult already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What even is a situation where you can make a good approach when you're the older person?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No good, I can't think of anything… Maybe something will come to mind if I put some milk into my brain."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a break from the plan-building, Keiki decided to get some milk, and so made his way downstairs to the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nnn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The light was off inside the presumably empty first floor. At the back end of the hallway, he heard noises coming from the dressing room, and the door was ajar, slightly illuminating the otherwise dark surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Light?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The only people in this house were the older brother, and the little sister. The two of them had already finished their daily bath, and Mizuha should have already returned to her room. And, even if she did come back down, not turning on the lights was very suspicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Don't tell me; is it a thief?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the possibility was slim, he couldn't completely deny it. And since the location was the changing room, the thief's goal could only be-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! Mizuha's panties are in danger!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to protect his beloved little sister's panties, he held his breath and slowly drew closer. When he quietly opened up the door just a crack to look in-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san… Nii-san… Nii-sannnnn…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He found his little sister, sitting down on the ground, wearing pajamas, as she rubbed her nose against her older brother's underwear. Her cheeks were coloured an intense red, and her expression was one of ecstasy as she was sniffing the underwear. Seeing that, Keiki couldn't hold back his surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… are you doing?" "Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she was called out to, the perpetrator's shoulders twitched as she turned around in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nii-san?! Since when were you-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just now… And just what are you doing there, Mizuha?" "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki asked her that with a wavering voice, her gaze returned to the item in her hands. And that right there was the perfect evidence for her actions that she had just conducted-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You're wrong! I-I just happened to, and I'm not doing that sort of thing all the time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san totally doesn't me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether he trusted her or not, the scene in front of him was reality. And said reality only proved her actions. There was no room for debate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that even Mizuha had a smell fetish…" "Y-You're wrong?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's not a smell fetish, then why were you sniffing my underwear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's?" "That… is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah? I'm waiting." "Uuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being driven into a corner by the unwavering questioning from her older brother, Mizuha gave up her resistance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If I smell your underwear like this… It feels like I'm hugging my beloved Nii-san… and that makes me… very happy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face went bright red from embarrassment, and it was easy to see that she was fighting to keep her tears down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though… I couldn't hold back… And… I just happened to…" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I'm sorry… That was so unexpected that I don't know what to say…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't become a bride anymore!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having received a fatal blow, Mizuha hid her beet red face with both her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, umm… I was a bit mean as well, so let's end this here. I'm not mad, and I won't blame you either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. But, I'd be happy if you don't do things like that anymore. You wouldn't like it if you caught me sniffing your underwear, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't mind!" "You wouldn't?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't let other people, but it'd be totally OK with it if it were Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're reaching the end of the line here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">An older brother sniffing his little sister's underwear seemed like it would be totally morally reprehensible to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'm also embarrassed. So I beg you to please refrain from doing that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeees."</p>
<p class="null-p">And like that, the siblings headed to the kitchen as if nothing had happened, got something to drink, and went back to their rooms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was now lying on his bed again, facing up, but his mind wasn't thinking about the date plan, but rather to the previous incident with Mizuha sniffing his boxers-</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that we'd arrive at this awkward stage…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Who would anticipate finding your own little sister doing that with your underwear?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It felt like she was being hugged, and that made her happy, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki deduced that smelling the odour of the person she loved made her happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Then is that the same for Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is she so obsessed with his smell because of more complicated feelings?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nah, that can't be it."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much he thought about it, he was totally jumping the gun here. In her case, she was only interested in the smell, not the person himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto Ayano had nothing more than a smell fetish, and she was only fixated on Kiryuu Keiki's smell. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I got here 10 minutes early."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the morning of the school-free day, the weather was perfect for the date, and Keiki arrived at the wide open space in front of the train station a bit before their time to meet up. The current time was about 8:50 am, and it looked like Ayano hadn't arrived yet. Since he still had some time, he decided to take a seat and wait, so he headed over to a nearby bench. Just to make sure, he checked to see if he had gotten an email from Ayano yet. By pure coincidence, a girl walked over towards him, and they met in front of the bench Keiki was originally aiming for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, Kiryuu-kun?" "…Eh? Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing his name being called out by a familiar voice, Keiki recognized the girl. Though her atmosphere seemed different than normal, upon closer inspection, one eye was hidden by her bangs, and the person wrapped in a pure white one-piece in front of him was without a doubt his date partner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Fujimoto-san. You're fast."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning. Kiryuu-kun too. I was surprised to see you here." "I would've felt bad for making you wait, so I came early."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too. I thought that coming late wouldn't be very good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I thought that I would wait for Fujimoto-san on this bench…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too. I planned to wait for Kiryuu-kun here…" "…Pfft."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them started laughing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We had the exact same thought, I see." "Yeah. We might actually be pretty similar."</p>
<p class="null-p">The date had already started with a bright mood. "Kiryuu-kun, I'm looking forward to today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, let's do our best to come up with a good date plan." "For now, I've come up with a general outline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, just what you would expect from an honor student. Let me see."</p>
<p class="null-p">She passed him a notebook, and on it he spotted various times, places that she had highlighted, and other neatly-written comments.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait wait wait?! That's way too detailed already!" "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you followed this strict schedule, there's no way you'd actually be able to enjoy it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than a date, this looked like a plan for a class trip. "But I have confidence in the final stage."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Final stage…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki glanced at the last part of her plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see I see. So for the final part of the date, we'll go to a hotel, and spend the night there-Hotel?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki unconsciously repeated himself. With cute, girly handwriting, it without a doubt read 'Go to a hotel together.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to spend the time together with Kiryuu-kun there until morning." "What would we be doing for all that time?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Work up a sweat, and then fall asleep while hugging you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A hugging pillow?! Ahhh?! That's why you planned on the batting center, bowling, and so on! It's only so I'll get sweaty, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That explained her mysterious wording 'Work up a sweat'. "Sorry, but that's a no-go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such a shame…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, to think you'd come up with all of this in one evening."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was happy that I got to go on a date with you, so I thought about it a lot." "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was unsure how to interpret those words, and when he looked at Ayano for conformation, she looked unexpectedly bashful.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Huh? I just realized this, but… doesn't Fujimoto-san look even cuter than usual…?</p>
<p class="null-p">The white one-piece really suited her, and her hair was combed even more neatly than usual. Inexperienced though he was, Keiki could swear that she had a light layer of makeup on. With this different-than-usual atmosphere, she felt more like a girl, and Keiki's heart started to beat faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">For her to dress up like this… Does she actually feel… that way about me?</p>
<p class="null-p">The doubt from the previous night came flying back to his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">No no no. It's a school-free day, so dressing up like this is completely normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki probably had gotten ahead of himself again. "…But what will we do if we don't use the plan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we have to leave the city anyway, so let's think about it while we're on the train."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, in order to pursue ideas for a good date, both of them went on their way.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, they decided on walking around the various dating spots they had respectively thought about.</p>
<p class="null-p">First up was Ayano's suggestion of "Talking about a date, the movie theatre is a guaranteed win." Keiki agreed that it was a good idea, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that it had bed scenes like that…" "That was a bit unexpected, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The movie they had decided upon had some rather radical bed scenes, which turned the mood of the date awkward. It was probably comparable to watching that sort of thing with your family at home. Even after leaving the movie theater, Ayano had taken a bit of distance from Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's really weird for Fujimoto-san to be this distant… are you being wary of me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, Kiryuu-kun is a man after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy that you see me as a man, but how about you stop hugging me if that's the case?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This and that are different."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your criteria are still a mystery to me… For now, let's remember that you have to be careful about what movie you choose for a date."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, after talking like this for a while, Ayano stopped distancing herself from Keiki, and they began walking next to each other again like normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, where are we going next?" "Umm… It should be right around here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They moved forward while Keiki checked something on a phone app, and- "Ahh, there it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">Down the street, near a corner, a cafe in a brick building entered their view. But said cafe was not just any cafe-</p>
<p class="null-p">"A cat cafe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san always has that hair accessory, after all, so I thought that you might like cats."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… I love them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's normally expressionless eyes showed a slight sparkle. That alone made it worth it for Keiki to have chosen this store.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Woah."</p>
<p class="null-p">When they entered, countless cats greeted them. They were probably used to being surrounded by humans, because when Keiki and Ayano sat down, the cats approached them enthusiastically even though they weren't holding any</p>
<p class="null-p">treats. "…Cute."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">With a kind smile adorning her face, Ayano started petting the cats. And they didn't leave Keiki alone either. One black cat jumped up on Keiki's lap and rubbed her cheek against him in a cute manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Ayano pouted and snuggled up next to Keiki. "Me too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you competing with a cat?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the only one who's allowed to snuggle up to Kiryuu-kun like that." "That's the first I've heard of this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the employees were already glancing over at them, Ayano didn't pay them any mind as she snuggled up against Keiki even more. It was like there was a big mother cat along with all the others. Though Keiki felt a bit embarrassed, it wasn't like she was sniffing him, so he decided against shoving her away.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Something like this should be fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today was their date as well, so he let her be. After that, the cake they had ordered arrived, and they played to their heart's content with the cats. They took pictures and enjoyed their time in the cat cafe to the fullest. And just a bit before they planned to leave the shop, while Keiki was busy fondling a cat's chin, he noticed that Ayano had her gaze fixed on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's nothing… I was just thinking that Kiryuu-kun also likes cats."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, the girl laughed. As if she was happy to have a shared interest with someone about something she liked.</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the store behind, the two of them pondered about their next destination as they walked through the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How was the cat cafe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was very fulfilling. And a wonderful experience… But…" Her gleeful expression grew a bit more clouded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was really fun, but I don't know if this will be a good date for the girl in the email…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place, Keiki decided on the cat cafe in order to make Ayano happy. He had no idea if the girl in the email would enjoy it as much as she had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's try to think a bit more about the client for our next stop." "Yeah. But we only know that she has a younger boyfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the battlefield, information was the difference between life or death, and it wasn't any different here. If they had really wanted to come up with a perfect plan, they would have needed more information about the client or said boyfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we're here already, we might as well do things that every couple would enjoy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For example?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see… Walking down the street while holding hands?" "Holding hands… makes one happy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you want to try?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? T-That's a bit… embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you cling to me all the time?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, that would make us look like a couple…" "It's a bit late for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's smell fetish was already well known within the student council, and they knew that, if she was clinging to Keiki, she was just 'recharging'. Shiho and Rin observed them with knowing smiles, while Airi glared at them like they were the scum of the earth. And it seemed like Sayuki was also wary of Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hugging is okay, but holding hands is embarrassing, huh…? Fujimoto-san really can be weird sometimes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A maiden's heart is more complicated than a novel." Keiki understood that very well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Oh? Isn't that Kei-kun over there?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While they were walking down the roadside, Keiki suddenly got called out by two beautiful older ladies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it really is Kei-kun. Heyho~" "Kei-chan, what a coincidence~" "Asahi-san? And Yuuhi-san too."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Akiyama Shouma's older twin sisters: Asahi and Yuuhi.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of them was the short-haired, easygoing, casually dressed Asahi. The other, Yuuhi, had long, beautiful hair and was wearing a long skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-kun, you're walking around with a different girl today, I see. Is that your girlfriend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say that in a way that makes me look like a playboy. This is just a friend from school."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't even give them a chance to start having another misunderstanding. At the same time, Ayano pulled on Keiki's sleeve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"These people… Are they Kiryuu-kun's ex-girlfriends?" "Yes, that's right~" Asahi said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'That's right' My ass. Don't make this more complicated than it is already, Asahi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way?! Even though you showered me with so much love that night! Kei- chan, you're so mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have absolutely no recollection of that happening. And Fujimoto-san, don't puff out your cheeks like that. That's also scary!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to quickly clear up any misunderstandings that were brewing, he introduced the twins to Ayano. After that was done, Ayano seemed to have regained her composure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, today is just a normal weekday, right? Our school has their commemoration day, so we don't have any classes, but what about you two? Don't you have university classes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We had some important business, so we left early." "Yeah yeah, we are skipping class~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're as free as always, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That aside, are you two on a date, Kei-kun?" "Well, there are some special circumstances…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki saw no reason to hide it, he explained the circumstances that had led up to their current date.</p>
<p class="null-p">About how Ayano was working as the student council vice president, about how Keiki ended up as a temporary member of said student council, and finally, about the love advice that they currently were having problems with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Because of that, we're here to come up with a good date plan. I'd be great if either of you could tell us anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A date plan, huh…? How about enjoying dinner in a restaurant with a great view?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think high schoolers like us can afford that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"if it were me, I'd eat some dinner and then go straight to a love hotel." "…I give up. These two won't be of any help, as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">The older sister lacked experience, which resulted in fantasies that were too ambitious. The younger sister was brimming with experience, but said experience wouldn't help much, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, then how about we ask a highschool couple?" "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Over there is a perfect couple you could ask for reference."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A perfect couple? …Wait, Shouma and Koharu?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi pointed at a normal cafe. Keiki spotted two people seated beside the window that had just recently started going out for real.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're actually tailing them while they're on their date." "What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki should have already been able to guess, the Akiyama twins were stalking their younger brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, don't tell me. Is that why you were skipping classes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, Koharu-chan is really small, so we were worried that Shou-kun might do something in the heat of the moment…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If he pulled Koharu-chan into a hotel, Shou-chan would get arrested…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of worry is that?! Koharu-senpai is legal, so Shouma won't get arrested!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it might not look like it, Ootori Koharu was actually a third-year high school student, therefore safe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what is it, Fujimoto-san?" "Behind you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Behind me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, he found that Shouma was standing behind him. "…And just what might you all be doing here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having been discovered by their target, the brocon twins' stalking came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the Akiyama twins went home, Keiki and Ayano ended up sitting at the same table as Shouma and Koharu. They had just finished explaining their circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So you want to ask us for a good date plan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel sorry about that. I didn't plan on bothering you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry about it. Unlike my older sisters, Keiki didn't do anything wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're as aggressive as ever, I see. Skipping classes to tail their younger brother like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">After being scolded by their younger brother, the twins immediately ran away. Still, they also seemed slightly happy to have been seen by Shouma, for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. It feels weird to be the victim now, after having been the stalker for all this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, Koharu-senpai is pretty experienced in that regard, isn't she?" "Experienced?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love makes people blind, Fujimoto-san." "?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano looked quizzically at Shouma after his puzzling statement. The cute Ootori Koharu was actually a veteran stalker, though she didn't look like it. Today, she was wearing what looked like a western dress with a bolero, making her look like some sort of rich lady, which she in fact was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had heard that her father was the owner of a rather famous construction company.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But being able to ask Koharu-senpai really helps a lot." "Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, the person with the request has a younger boyfriend, just like how Koharu-senpai has Shouma, so I thought that you might be able to help us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Then feel free to ask anything." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu looked like a goddess for a second, thanks to her gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, in my case, Shouma-kun is taking the lead most of the time, so it actually feels like he's the older one. Ehehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, the typical 'This won't help us at all' pattern."</p>
<p class="null-p">But seeing her happy like that made Keiki think that it wasn't too bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan can also be aggressive too, though. Just a while ago, when we were walking home from our date, she suddenly said 'Please hug me' out of the blue-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Shouma-kun?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu started panicking from that embarrassing reveal. While the loli's face turned beet red, the lolicon watched over her with a gentle smile. All the while, Ayano was observing them with distant eyes-</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"They're pretty close?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, they're already a couple." "Yeah… I'm a bit jealous, I guess." "Jealous?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-san here is also a girl, so I wish that I could get a wonderful boyfriend soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki did not expect that. He thought that she didn't have any interest in anything aside from people's body odours.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then what kind of boy does she like the most? …Maybe those that have a really intense smell?</p>
<p class="null-p">The image of a muscular boy with a bulky body sweaty from gym training came to his mind, sending a shiver down his spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the four of them tried to come up with a good date plan. They were forced to listen to Shouma rant and rave about how Koharu was the best girlfriend ever, and they talked about whatever came to mind. By the time they stepped out of the cafe, it was already two in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are the two of you going to walk around the city some more, Shouma?" "No, we planned to make our way to my house for a home date right now." "Ohhh, that sounds nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Home date…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like Ayano had never heard of the term. She tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to visit Shouma-kun's room, and we're going to spend some time</p>
<p class="null-p">together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So something like that is also a thing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing that explanation, Ayano's gaze turned towards Keiki. "Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… No, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked like she wanted to say something, but ultimately gave up in the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">After splitting up from Shouma and Koharu, Keiki and Ayano continued to wander through the city. They looked through the shopping mall, ate some delicious crepes together, and went through all of the different date situations that they could think of.</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, they were resting their feet on a bench in a nearby park. "That's what I'd do on a date. What do you think, Fujimoto-san?" "It was really fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All that's left is to compile the data and come up with a date plan." "Well, that's the most troublesome part."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like trying to catch a cloud. They had no idea what was interesting or important. Every couple had their own places they liked to visit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. When I get home, I'll figure something out." "…You're still going to work after all that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The word 'break' apparently didn't exist in her vocabulary. The things written in her sketchbook that Keiki had seen that morning must've cost her a</p>
<p class="null-p">lot of sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that… it's not that big of a reason, but…" "But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I joined the student council so that I could change myself and be more proactive with my thoughts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you told me about that before."</p>
<p class="null-p">When they were locked in the isolated storehouse, Ayano started telling Keiki about herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The trigger for that was when Shiho-senpai invited me. Before then, I didn't have any friends, and I just went along my day without caring about anything. I did like to study, but it felt like something was lacking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki somehow understood that feeling. This loneliness that didn't have a clear form, that almost felt like sadness. Probably because they both had nobody that they could entrust themselves to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But after I joined the student council, it was really interesting. The job was pretty difficult, but I was happy, and it felt like I was needed. And after a while, I started to enjoy going to school."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano forced out a smile while she reflected on her past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I want to help that girl so that she can have an enjoyable school life, just like I have now. If things work out with her boyfriend, I'm sure that'll happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the reason why she was working so hard. Though her goal felt simple, and way too self-sacrificing. Why was she forcing herself this much? And why was it that Keiki wanted to support her?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is this what they call charisma, I wonder?" "Charisma?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't mind me. What are we going to do now? If there's anything left that you want to see, then let's do it. I'll keep up with you until you're satisfied."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, now that we're here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wanted to help this hardworking girl. He didn't mind getting home a bit later if it was for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano, seeming a bit nervous, voiced her wish. "I'd like to… visit Kiryuu-kun's home." "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Keiki decided to grant her wish, and he brought Ayano to his home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So this is Kiryuu-kun's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't tall or tiny. It was just an average home that you could find anywhere. Even so, Ayano looked extraordinarily intrigued. Keiki put his hand on the door while giving her a sideways glance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah? It's locked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Mizuha wasn't home right now. Maybe she had gone out to shop, or had left for some other business. Since he had no other choice, he brought out his own key, unlocked the door, and let Ayano in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for intruding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… Just so you know, my parents aren't home all that often because of their jobs, so it's just me and my little sister. It seems like she's out right now, though, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just the two of us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't use this opportunity against me, okay?" "That's normally something a girl would say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just that Fujimoto-san seems to be the kind of person who's always on the attack… Anyway, my room is this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">After giving her the guest slippers to borrow, both of them went up the stairs to the second floor. After checking that he didn't have anything embarrassing lying around, he let the girl in his room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's unexpectedly clean. I thought that a boy's room would be rather messy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just because my little sister is a clean freak."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl would often go into her older brother's room to clean up anything that triggered her desire to clean.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And it really smells like Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah, that's the happiest face you've made all day…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she walked around the room, a bright smile filled her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, I'll go get something to drink… so don't go hunting for my underwear, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I don't have any interest in them once you've taken them off." "I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That statement didn't really help Keiki feel at ease.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I hope that nothing happens…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he felt anxious about leaving a pervert like her alone in his room, she was still a member of the student council, and a person that all the students looked up to.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wouldn't do anything too outrageous in another person's home, right? … Probably.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like, he wouldn't find her lying on his bed enjoying herself, or something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, a few minutes later, when Keiki came back with a tray with two teacups on it-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought so…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, Ayano was in the middle of enjoying herself on his bed. "…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when he thought that the worst-case scenario had occurred, he noticed that something about it was abnormal. The girl was indeed lying face-up on Keiki's bed, but her eyes were firmly closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's sleeping…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki now felt troubled by of a completely different reason than he had anticipated. Not to mention that her one-piece dress was pulled up, which made her underwear slightly visible…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Fujimoto-san is just… How careless can you be…?" He leaned over and was about to pull down her skirt- "-Got you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Woah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's eyes opened, as if she had been waiting for that moment, and she pulled Keiki's arm down with both of her hands. Now their position looked like Keiki had pushed down the girl on his bed. The shoulder straps of her dress fell down, revealing her pure white shoulders. Her bangs, which normally hid her other eye, were brushed away by the sudden movement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What's this about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried becoming a girl who plays around with a boy's heart." "Why?! And why were you just acting like you were sleeping?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Kiryuu-kun's a man, I thought that you would go on the attack if you caught a glimpse of my panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I couldn't even see them properly, and I was just trying to fix your skirt!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was desperately trying to stop any misunderstandings before they occurred, while Ayano was giving him a smile as she looked at him. This expression of hers was one that he didn't often see, and to be frank, it was really cute-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fujimoto-san, why do you always keep that one eye hidden?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I always had an introverted personality, I had problems with talking to people eye to eye. I got way too nervous all the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even now… I'm really nervous being this close to Kiryuu-kun." "Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyone would be nervous in this kind of position, not just introverted people. "Sorry, I'll get up right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano called out, stopping Keiki as he went to push himself up. "…Umm, thank you for today. For putting up with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't do anything special anyway, so don't worry about it." "That's not true."</p>
<p class="null-p">Calmy denying that statement, Ayano flashed a smile at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had a lot of fun going out with Kiryuu-kun. The date made me happy. After being with you all this time, I realized. I realized that this must be destiny…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even more so after coming here. When I heard Ootori-senpai's story, I thought that it sounded really wonderful. When I heard that it would be just the two of us, I… got my hopes up… that it'd be great if things turned out like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you… mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to that question, Ayano's cheeks flushed red- "Something like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting her arms around Keiki's back, she pulled him towards herself. Realizing what position they were in, the blood started rushing to Keiki's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"F-F-F-Fujimoto-san?!" "…I love it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love it. Kiryuu-kun's smell." "……Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love your smell so much that I want to take you home as a hugging pillow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I'm really just a pillow?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Again, he reached the pervert bad end. After what had happened yesterday with Mizuha, Keiki had his hopes up that Ayano might also hold romantic feelings for him, which was why she was so attracted to his smell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniff. Sniff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't just sniff me now?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ahh, so rich. Since we've been walking a lot, there's a lot of sweat." "You had planned for this from the very start?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl hadn't given up on the idea of turning Keiki into a hugging pillow that he had originally rejected that morning. She probably saw her chance when Koharu brought up the home date idea, and had used it as an excuse to get into Keiki's room, and to lure him into this trap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniff sniff… Ahhh, such a good smell… I can't get enough… Haaaaah…" "Nooooo?! Stop sniffing my neck?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Ayano was now completely entranced, and she was no longer listening to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Then, if I weren't sniffing your scent, could we still stay like this?" "Eh….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought for a moment that he had misheard, and he raised his head to look at Ayano. When he did, she became flustered and averted her gaze, all</p>
<p class="null-p">the while tightly gripping his back as she pushed him down.</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of reaction is that?! Do you want to kill me?! How cute can you beeeeeeeee!</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of this mysterious, yet cute, reaction, Keiki's face went even more red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway, let me go for now! If Mizuha sees us like this, then-" "Then what, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki turned his head around, Mizuha was standing in the doorway to his room, looking down at her older brother expressionlessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What would happen if I were to see you?" "Hyaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">To keep it short, nothing happened. Instead, for the rest of the day, he continued to continuously apologize to her while prostrating himself on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, after classes had ended, Ayano arrived at the student council office earlier than anyone else. The first thing she did was boot up the desktop PC, and after a short wait, the PC was ready to use. Shiho entered the room soon after.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-chan, good work today. You're fast today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to respond to that girl who sent the email, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, from the comment box. Did you come up with a good date plan?" "Yeah, I think I got the hang of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Now I'm kinda interested." "It's embarrassing, so no peeking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? That makes me even more interested, though." "No can do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, fine~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Giving a childish response, Shiho sat down on her usual seat. After making sure of that, Ayano began her work. She opened the email inbox and started typing. Slowly but steadily, she wrote down the answer that she had come up with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">She pushed the enter button, and the email was sent. It was sent to the girl who attended the same school as her. Without even knowing her name, she had sent the response she had worked so long and hard for. She didn't know if it was the right answer, and another student council member might have come up with a different answer. Even so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'd be nice if everything goes well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano wanted the girl to experience the same happiness that she had felt during her date with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 5:</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, inside the nurse's office, the responsible teacher, Tachibana Kaori (28 years old) was staring at the screen of her computer with a serious expression on her face. Having finished reading the contents of said screen, she grinned a bright smile and got up from her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes sense! Just being together would be more than enough! Thank you, everyone from the student council! All right, then it's serious date time starting next week!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The facility worker hyped herself up for the upcoming meeting with her first boyfriend ever. And with one final glance, she reread the contents of the email.</p>
<p class="null-p">'If you're together with the person you like, then the date is a success already.'</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Teasing Master Mitani- san</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was evening after Ayano's date had ended. Keiki was watching some variety TV when Mizuha, seeming to have just finished her bath, called out to him with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san! Nii-san! Let's watch a movie today!" "Ohh, nice idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Mizuha enjoyed watching movies on a regular basis, the siblings would often watch one or two if they had no school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what are we going to watch today?" "This."</p>
<p class="null-p">The movie that Mizuha handed him was a horror movie titled 'The Cursed Kindergarten.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? A horror movie?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It's a new movie that just came out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But aren't you bad with horror stuff? If you watch ghost stories on TV, you can't sleep alone, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, uh, wouldn't watching this result in the two of us sleeping together…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there a problem with that? Mister 'leaving his sister alone to push down a girl in his own room' Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will gladly watch this movie with you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The incident (misunderstanding) with Ayano had occurred around two hours ago. Although he had somehow managed to calm Mizuha down, her anger still didn't seem to have disappeared completely as of yet. And as a result, Keiki had no other option but to agree to Mizuha's 'request', and thus they started watching the movie. However, unlike the rather tame-sounding title, the contents of the movie were the exact opposite-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…N-Nii-san? If you fall asleep before me, I'll get angry, okay?" "That's why I told you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After spending about two hours in the completely dark living room, Mizuha was now unable to even go to the toilet alone, and upon completion of the movie she promptly dove into her older brother's bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really scared… I actually regret borrowing that movie." "Japanese horror movies can be pretty nasty, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike western movies that rely on jumpscares and shocking moments, the constant uncomfortable feeling that pushes itself upon you throughout the whole movie is what makes Japanese horror so different.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I feel an even greater fear right now than what some B horror movie could ever hope to deliver…</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation right now, with his little sister, in her pyjamas, sleeping next to him in the same bed, was even more terrifying. Although the same incident was induced by alcohol last time, Keiki had been assaulted by his little sister while he was sleeping before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-saaaaan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whoa, I beg of you, please don't cling to me like that! My reason will crumble!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about I strip?" "Why do you even ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Quite some time ago, he had found out that the two of them weren't related by blood. Since he now knew that, and since Mizuha now constantly approached him, he can't help but start to see her not as a little sister, but as a girl. Needless to say, being clung to was too much for him to handle, much less seeing her strip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I like the Nii-san that still lets me sleep with him." "I don't really like a little sister who's so self-centered." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, that was a lie. It actually makes me happy." "Fufu, Nii-san is quite the siscon, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think I could win against a brocon like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Normal siblings probably wouldn't sleep together at an age like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">And right now, with their backs facing each other, a short moment of silence passed before Keiki spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About before; that thing with Fujimoto-san was just a misunderstanding, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you're not mad anymore?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not mad anymore. I'm really not, but… I might be a bit worried." "Worried?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, Nii-san gets friendly with other girls all the time, and all the girls from the student council are really cute… As a girl who loves Nii-san, I just get worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, the club has also been on ice… And Nii-san is coming home… later and… later…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's voice grew more faint. "I'm a bit… lonely…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And with those final words, Mizuha entered the world of dreams. "Lonely, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a matter of fact, Keiki had been so busy with student council work that he was coming home pretty late these days. Since there weren't any club activities, either, Mizuha was alone, always waiting for Keiki to return.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Mizuha, for not realizing it sooner…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Making sure that she wouldn't wake up, he started patting her head. Since their parents were rarely home for such long periods of time, he left his little sister all alone at home, even though he should've known that she always longed for his presence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…From tomorrow onwards, I'll come home as soon as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a salaryman who would try his best to come home as quickly as possible to his waiting wife, Keiki made up his decision to do the same as he closed his eyes. And thus, the long, busy holiday came to an end-</p>
<p class="null-p">The night had ended, and the rising sun came forth to herald a new day. When Keiki opened his eyes after this rough night of sleep, his vision was obstructed by something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he lifted his body upright, the object that had previously robbed him of his sight came fluttering down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl's pure white panties. Mizuha had apparently stripped off her clothes in her sleep. And not just the panties. On top of the bed, Keiki could spot the upper part of the pyjamas, the lower part, as well as an unexpectedly large bra.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, this means…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning his gaze to his side, he saw his completely naked little, seemingly enjoying her dreams, with her face was distorted into a big smile. Seeing this scene, Keiki let out a shriek that could normally only be heard from a young maiden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, I have to do something about Mizuha's exibitionistic traits soon…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If she were to go fully naked all the time like that, all the reason and logical thinking that Keiki had wouldn't be enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reminiscing about this morning's incident, Keiki was walking through the school building. He finally arrived at his destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work today~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since classes had ended, every member of the student council was already present in the student council office, doing their own respective work, and they greeted Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, good work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, yeah… You too, Fujimoto-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's seat was next to Ayano's. Though he barely managed to force out a greeting and sat down on his chair, he couldn't help but remember what had happened yesterday when he looked at her face. Whatever the reason behind it was, he had still been hugged by her while the two of them were lying down on his bed. Not to mention that Ayano's final words "If I wasn't sniffing you, could we still stay like this?" were stuck in the back of his mind, making it impossible for him not to be conscious of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…… Peek"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like that was the same for Ayano, because she also threw some sideways glances at him from time to time. In the end, both of them just sat there, in this awkward atmosphere, until…</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That reminds me, what about the advice that you were supposed to give?" "A-Ah, I just got a response."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see…" "Yeah…" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the awkward silence continued. Even a newborn couple would probably be able to hold a more fluent conversation. Meanwhile, Rin was watching the two of them with a sparkle in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keikun-senpai, Ayanon-senpai, did something happen?" "No, not really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really." "Really? …Weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course something had actually happened, but both of them knew that they couldn't talk about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than that, Mitani-san, I think that your position right now is bad in a lot of ways."</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, the girl was hugging her knees while sitting on her chair. Of course, the position in and of itself wasn't the problem, but rather the fact that her panties were very close to being visible from where Keiki was sitting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, are you interested? I see, I see. Keikun-senpai is a boy after all~ I really let my guard down there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm not interested or anything!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A blatant lie. Every boy would be interested, of course.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Senpai's getting a bit excited there, I'll sit normally now, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pay some more attention, okay? You keep your guard way too low, Mitani- san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she didn't have any significant size in terms of breasts, she had the girly gestures, enough to make your heart race if used efficiently. How devilish she could be.</p>
<p class="null-p">And while Keiki was trying his hardest not to turn red from embarrassment, Airi, sitting across from him, threw him a cold gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you getting flustered because of someone like Mitani-san?" "I'm very sorry! I'll do my job seriously now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I don't really mind. You can be as lovey-dovey as you want…" "Eh? Nagase-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had just received the permission to be lovey-dovey with another girl from the moral elitist Airi. Normally, she'd fall into a rage if Ayano were to</p>
<p class="null-p">simply cling to his arm. "…Haaah."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then there's also this exasperated sigh. Not to mention that she looked like she wasn't getting anywhere with her work, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uhm, Shiho-senpai. Can I go get some fresh air outside?" "I don't mind, but… Are you okay, Airi-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said, clearly not looking fine at all, as she left the room. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he knew he was just meddling at this point, Keiki couldn't put this out of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai! I'm going out as well!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaaay, take your time~"</p>
<p class="null-p">He got up from his seat and was seen off by a grinning Shiho. Though he felt a bit embarrassed that he had seen that, he nonetheless left the student council office behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">After searching around for her characteristic beige-colored twintails, Keiki finally spotted Airi sitting on a bench in the courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kiryuu-senpai? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I'm supposed to say. Seeing you sigh like that just made me wonder if something had happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It doesn't have anything to do with Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Airi wasn't the type of person to be honest, Keiki had expected that reaction. He would have to work a bit harder than that to get a real answer out of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Nagase-san offered me her advice before, now it's my turn to help you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Really. Kiryuu-senpai is too kind for his own good," Airi said, a faint smile forming on her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was the kind of person who needed a reason for everything, or else she wouldn't be satisfied. When Keiki sat down next to the girl on the bench, she started explaining.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really didn't want to do this… A few days ago, I invited Koga-san to watch a movie, but she immediately rejected me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She also rejected my invitation to eat lunch together as well, and she doesn't look that enthusiastic about talking with me, either, so I just felt a bit… sad…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that's why you were sighing like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thought about it, he had witnessed Yuika immediately shutting down Airi's request to become friends. Even so, she apparently continued to approach her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san, why do you want to be so friendly with Yuika-chan?" "It's because Koga-san is so incredibly cute!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her skin is so white that it's almost scary, her blonde hair is beautiful, and I can't stop thinking that she's a doll. I can barely keep myself from hugging</p>
<p class="null-p">her! …She's completely opposite from Kiryuu-senpai." "Well, comparing me to Yuika-chan is a bit over the top."</p>
<p class="null-p">If you compared a super beauty like her to a boring boy like him, anyone would prefer to look at the beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My goal is to become friends with her, and pinch her cute little cheeks!" "…Nagase-san, are you sure you're not into that sort of thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki grew worried after hearing the girl's words. "But Koga-san doesn't allow me any openings." "Yuika-chan is like a hedgehog, isn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Becoming friends with the introverted, shy Yuika certainly isn't an easy feat. Not to mention that the only places where she would show her honest smile were in her own home or the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, Kiryuu-senpai? Can you help me get closer to Koga-san?" "Hmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he really wanted to help his Kouhai with her request, when he remembered how Airi had talked about Yuika, as well as the yuri novel where she used her and Sayuki as models, it made Keiki anxious about agreeing. Would it really be okay to let such a dangerous individual get close to his precious kouhai Yuika?</p>
<p class="null-p">…Wait a second? If Yuika-chan were able to get more friends, couldn't that possibly help cure her sadistic nature…?</p>
<p class="null-p">The chance existed that her cold, sadistic heart would feel warmth again, and she would stop wanting to make Keiki her slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">As of right now, Keiki's 'De-perversion plan' had made no progress whatsoever. He wanted to try out everything he could. And he genuinely</p>
<p class="null-p">wanted to help Yuika get more friends, as well. "All right! I'll help you, Nagase-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus it was decided that Keiki would help Airi with her one-sided feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">As an aside, that day happened to be Keiki's birthday, so Mizuha had baked him a delicious cake as a present.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, after classes had ended, Keiki, who had received permission to take the day off from Shiho, had finished preparing the battlefield to deepen Airi's and Yuika's bond, and now went out to call his target. Thinking that the girl was probably sitting in the library while reading a book, he sent her a quick mail, saying 'Want to go drink some tea at a nearby cafe?', and received a 'Yes of course!' in a response a few minutes later. Keiki and Airi waited, and the blonde-haired angel finally arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she spotted her Senpai sitting at a window, she called out to him. "Keiki-sen-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she spotted Airi sitting on the other side of the table, her gleeful expression disappeared immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why is Nagase-san here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, I just happened to meet her here. So I thought that I might as well invite her along."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A coincidence, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's eyes wandered over to look straight at her male Senpai. Her eyes were saying 'You planned this, didn't you?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Just when Yuika thought she could be alone with Keiki-senpai." "U-Umm… If I'm just a bother, then I'll leave…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need. It'd just feel like Yuika forced you away."</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a sigh, Yuika also sat down. Of course, next to Keiki. Still, the fact that she didn't run away immediately showed that she at least didn't hate Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh. Yuika suddenly feels like eating the special parfait here." "Please let me treat you, my fair lady."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after, they called over an employee, and gave them their order. "Thank you for waiting~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The order came back at a speed you would only expect from cup ramen. A beautiful-looking fruit parfait. After putting one spoon of it into her mouth, Yuika's face turned into a bright smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… it's so delicious… it feels like Yuika's tongue will melt."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just by looking at her, your chest would feel all fuzzy. And Airi seemed to agree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, the parfait-eating Koga-san is so cute… The real thing in front of you really is better than just pictures… I want to take her home and pat her head forever…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Dangerous wishes leaked from the perverted yuri author's mouth. Her breathing grew rough, and rather than a beauty, she looked more like a middle-aged old man who would be better off arrested. Keiki still didn't know if it was safe to help Airi out like this, but he deemed that it was still necessary for his own ends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, what exactly do you think of Nagase-san?" Keiki asked. "Kiryuu-senpai?! Isn't that a bit too straightforward?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi became flustered by Keiki's abrupt question, and they both looked at Yuika, waiting for her response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't hate Nagase-san." "Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But she doesn't really like her, either." "Ehhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told that you aren't hated gets your hopes up, only to be crushed by the sudden denial of affection shortly after. A feeling all too well-known.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But suddenly asking Yuika to become friends is a bit troublesome. She doesn't know anything about Nagase-san, after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koga Yuika was an easily-frightened girl. Since she was unable to become friends with people, she saw books as her true friends. Every since she had started attending this school, she would always hole up in the library and read books. When you consider that, it makes sense that she wouldn't just blindly trust everybody.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about you try talking with her more, so that you learn about her? You can always decide later if you want to become friends with her, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why does it feel like Keiki-senpai is just trying to push this in his own direction for his own benefit?" said Yuika, pouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, she mustered up her courage and turned towards Airi. "Umm, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just as Yuika told you, suddenly being approached like this is rather uncomfortable for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Yuika was still happy that you talked to her… And her reaction was just because of surprise, or something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason Yuika declined your invitation was because she wasn't prepared for it… And, as she said, Yuika doesn't really know anything about Nagase- san either… It's not like she hated the idea of being invited."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehmmm? So, does that mean…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Airi tilted her head in confusion, Keiki continued the flow of conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, Yuika-chan just can't be honest with herself, and she actually wants to be friends with Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika didn't say that, though?!" Yuika said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, Yuika-chan really is such a dishonest child. You actually want a friend like Nagase-san, right? Come on, just honestly say 'Let's be friends?' to her, and everything's A-Okay~ If you can't, then I can take that part for you and-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing as how her upperclassman had gotten ahead of himself, Yuika gave a slight giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't stop talking immediately, you'll get Yuika's panties stuffed into your mouth again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With the still-recent trauma rushing to his brain, Keiki's body started shivering. But this certainly wasn't the time for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Koga-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not knowing Yuika's real personality, the third person could only stare at her in disbelief. The blonde-haired beauty's words probably were too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Koga-san said she'd stuff her panties into his mouth. Koga-san said she'd stuff her panties into his mouth. Koga-san said she'd stuff her panties into his mouth…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like reciting a mantra over and over, Airi was muttering to herself, expressionless. That was just how much of a shock that must have been to. Since Keiki had himself received a great deal of trauma from Yuika's sadistic nature, he could completely understand her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me… is Koga-san a sadist?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about it? Do you mean to say that we can't be friends because of that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Woah, Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that makes it even better! A sadistic Koga-san… That's totally alright with me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's actually perfect!" "Ehhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase-san seemed to even welcome Yuika's sadistic side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm really surprised, but this is a rather welcome miscalculation. Just imagining a little devil Koga-san teasing Sayuki-sepai… It seems like I'll make good progress this evening!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Progress?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, don't pay any attention to her."</p>
<p class="null-p">If she knew that Airi was playing with her mentally, she definitely wouldn't</p>
<p class="null-p">be able to be friends with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since it's already out, Yuika might as well tell you right here. She actually plans on making Keiki-senpai her slave, so Yuika would very much appreciate it if you weren't trying to go against her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai… your slave?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you mean to tell Yuika to stop since this goes against your morals?" Yuika asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, please tell her that," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Yuika might finally stop her plans. That was what the slave candidate was hoping for, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's pretty nice, I think!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki received an imaginary hit to his gut from these words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being slaves is enough for men! Being a slave to such a cute girl like Koga- san is a reward, I say! I'll support you wholeheartedly, Koga-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The blonde-haired queen was looking at Airi with deeply moved eyes. That dry atmosphere from before seemed like a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? What is this development?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki had planned on the two of them to get closer, but this certainly wasn't what he had been hoping for. Rather than finding a way to rehabilitate Yuika, he had given her a supporter for her 'Make Keiki-senpai Yuika's slave' plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I… mess up really badly here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Our poor protagonist completely made everything worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">The last lunch break of the week: Friday. Keiki was called over to the clubroom by Sayuki, and he was greeted by a zombie-like girl resting herself on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, welcome, Master…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not your master… No, never mind that. What's wrong? You look really sleepy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am actually very sleepy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you working on your next contest entry all night again?" "No. I'm tired from this job that I'm still not used to."</p>
<p class="null-p">Recently, the girl would immediately go over to her part-time job as a waitress in a family restaurant after her classes ended. Not to mention that she apparently often took weekend shifts, so the sleep she was getting at home didn't seem to be sufficient.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Earning money really is a lot of trouble…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you now understand how evil it is to misuse the precious club budget?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I have very much reflected on it." That seemed to be the truth this time around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do reflect on it, but my work really is tough, you know? I thought that I could give it my best so that I can get a reward from Keiki-kun, but my lust for getting spanked can only carry me so far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I get it. I understand the reason why you called me here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good. To be precise, it's so that Keiki-kun will spoil me to my heart's content!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that cold response was half a reward by itself!" "Really, I wish I was half as optimistic as a masochist."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, she had close to about a month left of work until she could be free again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you seem to be working earnestly. A bit should be fine." "Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to massage my shoulders." "Your shoulders?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My shoulders hurt from carrying all the orders. My shoulders were hurting before anyway because my breasts are so big."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better not say that while Yuika-chan's around."</p>
<p class="null-p">It would definitely spark a war. Big breasts are the enemy of every flat- chested girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I just have to massage your shoulders, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, and you can even move your hands down and fondle my breasts, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll start then~" "I was ignored?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not biting at Sayuki's joke, Keiki rubbed his hands over the girl's shoulders as she sat upright in the chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Woah… Sayuki-senpai's shoulders are so slim… Of course her shoulders would start to hurt if she had to carry those melons of hers…</p>
<p class="null-p">Having gained new knowledge about a girl's body, he started massaging her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… Ahh, that feels good… Very… good… Yes…" "I-Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, right the-re?! More! Be more rough!" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she was only saying that Keiki's message felt good, but it still felt very immoral because of her erotic sounding groans.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm, Sayuki-senpai? Can you please keep your voice down a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're just massaging my shoulders, so what exactly might you be fantasizing about? You're such a perv, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reasoning isn't fair?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on. If you don't hurry up, lunch break will end soon." "I know… But, please try to hold back your voice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't help it then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki regained his composure and resumed his massage. "…Nnnn… Fuuu… Nnn?! Nnnn~~~?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was indeed holding back her voice. But, trying her hardest to hold back said groans had the exact opposite effect, and she was giving off a rather lecherous feeling again. The groans, her current appearance… everything about her was just pure eros. For a virgin like Keiki, the whole situation was incredibly stimulating. And while he was trying his best to keep his fantasies in check, Sayuki called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Keiki-kun?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll work even harder. Once I pay back the debt, let's all have fun together, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Sayuki spoke those words, all the different memories he had gathered all this time came flying back to mind. Seeing that Sayuki was reassuring them just as much made Keiki feel happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. And for that, you have to keep working hard." "Yes, I'll do that and pay it back with my body!" "Phrasing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I were to flash my breasts a bit, I'm sure I could earn some more tips." "You're nothing more than a waitress, so please don't do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Otherwise she would get fired for real this time, and their club would get disbanded.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, after classes had ended, Shiho spoke up when she returned to the student council office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, I know that tomorrow is Saturday, but could I get you to come to school nonetheless?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you planning?" "Pool cleaning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pool cleaning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We used it up until the end of September, but we really can't use it how it is now. That's why I'd like to clean it in preparation for next year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the student council even does work like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah. Normally, the people from the swimming club would do it, but since they managed to score a training match with another strong club, they couldn't let their chance go to waste."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's why it's up to the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho probably had been asked to do the cleaning from the swimming club advisor when she stopped by the teacher's office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though we'll have to do it on a holiday, this'll cause the swimming club to owe us a favour, so we can push another annoying job on them. Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Takisaki-senpai, you have some rather wicked traits about you." "Yeah. She's the type to stay down when she falls over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's Shiichan-senpai's charm, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I didn't hear Mitani-san's opinion right now, I have to agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki, Ayano, Rin and Airi all gave their opinions about her scheming, but Shiho completely ignored them and kept talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since nobody seems to have any other plans, we'll go ahead then. Everyone, bring clothes tomorrow that you don't mind getting dirty in!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeeeees!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Keiki's plans for the upcoming Saturday had been decided. Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning of said Saturday, Keiki made his way to school at the same time as every school day, changed in the chloroform-filled changing room into his t-shirt and shorts, and made his way to the pool.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, now this looks like it'll be worthwhile to clean!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The water had already been drained from the pool, and you could clearly see the rather dirty bottom. Of course, the weather was perfect for pool-cleaning. Though it was the middle of October, the temperature had been soothing, but not too cold, making it neither too cold nor too hot with their shorts on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-kun, thanks for waiting~" "Thanks for waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for waiting…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls who appeared at the poolside were Shiho, Ayano and Airi. Every one of them was wearing a school swimsuit, along with a short-sleeved t-shirt and shorts, revealing their dazzling thighs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The three of you look really good." "Ehehe, thank you~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say that, I'll get flustered…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Your gaze is as indecent as always. This is why men are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">One was happy, the other embarrassed, and the last one's gaze went cold in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, finally-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for being late~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking like she was a kid left alone by her parents in the supermarket, Rin came running towards the group. Unlike the other three, she was not wearing a school swimsuit, but rather a jersey top with shorts, which was also quite the feast for the eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you acting like you're some important manager who has the right to arrive late, Mitani?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that interesting. I let my guard down a bit and immediately fell asleep again."</p>
<p class="null-p">And even so, she managed to arrive on time, acting like she was late. "Mitani-san isn't wearing a swimsuit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha, a school swimsuit is a bit embarrassing, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Playing with her short hair in a flustered way, the smiling Kouhai looked pretty cute. Just that alone made it worth it for Keiki to have come here on a holiday.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, since all the members are here, let's start cleaning!" "Aye!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following the student council president's orders, their work officially started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First, I'd like to split up roles. Since we only have four deck brushes, one of us has to do the cleaning with the hose."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! I'll do it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who immediately raised her hand was Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I left the hose to Keiki-senpai, he'd probably spray water all over us." "Do you really have that kind of image of me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the role of the hose user was decided, the other four picked up their</p>
<p class="null-p">respective deck brushes. Rin would be responsible for the poolside, while Shiho, Ayano, and Keiki's job was the bottom of the pool.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, the water is splashing here and there. Good thing we put on swimsuits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This slippery feeling on my soles… not bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of sensitivity do you have, Fujimoto-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ones responsible for the bottom of the pool worked with their cleaning tools, slowly but steadily making progress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, if the pool is empty right now, where does the swimming club practice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They use the indoor pool close by."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, because then they can practice even if it's cold outside."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their brushes moved along the floor, while Airi was letting in some water as well with the hose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aha, this is actually pretty fun." "Ah, be careful not to slip okay?" "Eh? …A-Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after she was warned, Airi slipped on the wet floor, and landed perfectly on her butt. Meanwhile, the hose was still running, and she ended up completely drenching her shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, cold…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I told you to be careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't help me if you tell me right before!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like her fall hurt quite a bit, because tears started building up in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about that. Here…" "Ah… thank you very much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki reached out his hand, the girl immediately took it. That was something you would have never imagined after their first meeting. Keiki worked hard to get closer to her, only for it to be ruined by the bunny girl incident, resetting them back to zero. Still, it was clear that he was slowly making progress again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll get bruises on your butt otherwise." "I know! I'm not a kid!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sticking out her tongue in a cute fashion, Airi walked away with the hose in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san seems to be in high spirits today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, her tsundere attribute would be shining through at every possibility, but the sprinkling of the water seemed to be too entrancing for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a short break, Keiki stopped working and looked at the scenery around him. Shiho and Airi were working on a patch of dirt on the pool wall, while Ayano was silently brushing away at the pool floor. When his eyes met with Rin's, who was still working at the poolside, she gave him a slight wave and a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, things like these really are fun." He remembered a similar scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone was working on one thing as a group, and while spending time</p>
<p class="null-p">together with everyone else, even the most annoying work turned fun. It was just like-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu-kun, is everything okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he came back to his senses, Ayano was standing in front of his eyes. She probably grew worried because Keiki had abruptly stopped working.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just reminiscing a bit. This totally feels like our big cleaning operation back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cleaning operation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai messed up the clubroom, and we got scolded by our advisor. I was called over by her to help out, and in the end, even Yuika-chan, Nanjou, and Mizuha joined in… It was a lot of work, but it was also really fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">That day back in May, all of the current club members gathered and helped clean the room. After that, Keiki spotted the love letter that was missing the girl's name, as well as the panties. They were unforgettable memories, in a lot of ways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you felt similar to how you felt back then?" "Yeah, I think so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was now enveloped in the same feeling he had back then. "Then there's one thing I'd like you to think about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Kiryuu-kun is not against it, I'd like you to stay in the student council even after your debt is repaid. Not just as a temporary member, but a full- fledged one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once everything about the club budget was cleared up, Keiki would naturally</p>
<p class="null-p">return to the calligraphy club. That was the condition Shiho had established, and that was what Keiki had been assuming. But Ayano wanted Keiki to stay. That meant that Keiki had the choice to remain in the student council if he wished to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the very least, I always wanted Kiryuu-kun to join the student council. And everyone must feel the same. Even Airi, I'm sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy to hear that, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that the student council needed male members was a harsh reality. But this wasn't something he could decide upon right then, right there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you two over there! No having fun right now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, a warning from Airi arrived at their ears. "If you don't hurry, we won't get out of here until late!" "A-Ahh, yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, we have to focus on the cleaning right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Deciding that they would resume this topic later, the two of them continued their individual work. And, although he was working earnestly, these words of Ayano's wouldn't leave Keiki's mind the whole time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just after noon had passed, the cleaning was done.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright. Since I took care of the cleaning equipment, it's time for me to change as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">After having magnificently lost a rock paper scissors match, Keiki was entrusted with putting away the deck brushes and the hose. Now that that was done, he made his way to the changing room. Though he wasn't quite as wet as Airi, who had gotten drenched before, he still was a bit wet from all water and sweat. To make sure that he wouldn't catch a cold as a result, he decided to immediately change and-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's Keikun-senpai." "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A naked Rin greeted him from inside the supposedly empty room. Luckily, the girl had her back turned to him, preventing her most precious places from being seen by Keiki, but that meant that Keiki still caught a glimpse of her slim shoulders, her beautiful body line, and even her cute, little butt-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so very sorryyyyyy!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Peeping Tom couldn't with stand that sight anymore, and dashed out of the changing room as fast as he could. He then chose the actual men's changing room that was next to the previous one he had entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaah… To think I'd go into the wrong changing room…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe he was tired after his cleaning work. Barging into the girl's changing room like that would surely haunt him later.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll have to bow down to the ground and apologize to Mitani-san later…</p>
<p class="null-p">However, now he was certain that he had found the men's changing room, and let out a relieved sigh-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun…?" "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Interrupting Keiki's thoughts was a girl's voice. When Keiki raised his head in terror to search for the source, he was greeted by Ayano, who was wearing nothing but her underwear-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no other choice but to let out a frustrated groan. After all, nothing made any sense anymore. If Rin was using the other changing room, then a girl being here should never happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Fujimoto-san here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why wouldn't I be…? This is the girl's changing room." "What?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Keiki finally understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one that was using the wrong room wasn't me, but Mitani-san!</p>
<p class="null-p">When he realized that, everything made sense. Alas, this realization wouldn't change his current situation in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… If you stare at me like that, I'll get embarrassed…" "Uwa?! S-Sorry?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After receiving the obvious complaint, Keiki hurriedly turned around to face the doorway. Her appearance was so entrancing that he couldn't take his eyes away at first. Whether it be her slim, white shoulders, the form of her beasts that Ayano had so much confidence in, or her dazzling legs, everything was burned into Keki's eyes. Keiki cursed himself for thinking that he was lucky to have seen that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, if you don't leave soon, Airi and the others will come back-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just after she barely managed to finish her warning, Keiki heard girls' voices coming from the back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, this is bad…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed as if Airi and Shiho went in to take a shower, and were now on their way back. It'd be bad enough if he was spotted here as it was, but the underwear-clad Ayano in front of him would seriously made things worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-W-W-W-What should I do?!" "Kiryuu-kun, over here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! Fujimoto-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this worst-case scenario, he was saved by the, literally, saving hand from Ayano. Seeing as there was no other choice, she pulled Keiki into a locker, and for some reason, she came along. Immediately after they closed the door, Airi and Shiho came back, their bodies only hidden by a bath towel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? Ayano-senpai isn't here. Did she already finish changing?" "It seems like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I'm a bit tired today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. My muscles will probably hurt all day tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">While the two of them started changing while continuing their chitchat, Keiki and Ayano held their breath inside the locker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keep it quiet, okay?" "Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And no looking at them while they change." "I know, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew that using this chance to peek at the girls would make him the</p>
<p class="null-p">lowest of the lowest.</p>
<p class="null-p">But… I can't exactly focus on Fujimoto-san either…</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the narrow locker, they ended up in a position where they were facing each other at all times. Just recently, Keiki had enjoyed his time being trapped in a locker with Airi, but the circumstances were quite different now. After all, as mentioned already, Ayano was only wearing her underwear, making her half-nude. If they were to get any closer, even if Keiki tried his best to attain zen like Buddha, his son would jump to action at some point.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ugh… I really didn't want to use this, but… There's no helping it!</p>
<p class="null-p">If Keiki got hard now, his life would without a doubt be over, so he tried calming down his waking-up son with imagining his parents' faces to somehow get him to fall asleep again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, why did you even come in here with me, Fujimoto-san?!" "Ah, I didn't think that far ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-saaaaaaan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In stressful situations, humans often make very irrational decisions. It probably never occurred to Ayano that she only had to hide Keiki, not herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… Now that it's come to this…" "Yeah, there's no choice but to wait here." "It figures…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, the locker conversation came to an abrupt end. Still, that didn't mean that Keiki's suffering stopped. The girl's breasts were still pressing against him, and he was very close to reaching his limit…</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this awkward situation?!</p>
<p class="null-p">If he were to look down, the girl's plump breasts, only protected by her grey underwear, would enter his view, and even if he were able to force his gaze away, the locker was still filled with the girl's sweet scent. And that seemed to be the same for his own odour, seeing as-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaaah… Haaaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki realized in that moment that Ayano had started to look weird. Her breathing grew rough, her eyes watery, and her beautiful cheeks were turning more and more red. Keiki immediately knew that her 'switch' had been flipped.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu… kun…" "F-Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I… I'm really getting excited by your smell right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">What almost sounded like a confession was followed by Ayano resting her head on Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Fujimoto-san?! This isn't the time or the place for that!" "Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun doesn't get excited by a girl's scent?" "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be a lie if he said no. Especially since right now Ayano's scent was stimulating his brain cells.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might be a bit more sensitive for some people, but wanting to smell the odor of the opposite sex isn't as weird as you might think it is, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. That's why-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Puffing out her chest in confidence, the girl said the following. "Do you want to… try out my scent as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to this invitation, which started grinding away at Keiki's reason, he unintentionally gulped. Her slightly sweaty, but still pure-white skin was right in front of him. If he were to give in and lower his head, her breasts would probably take him to heaven-</p>
<p class="null-p">That was exactly why, even though he knew he shouldn't give in, he couldn't</p>
<p class="null-p">deny her. "Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing her soft, seductive voice, Keiki could only give in- "What… Are you two doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or maybe that was what would have happened, if they weren't spotted by Airi, who had finished changing into her uniform. That should have come as no surprise, seeing as how they had started talking in a normal tone of voice somewhere in there.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they explained the situation, Airi once more had an exasperated look on her face. But it seemed like she decided to trust Keiki in the end, which showed that their friendship level was slowly rising. When Keiki finished changing, he stepped out of the male's changing room, only to be greeted by the waiting Rin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani-san? Where are the others?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They all went to the toilet together. They said that we'd go to a restaurant after this to celebrate a job well done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That aside, though, I heard it from Shiichan-senpai. How lucky for to see Ayanon-senpai in her underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san got really angry with me as a result, though." "Ahhh, yeah. Nagase-san isn't good with that sort of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, no matter the reason, there were no excuses for ending up in that sort of situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also need to apologize to you, Mitani-san. Though it was an accident, I did see you naked after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry~ I'm not embarrassed to be seen by a boy." "That's totally something you should worry about."</p>
<p class="null-p">The way the girl thought made Keiki worry for her sake as well. Since she was on Airi's level of cuteness, she should definitely maintain at least a bare minimum of caution.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, what a horrible day this was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've been busy explaining the situation to Nagase-san, after all. Good work on that~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, I went through hell back then because you went into the wrong room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh? I didn't go into the wrong room." "……Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's surprise was fairly obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no no, you clearly were in the wrong room. You were changing in the boys' changing room, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that was on purpose." "???"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, it felt like the two of them were talking past each other. "Ahhh, I see. Senpai doesn't know after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't know what… Wait, Mitani-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki, now completely lost as to what was happening, had his hand grabbed by Rin, and she guided it towards her lower half.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was about to touch a girl's most important place, although still protected by her skirt and panties. But when his hand finally felt something-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm? Hmmmmm?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's expression distorted into one of shock-</p>
<p class="null-p">"The boys' changing room is where I belong. After all, both my mind and body are that of a man."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a bright smile on his face, the boy spoke this cruel reality. A confession that Keiki didn't want to believe. But what Keiki felt right now through the skirt was definite proof. The moment Keiki realized what exactly that was, a scream filled with despair rang through the school building, as this already horrendous holiday became even worse.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: This passing world is full of perverts</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">After the pool cleaning operation ended, Keiki and the members of the student council all changed into their uniforms, and they were now on their way to a nearby hamburger restaurant for an afterparty. The seat distribution was the same as when they had eaten at the family restaurant earlier, with several set menus on top of the table. Keiki's gaze, however, wasn't directed at the delicious looking lunch, but rather at the pervert sitting across the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I didn't expect that Mitani was a crossdressing pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Calling me a pervert is taking it too far, though! If you were as cute as me, it'd be a waste to not wear any girl clothes! That'd be just a waste!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"On top of your crossdressing hobby, you're also quite the narcissist, I see!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mitani Rin was actually a boy who wears girls' clothing. Not a girl but a boy. Not Rin-chan, but Rin-kun. After finding out about that, Keiki had started calling him Mitani instead of Mitani-san, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that a beauty like you, who looks so good in a skirt, is actually a boy… I still can't believe it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then would you like to check one more time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'll pass on that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without a doubt, the proof that Rin was a man was dangling between his</p>
<p class="null-p">legs. Being forced to feel that again would be nothing short of punishment for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That explains why you were the only one not wearing a school swimsuit." "It'd be a bit tight, after all. Though I won't say where."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's as plain as day what you're talking about, anyway… And this also explains Nagase-san's cold gaze towards you."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he glanced at Airi, who was about to stuff french fries into her mouth, she complained.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. I have no intentions of being kind to a boy, even if he looks like a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you knew already, why didn't you just tell me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because it was fun watching you. I was getting excited waiting for you to finally realize it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, are you disappointed now that you've found out your cute Kouhai is actually a boy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much Keiki wanted to be angry at her, that smile of hers was too cute, and he couldn't muster up the strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai and Fujimoto-san, too. Why didn't you just tell me?" "Keeping quiet was way more fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You people…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">These were the kind of sickos who would enjoy deceiving other people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Fujimoto-san, didn't you tell me that 'The secretary is also a girl' back then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before the final exams for the first term, he could faintly recall having a conversation like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back then, the secretary was a third-year girl. She had to stop her student council work because of entrance exams, so we scouted Mitani-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, Rin and Airi were both first-years. They couldn't have been members for that long.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I was the one who invited Rin-chan over to the student council. I was really surprised when he told me about his condition for him to join, namely that he wanted to wear the girls uniform."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that kind of deal went down…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Rin had started wearing the girls uniform after getting permission from Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? But Mitani, does that mean that you don't always wear the female uniform?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I do wear my normal male uniform when I'm in class. I just change into it when classes end. When I wear the female uniform during work, my efficiency goes up, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did you even get your hands on a girl's uniform?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A cousin of mine graduated from this school, and I got it as a hand-me- down."</p>
<p class="null-p">And that cousin didn't think twice about handing that uniform over to a boy? "Do the others not have any reservations about Mitani wearing a skirt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're used to it at this point, and it'd only feel weird if he wore something else now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At times, I even forget that he's a boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I can accept him like this more than if he were wearing a boys uniform."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho, Ayano, and even Airi gave their opinions on the present matter. Apparently, they didn't see any problems with him wearing the girl's uniform. But there was one thing that still made Keiki feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani… I have a question for you, and I would like you to honestly answer me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani-you don't actually like boys, do you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry to disappoint, but rather than a boy's chest, I'd always welcome a good pair of girls breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Safeeeee!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Rin was a crossdresser, his target gender was still the same as Keiki's. Still, considering that he was a boy who looked like a beauty, Keiki was glad that this didn't turn into a development that a certain fujoshi would enjoy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, this all sounds like a pain, so I'll just call you 'Rinko' when you're wearing girls clothes, and 'Rintarou' when it's the male you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that actually makes us sound pretty close! I like it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not the slightest bit happy about that… And why did I get excited all these times even though you were a boy…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart skipping a beat after seeing a boy's belly, getting his hopes up after almost seeing a boy's panties, getting bright red when seeing a boy in the</p>
<p class="null-p">changing room… "Uwaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he didn't know about it back then, the very fact that he had become excited because of a boy made him want to die. And while Keiki slowly collapsed into despair, Shiho raised her voice, seeming to have remembered something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, right, student council work will be on short break after next week starts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. After Wednesday, midterms are going to start, after all." "Midterms… you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Judging from that reaction, you probably forgot about them?" "N-No way, t-t-t-that's totally not what's happening here." "Your voice is totally shaking, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had been so busy with student council work, he had completely forgotten about them. Of course, this meant that he hadn't once studied for the tests.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're worried about it, then how about you have Ayano-chan help out with your studies?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have Fujimoto-san help me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked over to the girl sitting next to him, he found her putting one hand on her chest as she returned his gaze with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're fine with me, then I'll help you." "Please do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Vice president Fujimoto Ayano was known as an honour student. With that in mind, she would surely be of great help.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">The Monday of the following week, Keiki and Ayano were together in the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's start our studies now." "I'll be in your care."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Make sure to call me Ayano-sensei during our studies." "Yes, Ayano-sensei!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting next to the honour-student-turned-honour-teacher, Keiki enthusiastically opened up his math workbook and progressed with his studies according to Ayano-sensei's advice. With a distance between them close enough for their shoulders to touch at any second, Ayano's cheeks softened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It almost feels like we're lovers when we're like this." "Mmm? Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, nothing at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her smile, Keiki just responded, "Fujimoto-san really likes teaching other people, huh," as dense as always. However-</p>
<p class="null-p">While they were enjoying their time together like this, several people were peeking at them from the shadow of a bookshelf.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Recently, it feels like Keiki-senpai and Ayano-senpai have gotten a bit too close, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I was thinking, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how close they are because of their student council work, this amount is clearly unreasonable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Very suspicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">The people exchanging short statements were Yuika, Mizuha, Mao, and Sayuki. Or, in short, the female members of the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, Nii-san has been busy with his student council work. Thanks to that, his grades seemed to have dropped, and that's why he asked Fujimoto- san for help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But would you go this far because of such a reason?" "Very suspicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai, can you say anything else other than that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki's and Ayano's sudden growth and familiarity was indeed a bit suspicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika definitely thinks that Fujimoto-senpai has some sort of ulterior motive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you really help a boy you don't have any feelings for, Mizuha- senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… Probably not, no."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what Yuika is talking about."</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, Yuika wanted to bring up the possibility that Fujimoto Ayano was trying to seduce Kiryuu Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, even if that is the case, things won't go south even if we leave them alone. Once I pay back the debt, Keiki-kun will come back to the calligraphy club anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you sure about that?" "…? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Keiki-senpai were to get even closer to Fujimoto-senpai, he might decide to stay in the student council even if you pay back the debt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's hypothesis made Sayuki gulp in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But, Keiki-kun is a calligraphy club member first and foremost, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's nothing more than a ghost member. There's nothing that would keep him from leaving the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was completely true. If Keiki chose the student council, neither Sayuki nor anybody else from the club had any power to stop him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why we have to prevent that from happening at all costs!" "This is our revenge for the bunny girl time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I agree. We can't let the student council have their way with Kiryuu." While three of the girls steeled their resolve,</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'll pass on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki didn't join in, and instead walked away from that place. "What's wrong with Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Normally, she'd be the first one to join in." "Maybe she's just busy with her part-time job?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three tried to figure out why the club president gave up on their plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it doesn't matter. Even without Witch-senpai, Yuika and the others will just take Kiryuu-senpai back themselves!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Steeling their pride as girls, they vowed to not let this dense protagonist be taken by the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day after classes, inside the 2B classroom after most of their classmates had left, Mao was nervously clicking her pen. She was currently working on a new doujinshi storyboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… It feels like I'm getting stuck a lot recently…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like she had seen this development before, or like the existing characters couldn't move the story forward by themselves. She was contemplating adding a new character to bring in a fresh viewpoint.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But setting that aside for now, I managed to draw this part here pretty good… Ufufu… Ufufufufu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not laugh like that in public places?" "Who?! …Ah, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's good that you're enthusiastic about your work, but make sure that the guys from class don't find out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">She shouldn't forget about her surroundings, even if she was focusing on her work. Keiki didn't even want to imagine what would happen if the school found out about her BL manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why did you call me here today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To call Keiki over here was of course a part of the 'Recapture Keiki Operation'. They had to avert the worst-case scenario of having Keiki taken away by the student council at all costs. For her source material-of course, that was nothing more than a reason that she was using in front of her rivals. She just didn't want Keiki to get swarmed by any more girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that I really needed to give my thanks to Kiryuu." "For what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You helped me out when I was creating my shoujo manga storyboard, right? That's why, as thanks, I'll do anything you ask of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what if I asked you to immediately get rid of this accursed storyboard in front of you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd have to decline… And nevermind that; you're a boy, right? You have to have one or two perverted desires, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou, what the hell are you saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"L-Like I said… If Kiryuu is really adamant about it, I-I'll even let you fondle my breasts, or something like that…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao knew that Keiki had a healthy interest in breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">I know I can't win against the club prez or Mizuha, but I still am confident in my body!</p>
<p class="null-p">A boy like Kiryuu shouldn't be able to withstand this sweet invitation. Mao just had to get Keiki to promise that he'd definitely come back to the calligraphy club if he really were to cop a feel of them. However, it didn't quite go as planned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…" "Y-Yes?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki suddenly brought his body closer to hers. "…Eh? Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being overwhelmed by the sudden approach of her classmate, Mao had to take a step back, and was forced against the wall next to a window. Keiki's arms quickly moved to close off her escape routes. It was what one would call a 'kabe-don'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Kiryuu…? Y-You're a bit close?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's head started to get hot after being boxed in like this by the boy she liked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eh… A-Am I really going to get groped here?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she had actually been hoping for this, having it turn into reality was quite different. After all, she had always thought to herself, "This guy doesn't have the guts to do that sort of thing, anyway". Honestly, Mao never expected him to be this aggressive. Partially afraid because he was so manly, partially happy that he was seeing her as a woman, countless feelings were bouncing around inside Mao's head.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…" "Y-Yesh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say something as careless as that in front of a boy. If he were to get the wrong idea, you'd have a lot of trouble coming your way, and Nanjou is cute anyway, so treasure yourself a bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being told that by a straight-faced Keiki, Mao couldn't say anything back. She had completely lost against this surprise attack. Her heart was beating like crazy, and she could only stare at the boy's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she realized it, she gave him a slight nod in reply. Even she was shocked at how easy she actually was. Though she had planned to seduce him, it ended in failure, and she only fell even more for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why is Mao-senpai the one who fell into temptation?" "I-I totally didn't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. Nii-san is really cool from time to time, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you that you've got the wrong idea?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a few minutes after the failed operation. Inside a deserted classroom, the members of the 'Recapture Keiki Operation' were holding an aftermath meeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika and Witch-senpai are always trying to seduce Keiki-senpai, after all, so of course he wouldn't be swayed by a seduction of this level."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you couldn't have told me that before I attempted it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Yuika and Mizuha had been peeking into the 2B classroom that whole time, they already knew exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, by saying that he could fondle my breasts, wasn't I totally being a female molester?! Uwaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There there, it must've been embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing as Mao was falling into despair while reminiscing about that embarrassing event, Yuika started patting her on the head. As an aside, their target was still enthusiastically learning with Ayano as of right now. At this rate, it wouldn't be much of a surprise if they did start going out with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped, then. Next will be Yuika's turn."</p>
<p class="null-p">The next assaultant nominated herself as she got up from her chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just you watch. Yuika will punish this bad dog, and make him say 'Please let me return to the calligraphy club!'"</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's plan was perfect. First, she would call her target to the storage room in the library. She had already thought of her excuse: She had suddenly been asked to sort some books and documents, and she needed help. Of course, the kind Keiki would immediately take the bait. All that was left then would be to tie him to a chair like the last time in that locked classroom. And the usage of a certain secret weapon would do the final trick. An eye mask that she had prepared just for this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Humans gathered information through their five senses, and their sight made up for around 80% of that. If one were to rob them of their eyesight, they would have trouble even finding their way around their own house. This showed just how dependant humans were on their ability to see. Thus, if one were to rob someone of that exact ability, one could greatly inflict fear onto a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">Deducing that, Yuika was sure that her plan would definitely allow her to make Keiki her own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After tying him up, even Keiki-senpai, with his eyesight stolen, would start crying and reflect upon leaving Yuika alone… Fufufu, the plan is perfect."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, Yuika had absolutely no concerns about the plan backfiring. However</p>
<p class="null-p">-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Yuika the one who's tied up right now!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, the one who was tied to a chair was Yuika instead of her target. In the end, the complete opposite of her plans had occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being asked to sort out documents right before exams is clearly weird, and since I had a bad feeling anyway, I was already pretty wary… Not to mention, do you mind explaining what this here is about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! That's Yuika's eye mask!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what exactly were you planning on doing with that eye mask?" "…Y-Yuika is exercising her right to remain silent."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it was all a plan to get Keiki back from the student council. She certainly couldn't leak that to the target himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care if you're not going to talk, but since this is a good opportunity, I'll have Yuika reflect on her actions a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reflect-Wha?! Y-You're planning on doing this and that and other perverted things to Yuika?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, nice idea." "Hyaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hidden in Yuika's memories, the incident that had happened at the training</p>
<p class="null-p">camp came flying back to the forefront of her mind all at once. After being pushed down onto a bed by her slave candidate that had lost his reason, Keiki had his way with her. There was no way she could forget about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You really think Yuika would forgive you if you did that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to be told that by the person who prepared all of this in the first place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! H-Hey, what are you…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What followed-wasn't the perverted punishment she expected. Instead, Keki put the eye mask on Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Keiki-senpai? It's pitch black now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course it is. Ah, are you scared or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hmpf! Something like this doesn't scare Yuika at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that… Then I'll go resume my studies, so please reflect on what you did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Y-You don't mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy's footsteps grew more and more distant. And, shortly after that, she heard the sound of the door closing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No way?! Keiki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was Yuika actually left alone now? With her sight still obstructed, and nobody there to save her from this?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Y-You're still here, right? Please answer Yuika!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She screamed out, but no response came back. There was only cold silence. Apparently, she really had been left behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…H-Hmph. This isn't that much of a big deal. Yuika isn't a kid, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to rid herself of her worry, she told herself that. Exactly. This was no biggie at all. She couldn't move, or see anything, but she just had to wait a</p>
<p class="null-p">bit, and everything would be fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">…But what if Keiki-senpai won't come back?</p>
<p class="null-p">In this situation, she wouldn't even be able to visit the toilet. There was no food or water supply either. Not to mention that not many people come all the way out here, so there might not be any other chance of rescue now that the boy had left her alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Scared… Yuika is scared…</p>
<p class="null-p">The fear of not being able to move, and not being able to see. The fear of being left here for all eternity. Assaulted by countless fears, how long would she have to wait?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ten minutes? An hour? Or… even longer than that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that she had no way of knowing how much time had passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Is Yuika really going to be left alone here…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking like that, she was unable to hold back her emotions. "Uuuu… Waaaaah, Keiki-senpaaaaai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayo~" "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Yuika thought she heard a warm voice, her sight returned. And, the person that saved her from the pitch black darkness was none other than-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki… Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like you've reflected on your behaviour, so your punishment will end here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You've been here this whole time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, I was studying some English vocabulary in the meantime." "…Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika puffed out her cheeks and let out a childish groan as she glared at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why was Yuika the one who cried?" "Yuika wasn't crying!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. Nii-san is pretty scary when he gets mad." "Yuik wasn't crying, though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a few minutes after Yuika's operation had been deemed a failure. In the same free classroom, another post-mission meeting was held.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that Keiki-senpai would counterattack like that…" "Maybe Nii-san has gotten used to how we do things at this point." "Kiryuu has gone through a lot recently, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-senpai shouldn't be the one to talk all high and mighty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki seemed to have been growing in his own way, since he was constantly surrounded by these perverted girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But at this rate, it will be difficult to win Keiki-senpai over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If even my appeal didn't work, then nothing I do will change anything." "That only leaves us with-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's gaze wandered across the table towards Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't look like Witch-senpai will be of any use right now, so we can only hope on Mizuha-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got it. Leave it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Will this really be okay? If her bonds were to break, what would happen…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Attacking her older brother at night, having her older brother put on her panties… She might look rather docile, but she had quite the beast hidden inside of her. Thinking that, Mao could only worry in anticipation about what kind of tricks Mizuha would use.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 5:</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after, Mizuha started acting. Her battlefield was the living room of their home. While Keiki was studying for tomorrow's exams, Mizuha handed him a glass with something to drink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about some café au lait to go with your studies?" "Ohh, thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Accepting the glass, Keiki took a deep drink of it. "Wow, this is really delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? How about some more?" "I guess I can drink another glass." "Very well."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the boy gulped down his third glass. Watching that happen from the side, Mizuha gave a slight smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fufu, what a cute Nii-san. Gulping down the fake café au lait, not knowing that it's actually a special drink filled with a drug.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a drug for heightening your vitality and stamina, and special energizer that heightens your sexual drive. In short, an aphrodisiac. Using a recipe she found online, Mizuha had managed to create this terrifying potion. To hide</p>
<p class="null-p">the taste, she mixed it with some café au lait. With this, her older brother surely would lose his will to resist, and he would attack her to his heart's desire. A very simple, yet effective plan from the carnivorous Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">When NIi-san falls head over heels for me, he'll definitely come back to the calligraphy club, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">To achieve her goal, the girl Kiryuu Mizuha would use whatever underhanded methods were at her disposal. Still, normally she wasn't the kind of person who would do this. However, seeing as how the danger of Ayano stealing Keiki away kept rising, she could no longer sit still. To sum it up, out of jealousy and worry for losing the person she loved the most, Mizuha lost her ability to think this through, and went rampant, so to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm? Ah? My body suddenly feels so heavy…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A short while after Keiki had finished downing the third glass, it seemed like the drug had finally started taking effect. The boy's cheeks started turning red as he was holding his pen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder why… Mizuha suddenly looks really cute…" "R-Really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the result seemed even better than expected, Mizuha made a victory pose inside her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…" "Eh? …Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when she realized that she was being wrapped in Keiki's arms, he had already pushed her down on the couch. His grip alone showed that he won't let go no matter what, and Mizuha started blushing furiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nii-san… I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Imagining what was about to happen, her heartbeat accelerated. So much so that it started to hurt, and a little worry, and a lot of anticipation were filling</p>
<p class="null-p">her body- "……Sleepy." "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why she never anticipated such a development. In front of Mizua's squinting eyes, the boy lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah…? Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His arms and the rest of his body were devoid of strength. "He fell asleep…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A spectacular failure. Maybe the drink was too effective? "Really, Nii-san is so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how much did he need to make his little sister worry before he would be satisfied? He had been friendly with so many girls, and recently even the ones from the student council. Just by merely imagining him choosing one of them instead of her sent a sharp pain through her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But Nii-san's sleeping face belongs to me, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She gently ran her fingers across the sound-asleep Keiki's cheeks. Though she hated that she was still only his little sister, there were benefits that she had over everyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, how long are you going to sleep anyway, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she didn't know the answer to that, so to make sure that he wouldn't catch a cold, she brought a blanket over from the guest room and gently spread it over Keiki's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll go sleep too… Ahh, I have to take a shower first, though." Though she already had taken a bath before, being hugged that intensely by</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had made her work up a bit of sweat again. Since she was a hygiene fanatic, there was no way Mizuha could fall sleep while feeling like that. She headed to the dressing room connected to the bathroom in order to take a shower. When she did, she found 'that' lying on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really Nii-san… you have to put them in the basket."</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to the basket for dirty laundry, Mizuha spotted a pair of Keiki's underwear. Just by thinking that they belonged to the boy she loved so very much, she was entranced by them. Normally, she'd pick them up, wash them, and bring them back to his room. However, today's circumstances were a bit different.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san was wearing these today, right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to take her eyes away from the underwear, her gaze turned into that of desire. After all, her latent desires had not at all been satisfied. To be blunt, she felt really horny. She had been embraced by the person she liked, and said person fell asleep before meeting her expectations. Of course she'd be a bit pent-up. That was why she was unable to withstand her desire this very moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A bit should be fine… right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she had promised to never do it again, humans were always the kind of creature that sought to break whatever boundaries were set up. Not to mention that it was her Nii-san's fault that she felt like this to begin with.</p>
<p class="null-p">Deciding to use that as her excuse, Mizuha steeled her resolve, and rubbed her nose against the underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it was because he took a bath every day, but the smell was rather faint. Only the slightest scent of sweat. But she still became incredibly excited by merely imagining that her older brother had been wearing the underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… is this… weird feeling…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her head felt fuzzy, and her body felt like it was twitching all over. Maybe this was what cats felt when they were eating catnip. And while she was indulging herself even more in this feeling of bliss-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaah, my head hurts for some reason…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Holding his head with one hand, the awake Keiki entered the dressing room. He probably wanted to wash his face, with the worst possible timing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His little sister, frozen in place while holding his underwear to her nose, entered his field of view. His face went pale in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, umm… Are you enjoying yourself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Muttering that mysterious question, he closed the door again. "Nii-saaaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, no matter how often his teary-eyed little sister called for him, the older brother wouldn't step out of his room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just want to disappear…" "Are you okay, Mizuha-senpai?" "Did something happen?" "Please, don't ask…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The horrendous night had ended, and it was currently the first day of midterms, late in the afternoon. Yuika and Mao were once more sitting in an empty classroom when Mizuha joined them, hiding her bright red face in her hands. Of course, she couldn't tell the two of them about what had happened yesterday. Just thinking back to it made her face burn up in shame, and if there was a hole nearby, she would have hid there for all of eternity.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, the three girls hadn't managed to recapture Keiki, meaning their</p>
<p class="null-p">operation was a complete failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, in the end, club prez didn't help us out at all." "Is she really that busy with her part-time job?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't she just tired because all the nutrition immediately rushes to her chest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the contents of what she said were blatantly meant as an attack, Yuika's expression was still one of concern. And that was the same for Mao and Mizuha. A feeling of something lacking resonated between the three of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 6:</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had been acting rather weird as of recently. The first time Keiki felt like something was off was the second consecutive day of midterms, a bit past noon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Sayuki-senpai?" "Ah, Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he went to buy some juice from the vending machine after the tests had ended, he was greeted by a familiar looking, black-haired beauty, reaching to press the button for strawberry milk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What is it? Are you going to say that strawberry milk is for kids?" "Nobody thought anything like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though her pouting gesture did indeed look a bit childish. And at the same time, Keiki thought that this was cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll take some strawberry milk as well. I need some protein since I'm so tired from exams."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did you do today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to Fujimoto-san looking after my studies, I'd say I did pretty good." "I see… Good for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking out the pack of milk, Sayuki averted her gaze. She ran her fingers through her long, glossy hair, looking like she was troubled by something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing at all… I have to change classes, so I'll be on my way." "Ah, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without waiting for Keiki's response, the girl quickly separated from him and walked away. Watching her grow more distant, her last words once more ran through his thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wait. We have exams, so why would she have to switch classes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That aside, today's exams had already ended. Now that Keiki thought about it, what she had said just now was nothing more than a bad excuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is Sayuki-senpai avoiding me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the chances for that seemed rather high, Keiki couldn't find anything in his memories that would have acted as the trigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That only leaves… that. A girl's day."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not realizing at all how arriving at that conclusion made him the actual worst, he decided to use that reasoning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 7:</p>
<p class="null-p">Though midterms were finally over, there was still no time to relax. "That being said, the culture festival is this weekend, and it's one of the</p>
<p class="null-p">bigger events we have to worry about. We'll be even more busy than ever, so let's do our best with our job!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the days of the culture festival grew closer, the student council would obviously get more work. Though they did their best to prepare for most of it, there were always sudden things that came up and preparations that they could only do right beforehand, so they always appreciated every helping hand. Since the president and vice president had experience with this great undertaking, Shiho would look after the first-years Rin and Airi, while Ayano would be the person helping guide Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani, the position of the seal here is one millimeter off." "One millimeter… Isn't Ai-chan a bit too particular?" "Don't complain. Keep going. And don't call me Ai-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">The first-year students were stamping various documents that needed approval.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We only need two tables for the stage, okay? They're big, so make sure to carry them together."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho was borrowing equipment and other furniture from the storage room. "There didn't seem to be any problems from the gardening club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, the club president is keeping it organized over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano and Keiki were checking various clubs, making sure their preparations were moving according to what they had proposed. With that, every single member was working with one goal in mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, let's take a quick break?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But we still have to go around to the rest of the clubs?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we take a break now, we can work more efficiently later." "Then let's do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a Wednesday, after classes had ended, with three days left until the big culture festival. Keiki decided to go along with Ayano's proposal, and they went to buy some juice from a vending machine in the courtyard. A lot of students were still at school because of their preparations, and the school grounds were fairly crowded. Listening to the background din, the two of them sat down on a bench in the shadow of a tree. Ayano suddenly spoke up and asked Keiki a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is the calligraphy club not showing any of their works?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We did last year, but Sayuki-senpai is busy with her part-time work right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will she be able to pay the debt back in time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it should be okay. It looks like Sayuki-senpai is working pretty hard, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Keiki had become a provisional member of the student council was because of the bunny girl outfit incident. Until the debt was paid back in full, he would have to stay. That was the condition. That meant that as soon as the debt was repaid, he wasn't obligated to help them anymore. Once he could leave, he'd get to spend a rowdy time with the others again, all the while trying to move his 'De-Perversion Plan' forward. There were many things still left undone in the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Even so, why am I hesitating like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, Ayano's words from when they were cleaning the pool came back to him. That day, she had voiced her desire for Keiki to stay in the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a matter of fact, being in the student council was very pleasant for him. He didn't have to fight against the perverted girls all the time; there was only Ayano. Unlike some other girls, she wouldn't stuff her panties into his mouth, use him as a model for a BL manga, and so on. Airi's yuri hobby wasn't exactly harmful for him either. Rintarou, or Mitani Rin, wearing female clothes in the clubroom was a sight for sore eyes since he looked like</p>
<p class="null-p">a beauty (sadly). Not to mention that Shiho was a kind, relaxing Onee-san type. And, more than anything else, as for Keiki himself, he felt happy being needed like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have to come up with my answer before the debt is completely repaid…</p>
<p class="null-p">Return to the calligraphy club, like he had originally planned, or become a full-fledged member of the student council. If he were to stay in the student council, he certainly couldn't show his face around the calligraphy club anymore. In the end, it was a choice between the student council members and the calligraphy club members. Still, deciding right on the spot wouldn't do him any good, so he took the third option, and decided to wait a little while longer before giving his answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Fujimoto-san, thank you for helping me with my exam studies. Thanks to that, I got even better grades than ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're very welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You must be in the top ten, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, Ayano-san here is ranked third in her grade." "Third?! That's pretty amazing, you know?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew that her grades were top-notch, but that still was quite a shock. Not to mention that Ayano looked really cute while she made a V sign with her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This time was a bit special. Thanks to Kiryuu-kun, I was working harder than usual."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I do something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was fully charged every day thanks to you." "Am I some sort of portable battery?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pretty close, I'd say."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking Keiki's retort as a joke, Ayano gave a heartfelt giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, Fujimoto-san really is amazing. You still get such good grades even when you're so busy with the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll get really embarrassed if you praise me like that…" "Then I'll stop doing that from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's no good. This Ayano-san here gets as happy as a child if you praise her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano looked at Keiki, eyes filled with expectation. Seeing that, Keiki put his hand on her head, patting her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There there, good girl." "Mm… Ehehehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">The vice president gave a content laugh in response. Thinking back to it, Keiki's distance with Ayano had been quite close even before he started working for the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun? What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh… I just thought I saw Sayuki-senpai at that window over there." But the moment their eyes met, the girl immediately walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, she'd always barge in when she saw Ayano and me like this…</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki always viewed Ayano as a rival. She would always act like her cute Kouhai was being taken away by some spoiled cat, and they would always start fighting. When Keiki helped out with the volunteer garbage gathering, and when they were at the sports festival, they were rather open about their</p>
<p class="null-p">rivalry. That was exactly why Keiki couldn't help but think that something was off, after seeing her react like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai really is acting weird…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like back then when midterms ended. The Sayuki that Keiki treasured was always full of energy, always getting angry at the smallest things, and always laughing at the smallest things. Even so, her expression that moment ago could only be described as 'sadness' or 'loneliness'. And of course, Keiki couldn't just ignore her after seeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time was now around 8pm. Keiki was standing on the dark night street, wearing his uniform. The location was just outside the family restaurant where Sayuki was working. After his job in the student council came to an end, instead of going home immediately, he had now been waiting for over an hour for the black-haired upperclassman to come out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's getting really chilly now around this time of day."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was close to changing to November now, so it was natural for the nights to start getting colder and colder. The coldness he felt was also in the sense of the club budget debt and the looming time limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was thinking about that, the people passing him by were growing fewer and fewer in number, until even the sound of the city almost disappeared. Finally, having changed into her uniform, Sayuki stepped out of the family restaurant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, good work today." "…Eh? Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When someone she didn't expect to see called her out, she was lost as to what to do. Shortly after, as if she had remembered something, her expression turned into that of displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard from Mizuha and the others that you were busy until late because of</p>
<p class="null-p">your part-time job. So I thought I'd escort you home." "I'm not a kid anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But letting a girl walk home alone at this hour is too dangerous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Walking home with a boy next to me at this hour is equally dangerous, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't do anything to make Sayuki-senpai hate me." "…Just do what you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">Giving a tsundere response, Sayuki started walking. Keiki took that as her giving him permission, and he walked beside her while looking at her profile. Maybe it was because of the job, but she didn't seem as energetic as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, you're tired, aren't you? We have school tomorrow, so let's hurry home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why is Keiki-kun the one to take the lead? No, I'm totally fine with that if you'd put a collar on me and then take the lead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I did that, the police would take the lead and stuff me into their car."</p>
<p class="null-p">As their conversation continued like that, their usual atmosphere started to return. All the while, they kept walking towards the girl's home through the city at night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, the deadline for the debt to be repaid is pretty soon, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once you get your pay, club activities can finally return back to normal." "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki suddenly stopped beneath the light of a street lamp.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki turned around in bewilderment, and the girl started confessing. "About that… Something bad happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I just got fired from my job." "Ohhh, so you just got fired- Ehhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't hold back his shock, and let out a scream that disappeared into the night sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's a joke, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, how nice it'd be if that was a joke." "…Seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Super seriously."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what in the world happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I broke some precious plates and such during my shift, and of course, the manager got mad at me, saying that I was fired. Not to mention that the plates I broke were worth more than what I would get from my work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her job at the family restaurant was the only way for the girl to earn money quickly enough to repay the debt. She had even started weekend shifts just so that she could protect the calligraphy club she treasured so much, and now all of that was for naught.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Telling me not to bother coming in tomorrow, what kind of TV drama is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't something to laugh about!" Keiki unconsciously shouted at her in anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you going to do about the debt then?! If you don't manage to pay it back this month, the calligraphy club will really get disbanded, you know?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the matter wouldn't be settled by just getting angry, he couldn't hold himself back, now that the club disbandment was looming near.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason I was fired is all because of Keiki-kun, isn't it?!" "What…? Why would it be my fault?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're suddenly so close to Fujimoto-san, looking like you're having the time of your life while studying with her, and even patting her head in the courtyard! Even though you have me as your pet, you get all lovey-dovey with some other pig! Of course I wouldn't be able to focus on my work!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that?! You're just taking out your anger on me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not doing anything! Keiki-kun should thinking about a girl's feelings a bit more!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't like they were fighting. Even so, the words that came out of their mouths grew more harsh the longer they kept going.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you blaming other people for your own mistakes? You're completely different from a certain Fujimoto-san, who's always thinking about other people."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he brought up Ayano's name, Sayuki's expression clouded even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If you really like her that much, why don't you just stay in the student council then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For someone who doesn't understand a girl's thought process at all, maybe the student council is really a better fit for this Virgin-kun right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When those words arrived at Keiki's ears, he couldn't take them sitting down, and-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's right. Rather than being stuck in the calligraphy club with this egoistic Virgin-senpai, the student council is a much more fun and a pleasant place."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he realized it, he had already blurted out those words. Shortly afterwards, immense regret assaulted him. But he thought that it was fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was the one who started the fight, and insulting a hardcore masochist like her would only be a reward for her. Or-that's how it should have been.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? S-Sayuki-senpai…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene in front of him was completely different from what he thought would happen. Beneath the street lamp, big, round tears started building up in his Senpai's eyes and flowing down her cheeks. When he saw that, Keiki's mind went blank.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_06_15.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"…I'm going home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without giving him a chance to stop her, Sayuki dashed off. Watching her grow more distant, Keiki remembered their first meeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he first entered the school, he spotted a girl with long, black hair in the school building after classes. At that time, she had just become a second-year, lost all her senpais from the calligraphy club she treasured so much, and the club was even in danger of disbandment, and she was crying on a bench in the courtyard. Back then, he should've noticed how fragile she was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm the worst."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a girl you could never really grasp completely, who was always teasing her Kouhai, but was more fragile and delicate than anybody else.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that he was unable to read her feelings, and ended up hurting her this much, was a greater shock to Keiki than anything else before.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu-kun?" "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was called out, Keiki raised his head to find Ayano looking at him. "Were you listening just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, I was a bit lost in thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's current location was the student council room, and classes were already over for the day. The other three members were currently off performing their own duties, so currently it was just Ayano and Keiki in the room, working on the schedule for the upcoming culture festival.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun is a bit weird today. Like your head is in the clouds or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not that fun, trust me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're tired, we can take a break for today…" "No, I'm fine. I'm not tired."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano's gaze was filled with concern. Keiki probably had a horrendous face today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I had a fight with Sayuki-senpai, and said something that I regret. I ended</p>
<p class="null-p">up hurting her because of that." "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And it looks like Senpai was even fired from her part-time job. At this rate, she won't be able to pay back the debt… and the club will be disbanded."</p>
<p class="null-p">The debt was supposed to be repaid during this month. That was Shiho's condition. But, as things stood, that wouldn't be possible. As a result, Sayuki would cry even more than yesterday. Keiki really hated himself for not realizing how she felt and how hard she had worked for the club. He had even hurt her to this degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Kiss."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the midst Keiki's self-loathing, he felt a soft, warm sensation on his cheek. The origin of that feeling was Ayano's lips, right next to him. Keiki was immediately thrown off guard from being suddenly kissed like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah-Fujimoto-san?! W-W-W-What are you doing?!" "Kissing you on the cheek?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because Kiryuu-kun had such a difficult expression on his face." "And that's why you kiss me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"About what?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're finally more energetic." "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though her method was a bit questionable, Keiki did indeed feel a bit better. When he understood her motive, Keiki felt even more embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to think too deeply into it. Just find the answer for yourself." "But, what should I do now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, what do you want to do?" "What do I… want to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. What do you want to do, Kiryuu-kun?" "I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Ayano asked him this, Keiki finally understood. He was only looking at Sayuki's sad future, and he had already subconsciously given up on the calligraphy club. What he wanted all along was for the girl to smile, so the answer was simple from the very start-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want the calligraphy club to be disbanded." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want Sayuki-senpai to be sad." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing his response, Ayano gave a kind smile. "Then there's only one thing to do, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She gave the lost child one final push. If he made her cry before, he just had to make sure that she would never again do so. If he gave up now, he'd lose his last chance. And now that he decided that, he knew what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Fujimoto-san. I have some urgent business, so can I leave early?" "Yeah, I can do the rest myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Picking up his bag, Keiki dashed out of the student council office. Left alone in the student council room, Ayano let out a quiet "I lost, huh?" which would never arrive at anyone's ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the student council office behind him, he sent an email out to the other three members of the calligraphy club, which contained the short message 'Can you come to the calligraphy club room right now?'. Shortly afterwards, the girls had gathered in front of the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you suddenly call us here for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not sure what your idea with this is, but I have to work on my manuscript, so I don't have much time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, Mao, and Mizuha all inundated him with questions. Though they all phrased it differently, it was apparent that they were all worried in some way or another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for coming so suddenly. Let's talk inside."</p>
<p class="null-p">Opening the door, Keiki stepped in, followed by the other three. Though it had been a while since he had last been in there, it still felt like it was yesterday. After waiting for the girls to take their seats, Keiki stood in front of the table and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be frank. The club is in huge trouble." "Trouble?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The club is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the girls all voiced their doubts,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai was fired from her part-time job at the family restaurant. Not to mention that she has to come up with money to replace the things she broke, and the money will be deducted from her pay so far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the girls heard the details, they all lost whatever words they had in them. Yuika recovered the fastest, and looked straight at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Is this some kind of bad joke?" "I know how you feel, but it sadly is not."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if she can't get her pay from the job…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, at this rate, she won't be able to pay back the debt, and the calligraphy club will be disbanded."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kouhai seemed to have accepted this as reality, and the shock was visible on her expression. Mizuha and Mao had similar expressions on their faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, when is the debt due by?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our time limit is the 31st of this month. Tuesday of next week." "We don't even have one week left…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have the culture festival on Saturday, too, so finding a new job in time now would be difficult now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was already Thursday, and just as Mizuha stated, the culture festival would start the day after tomorrow. Once that ended, it was almost time for judgement day. They didn't have the time to search for a job anymore. To stop the club from disbanding, they had to come up with a way to pay back the money that Sayuki owed, the 25.000 yen, before then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what is Witch-senpai doing now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai… We got into a fight yesterday, and because I made her cry, I don't think she'll be of much use…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…" "Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, what are you even doing?" "I really feel bad about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that he had made her cry with the words he blurted out in rage. But he didn't have the time to dwell on that now. Instead, he had to focus on solving this problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll do something about Sayuki-senpai myself… Other than that, I have a request for all of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the main topic for the day. In order to protect something dear to him, in order to grasp the future he wished for, he made up his mind, and spoke the following words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want the calligraphy club to be disbanded… But I don't have the strength to prevent that on my own. That's why I want everyone's help."</p>
<p class="null-p">Facing the girls head-on while declaring his feelings, Keiki received three smiles in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just tell me what I have to do. After all, it's for the calligraphy club, and for Tokihara-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too. It'd be troublesome if I couldn't keep writing on my manuscript in the clubroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Earning herself a favour from Witch-senpai isn't that bad of a deal for Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone… Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like everyone else also had similar feelings about the calligraphy club. When he saw that, Keiki was close to tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what do Yuika and the others have to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I've already thought of a plan," said the boy, with a confident expression on his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The three girls waited in anticipation for the dependable boy's proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just as I said before, we don't have much time left. Searching for a job at this point in time wouldn't work, so we have to earn the money in a different way. And for that-"</p>
<p class="null-p">To save the club from the impending danger, Keiki spoke aloud the one and only method he could think of.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want everyone to wear erotic maid costumes!" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, the smiles completely disappeared from the girls' expressions. And all their gazes basically screamed out:</p>
<p class="null-p">'What is this guy talking about?!'</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">How did you like Hensuki volume 6?</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, the rest of the student council was introduced, and they've already turned into a vital plot point. Seeing the newly introduced student council president and secretary, Keiki's surroundings have only gotten more crazy than ever. Personally, I'm also happy that I got to bring Ayano-san more into the foreground after she's been kind of absent recently.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sure that I wasn't the only one who was charmed by her. I mean, I knew that the white one piece would suit her, but to this level… I also want to get sniffed by this cute Ayano-san (LOL). Thinking back on it, a lot has happened in the 6th installment (*From here on out, it's spoiler time*)</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki-senpai got happy about getting her butt spanked, Mao turned into a female molester, Yuika had to suffer through a bondage roleplay, and Mizuha got caught sniffing her older brother's panties… But let's not forget about the nurse's full name suddenly appearing like that. We didn't even have Okita- sensei's full name yet. What's that about?</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, for those who want to see what this Tachibana Kaori-san looks like, then please take a look at the second volume of the comicalization, which will be released in the early stages of November (Shameless self- advertising).</p>
<p class="null-p">Also as another side note, at the same time as this volume 6 is released, new wall banners and other goods of the 'Hensuki' series will be released. Really, I soon won't have any more space in my room for all these goods (And I'm still happy about it). I guess I'll have to put some stuff into boxes to make room for the new stuff.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, the topic is devolving into something else entirely now, but now that I've finished this volume, that makes it the 10th book I've completed. I've been able to continue writing like the authors I looked up to in my student days, and I cannot thank you enough for supporting the Hensuki series to such a degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, let us meet again in the 7th installment of Hensuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hanama Tomo</p>
