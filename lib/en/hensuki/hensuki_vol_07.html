<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">"For the sake of money, I want you girls to wear perverted maid costumes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">On a Wednesday near the end of the month of November, inside the calligraphy clubroom. Kiryuu Keiki was the one who blurted out that monster of a phrase.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, that earned him cold glares from the other three-female- members of the club. And the first one to get back on topic was Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, you want Yuika to work in one of those shady night clubs or something? Serving some middle-aged man with her body?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san… that's a bit cruel if you ask me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think that Kiryuu could sink that low."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuika's complaint, Mizuha and Mao followed suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know what you're thinking, but you're wrong, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, would you mind explaining? How would making Yuika wear a maid uniform stop the club from being disbanded?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't just asking them to wear maid uniforms for his own entertainment. "Our calligraphy club will open up a maid cafe at this very culture festival!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maid cafe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To save the club from getting disbanded, we have to make enough money to repay the debt in time. Because of that, we'll open up a shop at the culture festival, and earn enough money through that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of four bunny girl suits that had been bought using the club budget, every girl that owned one here had to repay their share of 25.000 yen. And everyone except for Sayuki had already done that. However, the problem was that Sayuki had just been fired from her part-time job at a family restaurant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the deadline to repay the debt was approaching fast, they didn't have enough time to look for part-time jobs themselves. That was why Keiki thought of doing a maid cafe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. We have to earn it through the culture festival if she can't get it from the part-time job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika understands that opening up a shop makes sense, but why can't it be just a normal cafe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enjoying the festival is good and all, but this time, we have to earn as much money as we can. In order to gather as many customers as possible, we can't miss out on using maid uniforms."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Nii-san, will we really get more customers by wearing maid uniforms?" "Of course. Maid uniforms are a man's romance!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though they all had their perverted attributes, the girls from the calligraphy club were without a doubt beauties in their own right. If they were to put on cute and erotic maid uniforms, the customers should come flocking in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, to open a cafe, we'll need permission first, right? Will we be in time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll have the student council president work her way around that. Of course, while getting ourselves a room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your groundwork is moving forward so fast that it's almost scary…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before coming to the clubroom, Keiki had made phone calls to two individuals. The first one was Takasaki Shiho, the student council president, and he had gotten permission to open a store for the culture festival.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first, I thought of doing it with bunny girls, but Takasaki-senpai rejected that. She said that it would be against public morals."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course she did…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, we don't have any time to dilly-daddle. The culture festival will start in two days. We have to start our preparations right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The calligraphy club didn't have any time anymore. If they let this chance slip, they wouldn't be able to repay the debt in time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's try our best so that we can open up the maid cafe the day after tomorrow!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Keiki's enthusiasm, the girls showed resigned smiles. "You're right. We don't have any other method."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't help it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's to save the calligraphy club." "Alright. Then let's divvy up our roles."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying these words, Keiki's gaze landed upon a certain first-year student.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First, we'll have Yuika-chan make maid uniforms for Mizuha and Mao." "Yuika? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We still have the one that Sayuki-senpai used, and she also had one made for Yuika-chan, right? That means that we only need one for Mizuha and</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao, but with the limited time we have left, we'll have to finish it in one evening. That's why I trust that Yuika-chan can do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, Yuika will do her best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koga Yuika was quite proficient when it came to sewing. There was nobody else that could finish it within this tight schedule.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha will focus on the cooking, and come up with a good menu. It doesn't have to be much, and while you're at it, make sure that the ingredients are as cheap as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Got it, leave it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Mizuha's older brother Keiki knew very well of her amazing cooking skills. So much so that he had no concerns about letting her handle the food supply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou, I'd like you to draw the advertisement posters and so on." "Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And don't draw some naked dudes by accident." "I-I won't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou Mao's drawings certainly wouldn't lose to the pros out there. That was why Keiki decided to leave the advertisement to her, hoping that she wouldn't accidentally draw some BL on them by mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what is Keiki-senpai going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm, I guess I'm sort of like a producer. I do have my job at the student council too, after all, but I'll try to come over as often as I can."</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, Keiki was working as a temporary student council member, because that was the condition for the student council president to hold off on disbanding the calligraphy club. Normally, he would be working over there right now as well, but he had received permission from the vice president to</p>
<p class="null-p">take some time off. Thanks to that, he managed to gather the members here for this emergency meeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All that's left is to make up with Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki, the present of the calligraphy club, was currently not present. Probably because of their fight yesterday, she wouldn't respond when Keiki contacted her. Without her being here, the club felt like a jigsaw puzzle that was missing a piece, and Keiki felt a bit lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be a lie for Keiki to say that he wasn't worried still. He was still worried if he could work his way through like a producer, or if the calligraphy club's maid cafe would bring enough financial success. But he didn't have the time to hesitate. In order to make sure that he could once again see the smile of a person he treasured, he decided not to give up this future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, everyone, start your preparations!" "Roger!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Make the maid cafe a success, and save the club from disbandment. Everyone had the same goal in mind, and they started moving forward.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: A sleepover comes sudden</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">With curtains closed, and darkness filling the room, Sayuki was lying on her bed. She was still wearing her pyjamas. Nobody knew how much time she had passed in this situation. The incident of the previous night was the trigger for this, but instead of working towards solving this situation, she was just postponing the necessary confrontation. Whether it be the calligraphy club, or Keiki, nothing at all had been cleared up as of yet-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a sigh, she rested her head on her pillow. Inside this dark room, the screen of her smartphone suddenly lit up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Another call."</p>
<p class="null-p">For a while now, her smartphone would start vibrating for a few seconds, but the girl showed no intention of answering. Just like yesterday, when she had run away after seeing Keiki pat Ayano on the head, she ran away once again.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Of course I'd get jealous after seeing something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kouhai she was interested in was being lovey-dovey with another girl. Not being able to keep a calm mind, she was careless later at her job and dropped some expensive tableware, which got her fired right on the spot. Not to mention that, even though he came later to greet her out of concern, she made Keiki mad as a result.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What am I even doing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She hated it when he pat someone else on the head instead of her. Mizuha was his little sister, so that was something different, but there was also Yuika and Ayano. She wanted to become Keiki's pet, and she couldn't stand it when he was being kind to someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-kun looked like he had fun with Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Yuika had previously stated, at his rate, there was no guarantee that the boy would return upon the debt finally being repaid. Of course, she didn't want that. She didn't want her master candidate to be taken by the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I don't have any right to monopolize Keiki…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who made Keiki take the role of a temporary student council member was no one other than Sayuki herself. From misusing the club budget, to separating him from the club-everything happened because of her own actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she even have the right to ask him to come back?</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why Sayuki didn't partake in the mission that Yuika and the others conducted was also because of that doubt. Even so, when Keiki told her that he preferred the student council, it felt like a sharp blade ran through her chest. She wouldn't open the emails she received because she was simply afraid. What if one was from Keiki, saying 'I decided to join the student council'? A last goodbye? Thinking that, she lost all her energy to so much as move her body over to check. Even though staying like this wouldn't change</p>
<p class="null-p">anything at all… Even though at this rate, she would lose her precious calligraphy club…</p>
<p class="null-p">Imagining the impending future, tears once more started building up in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-kun can just stay a virgin for the rest of his life." Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I really can't get in touch with Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">An hour after the emergency meeting in the clubroom, a little bit past 6pm. He went home, changed out of his school uniform, and was now sitting in his living room, trying to get through to the black-haired upperclassman. Not to mention that she wasn't anywhere to be found at school today. The apron- wearing Mizuha called out to him as she cut cabbage in the kitchen corner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, what did you even say to Tokihara-senpai?" "Ahh, well… I called her 'Virgin-senpai'…" "Ahhh… That's Nii-san's fault then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, she called me 'Virgin-kun' too, you know?" "Ohh, you're both at fault, then. That's unexpected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't think that was why she got angry at me, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wasn't the kind of person who would fly into a rage from being called a virgin. What probably hurt her was the phrase "I prefer the student council over the calligraphy club", which was denying her most important place-</p>
<p class="null-p">I really am the worst, huh…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever the circumstances, Keiki did make the girl cry. Just remembering that made his chest feel heavy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd be great if she came back soon, though." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd be great if you could make up soon." "Yeah, that's why I'm working hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">How convenient it would be to erase your past mistakes. Sadly, this was reality, so all he could do was to make sure that the girl could laugh in the near future, and beyond that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for not giving you any more time to work on the menu. Can you pull through?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I thought that reheated things would be best. Or something that's easy to make. Like yakisoba, okonomiyaki, and so forth. If I have the ingredients I need, it doesn't take too long to make them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of maid cafés, omurice is a staple, right?" "Ah, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting down the knife she was cutting the vegetables with, Mizuha started writing in a small notebook. As if she remembered something, she lifted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, what should we do with the ingredients on that day? Asking a supplier now would be too late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem about that. Koharu-senpai will bring them in her car." "Eh? Ootori-senpai's gonna drive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, the Ootori household chauffeur will do the driving. Driving would be pretty impossible for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, considering her age, she might already have a license, but that was another matter for another time. After receiving permission from the student</p>
<p class="null-p">council president, Keiki called Koharu, and she offered to do the heavy lifting. She was a really kind Senpai, and Keiki was glad that he met her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, I'll have you go shopping with Koharu-senpai tomorrow. I'm sure that it'll be heavy, but Shouma will be there to help, so don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" "Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no… I was just a bit surprised because Nii-san was thinking through this so thoroughly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been working as part of the student council for a while now after all. I've gotten used to preparing everything before the actual job, is all."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the always-busy student council, Keiki's first hurdle was to learn how to work efficiently. If he didn't do it like this, they wouldn't make it in time for the culture festival.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll do my best with the menu." "I'm counting on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two siblings laughed. And with perfect timing, the doorbell rang, signaling that a guest had arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, looks like she's here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Getting up from his seat, Keiki made his way towards the door. When he opened it, he was greeted by two girls who were holding huge bags.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heyho…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will be in your care today."</p>
<p class="null-p">One was Nanjou Mao, wearing jeans, and the other was the skirt-wearing Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…The gods really are unfair."</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, inside the Kiryuu household's living room. Tape measure in hand, Yuika was voicing her complaints as she measured Mizuha's bust size.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…? Why do the gods have to split up breasts into big ones and small ones?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are also people in between, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everything looks big from Yuika's point of view," said the blonde-haired beauty with a sigh, as she looked down at her own chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone with big breasts was her enemy. Even Mizuha, who didn't look that big when she was wearing clothes. It was enough to make Yuika burn with jealousy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-senpai is so kind and beautiful, and she even has big breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan's eyes and hair are just as beautiful, and your small stature is what makes you even more cute as a girl, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah… T-Thank you very much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of Mizuha's abrupt counterattack (?), Yuika suddenly lost her poisonous tongue. Meanwhile, she also resumed her work, and took various measurements of Mizuha's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… Fu, ah, that tickles, Yuika-chan." "Ah, no moving please."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">It seemed as if Yuika's hands were running across some of Mizuha's more sensitive areas, because her body twitched a bit at times. Keiki and Mao were sitting on the nearby sofa, watching this rather pleasant scene unfold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never knew that taking measurements on top of your clothes was also okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You thought we'd do this in our underwear? Pervert." "I've just been called 'pervert' by a pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I didn't think that I'd be staying over at your house this suddenly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We don't have much time until the culture festival, after all. It'd definitely be more efficient to have everyone in the same place, and if there's some problem that comes up, we can deal with it immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the meeting in the clubroom, Keiki brought up the proposal of a sleepover for efficiency reasons. Yuika would need Mao's and Mizuha's measurements anyway for the maid uniforms she would be working on, and the girls didn't seem to be against it either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if it were just Mizuha and me, God knows what would've happened." "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, you'll see soon enough, I'm afraid." "What are you so afraid of…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though his classmate still was a bit dubious, "Then next is Mao-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With perfect timing, Yuika finished taking Mizuha's measurements. As she got up, she threw Keiki a rather distrustful glare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, don't look at my measurements, okay?" "I won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't trust the words of a lucky pervert master." "What does that even mean?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of answering, however, Mao walked over towards Yuika, only giving out a short "Hmph" in response to Keiki's confusion. After switching with her, now it was Mizuha's turn to sit next to her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, Yuika-chan was really measuring me a lot." "Was it fun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, it's been a while since our house has been this lively." "…You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the Kiryuu parents were often busy with their jobs, the siblings were alone most of the time. It had really been a long time since their house felt this hectic. Not to mention that Keiki himself felt even more happy about it, after seeing Mizuha so cheerful. And it seemed like Mizuha wasn't the only person who agreed-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm hm hm~~~ Okay, Mao-senpai, please lift up your arms~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Beyond the siblings' gaze was a clearly-pleased Yuika, who was working to take Mao's measurements. Maybe it was because she liked making clothes, or maybe it was because she enjoyed taking measurements. Nobody knew. But, instead of asking about that, Mao opened her mouth to bring up a different matter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm, Yuika?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, can't you make my skirt a bit longer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? No can do. We're all in this embarrassing thing together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you accept my request, I'll give you a treasured BL book of mine. How about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will you give it a rest?!" "Ouch?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving a chop on the head from Keiki, who had gotten up and walked over to her, Mao held her head in her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't you dare go into a fujoshi trade-off with my Kouhai." "Hmph… but don't make it too short… It's really embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Says the gyaru with the super short skirt?" "Uniform and maid clothes are different!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki didn't agree at all. But he just chalked it up to the complexity of a young maiden, and moved on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, then, Yuika will intentionally make Mao-senpai's skirt a miniskirt, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please stop?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao begged, while Yuika let out a teasing laugh. Though he was happy that they were enjoying their time, he still made one additional point as their current producer-like supervisor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I said 'perverted maid', but we're still on school grounds. If the costumes are too revealing, we'd get in trouble with the school, so keep it at acceptable levels."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood! Yuika will make it as short as possible!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to make it extra short, you know…" Nanjou said, letting out a defeated sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking Mao's measurements was done, the members started going about their respective jobs. Yuika started preparations for sewing the uniforms, while Mao started drawing illustrations and details on the posters. Mizuha for her part was currently coming up with a menu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to do my part as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting at the kitchen table, Keiki brought out a laptop he brought with him from his room. Although he had received permission from the student council, he still had to fill out various documents concerning rules and safety. He also had to come up with a detailed plan for their attraction by tomorrow, calculate out their pricing for the various foods and drinks so that they could make enough money, and countless other things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around an hour after they began their work- "It's a bit late. Should we have dinner now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha said with a smile as she stepped out of the kitchen. Following the chef's words, Mao and Yuika gave their respective responses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been waiting for this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-senpai's cooking is so delicious! Yuika loves it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the other girls clearly seemed excited for what was about to happen, Keiki could only mutter "So it's finally time…" Luckily, Yuika and Mao didn't know yet. What was about to happen wasn't just any normal dinner, but rather 'A banquet in hell'-</p>
<p class="null-p">"How's the taste?" "It's tasty, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This amount is a bit over the top…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once Mizuha starts coming up with new recipes and whatnot, she can't be stopped…"</p>
<p class="null-p">What was on top of the table in front of them wasn't the amount of a normal dinner: There was yakisoba, sauce-drenched okonomiyaki, and chicken rice with fluffy eggs inside the omurice. Yes, this was one of the main reasons why Keiki had decided upon a sleepover. Mizuha was the type of person who would cook endlessly until she came up with a new, satisfying recipe. Not to mention that her current job was to come up with a complete menu, so Keiki realized early on that just the Kiryuu siblings' stomachs would not be sufficient for all that was about to be cooked. This was why he had to increase the number of people present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can just keep the rest for breakfast tomorrow." "Yuika can see herself bloating up like a balloon…" "What a coincidence, me too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once I'm done eating this, I'll go clean the bath, I guess…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After their bellies were full to the brim with Mizuha's cooking, the members returned to their work. Yuika's mission to sew the uniforms was moving along smoothly, while Mao was already coloring the posters, and Mizuha was on her own taking some more notes. Keiki himself was cleaning the bath, and he returned to the living room once he finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I filled the tub. Who wants to get in first?" "Nii-san can go in first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, you were the one who cleaned it, after all." "No objections from me~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then I'll do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki wouldn't have minded being the last person to use it, the girls didn't seem to have any complaints about him going first, so he decided to do</p>
<p class="null-p">just that. After going into the dressing room, he took off his clothes and entered the bath. After washing his hair, he slowly sank his body down into the hot water.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The warmth of the water worked wonders on his tired body. But once he found himself alone like this, his thoughts started drifting towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wonder what Sayuki-senpai is doing right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she wouldn't answer his messages, she probably was still mad at him. He would've liked to meet her in person, but she wasn't coming to school either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this rate, she might not even come to school for a long time…" They might even have to do the maid cafe without her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to keep my act together…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If Keiki were to get anxious, Yuika and the others would pick up on it. He definitely couldn't let them see him in a weak state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right, I guess I'll get out for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">He still had a mountain of work left. He couldn't stay in there for any longer. He hurriedly got out the bath, put on a change of clothes, and headed towards the living room. When he arrived in front of the door, he could hear the girls' voices coming from inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Keiki-senpai really is working hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-I was really worried back when he told us to wear maid uniforms out of the blue, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Now now, that was for the sake of the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, his own name came up in the conversation. Might this possibly be</p>
<p class="null-p">-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are they talking about me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having become interested in the conversation, Keiki didn't open the door any wider, Instead, he peeked into the room through the small opening.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the three of them were taking a break, because they were currently sitting on the couch, drinking tea and talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I guess my opinion of Kiryuu has improved, if only a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ever since he started working in the student council, he's become really reliable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. But that's to be expected from Yuika's slave."</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm not your slave, though…</p>
<p class="null-p">He really wasn't, but he still felt a bit flustered by being praised like this. Mao started teasing Yuika in response to her statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He really did become reliable. After all, he did make the hardcore sadist Yuika cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika already told you that she wasn't crying! And Mao-senpai too! Why did you get all maiden-like when Keiki-senpai was approaching you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?! Who are you calling a maiden!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't remind me about the recapture operation…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming like she was remembering something, Mizuha hid her face in embarrassment. But Keiki was more interested in the term she had just used.</p>
<p class="null-p">Recapture operation…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki remembered that there was a day when all of them started acting weird for some reason. It was the first day of midterms last week.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like how Mao started blurting out unreasonable things like "You can fondle my breasts if you want!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like how Yuika was trying to conduct a bondage roleplay with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like how he had once again caught Mizuha sniffing his underwear like crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since their actions were similar to what happened every day, Keiki hadn't questioned it any further.</p>
<p class="null-p">Were they trying to take me back from the student council with that, or something…?</p>
<p class="null-p">That would explain the words 'recapture operation.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe they noticed how I was hesitating…</p>
<p class="null-p">The trigger for that was Ayano's "I want you to stay in the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">Return to the calligraphy club, or become a full-fledged member of the student council.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had hesitated for a while, but he already knew the answer deep inside. And, while Keiki once more reminisced about his own weakness, the girls' conversation diverged into a different direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Mizuha, what do you do on school-free days?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… I often clean Nii-san's room, make food for Nii-san, or take care of Nii-san's laundry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you, his mother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looking after Nii-san is something of a hobby of mine." "A hobby…? That's definitely weird, though…" "Really? I think that it's pretty normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Yuika doesn't think that it's normal at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, since we're not blood-related to begin with, we're not normal siblings, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So heavy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika didn't mean it in that way!" "Fufu, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the two girls getting flustered, Mizuha let out a giggle. She might seem rather calm and collected, but Keiki's little sister actually loved talking to other girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there nothing else for you besides looking after Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I watch a lot of movies. Though rather than the cinema, I use the rental system."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that's nice. I also watch them quite often. The action ones with the macho men really get my fantasies pumping."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I don't watch movies with that in mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? You don't get fired up after seeing a battle scene, with sweat dripping from their bodies, with them being half-naked all the while?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really watch any movies with half-naked men." "Then… Fully naked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even less… Ah but, a while ago, I actually saw Nii-san completely naked." "You saw Kiryuu naked?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Yuika and Mao leaned forward out of shock when they heard about this unexpected development.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was thinking about this and that, so I decided to attack Nii-san while he was taking a bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, wait a second? Hold your horses. What kind of circumstances were there for this to happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. At the time, I was also naked." "Mizuha-senpai, you're way too bold…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika probably had imagined that scene. Since she was rather innocent in that regard, her cheeks turned a slight red.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that she mentions it, something like that did happen, yeah…</p>
<p class="null-p">After the training camp at the private residence, Mizuha had launched an attack while her older brother was taking a bath. Not to mention that only a towel was hiding her most important places.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After that, Nii-san fell over, and his towel fell to the ground. Thanks to that, I could see his most important place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to that lively confession, both Mao and Yuika gulped. "…You saw… Kiryuu's…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, head-on." "H-How was it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika is also interested." "Umm-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop stop stop?! No more than that, I beg you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, Keiki came storming into the living room. He had to stop any delicate information from being spread between the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">On the following day, Friday, time passed relatively quickly. Since it was the final day before the culture festival, there were no classes, and every single student was working on the final stages of the preparations. The members of the student council were no exception. Even the temporary member Keiki, who was walking through the school building with his partner Ayano next to him. Since he was also the manager of the maid cafe, he would try to make his way there to work as an assistant whenever he had the smallest amount of free time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-senpai, perfect timing. How does this look for the store's arrangement?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think a bit more space to walk through would be better. We won't be able to fit as many seats, but it's necessary or else it might get too crowded later when you want to bring out the food."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay okay, I understand!" "I'll help you out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started rearranging the chairs with Yuika. "We're back~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The members tasked with shopping for ingredients, including Chef Mizuha, came back with several plastic bags in hand. Shouma and Koharu were with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work, Mizuha. Shouma, Koharu, thanks, you two." "We have to help each other out at times like these."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I'll help out however I can."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma and Koharu offered to help so that the opening of the cafe would go flawlessly. In the meantime, Chef Mizuha started checking through various cooking utensils and setting everything up. Meanwhile, Mao was using a stepladder to decorate the room a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, the posters that Mao drew were already hanging all over the school. And although it was a lot of work for Yuika, she managed to get the two missing maid uniforms ready for tomorrow's opening. With the menu done as well, preparations were moving forward smoothly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, it's time to finish this!" "Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, after a long day of work, around the time when classes would normally end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… I'm really tired…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the otherwise empty student council office, Keiki was resting the upper half of his body on top of the table. The preparations for the maid cafe were complete, and every club member had already gone home. The same held true for the other student council members, but Keiki was so tired that he couldn't move a muscle, so he decided to take a break before mustering up the strength to make his way home. While he was busy groaning because of his sore muscles, the door to the student council office opened, and Shiho came in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? You're still here, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I was planning on taking a little break before going home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, today's been pretty busy, hasn't it? How about I make you some coffee to help with your fatigue?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, then I'll-" Keiki started getting up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't bother~ Let Onee-san do the work for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Throwing Keiki a wink, Shiho headed towards the kitchen area with the teapot. After she prepared two cups, the sweet aroma of coffee filled the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here you go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Keiki thanked her, Shiho sat down in front of him with a grin. They both took a sip of the coffee, and let out a relieved sigh at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that you managed the preparations for the store in time." "Yes, it's thanks to everyone's hard work that we've made it this far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really surprised when you suddenly told me you wanted to open up a shop."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I'm sorry about suddenly pushing that onto you. As well as taking off from work yesterday."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. You had your own set of circumstances."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki called her, he briefly explained the current problem they were facing. After all, he couldn't just ask for permission for the store without explanation. When he told her that Sayuki had been fired, and that they wouldn't be able to pay back the debt without the income from the store, the girl immediately gave her permission.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun's really had it hard recently. Being the manager of the maid cafe on top of being a temporary student council member."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right, ahaha. At this point, I'm thankful for any help I can get."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our job on the day of the culture festival is to only walk around and check on things anyway, so you might as well stay with the calligraphy club, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That won't do. Until we've paid the debt back, I'm still a member of the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun is so earnest. Onee-san thinks that's a wonderful trait to have."</p>
<p class="null-p">The upperclassman gave a giggle. And, with a somewhat lonely expression on her face, she ran her fingers around the rim of her teacup.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really envious of Tokihara-san, since she has a Kouhai like you." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you're working this hard for Tokihara-san, right? Even when you found out about her misuse of the budget, you still tried to cover for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since you know how important the calligraphy club is for her, you're trying your hardest to protect it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to protect an important place of someone who was precious to him. Those feelings were Keiki's only motivation at this moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Keiki-kun, do you like Tokihara-san?" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's thoughts came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no no no no. That's definitely not the case." "Ohh, what an energetic denial."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, Sayuki-senpai is beautiful, and she's very neat and clean when she keeps quiet, and her style and everything is totally within my strike zone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's this 'strike zone' about?" "But our interests don't match up." "Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, everyone has the wrong impression about Sayuki-senpai. She might look perfect from the outside, but she has a lot of holes, she's rather egoistic, and her jokes are sometimes at gradeschool level, and-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he couldn't say it, she was also a hardcore masochistic woman. "Anyway, that's how it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Keiki out, Shiho returned a grin. She looked like she was enjoying herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What's with that face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing at all? You just seem to look really closely at Tokihara-san." "Don't tease me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? What do you think about her, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, it's true that she's someone I can't leave alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Setting aside romantic feelings, the fact held true that Sayuki was an important person to Keiki. Even after she had done all these things to Keiki, he still treasured her to this degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd be nice if you could make up with Tokihara-san, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd really like to do that, but Sayuki-senpai didn't come to school today, either, and I can't get in touch with her… I'm thinking that she's probably still mad at me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It should be fine. Seeing how hard Keiki-kun is working right now will definitely make her happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, if you want to contact her, there's a nice method." "What method?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki showed interest in her words, Shiho threw him a wink. "You just have to visit her house."</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the school behind him, Keiki made his way towards the Tokihara residence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's as big as ever…"</p>
<p class="null-p">On this normal day in the latter half of October, the time was only a bit past 5pm, but the sky was already coloured an intense orange. In the middle of the residential area, her house sat. The Tokihara residence was an old-fashioned home which had withstood the tides of time. Though it only looked like it was a single-floor residence, it felt like it had quite the ancient origin, and it took Keiki a bit to get used to the difference.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Going to a girl's home like this really makes me feel tense…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that it was his upperclassman's home, right after they had a fight. But Keiki couldn't turn back right now. Taking a deep breath, he steeled his resolve and rang the doorbell. After waiting for a bit, with his heart pounding intensely, the door slowly opened with a rattle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, who might you be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who greeted him wasn't Sayuki, but another girl, who was a bit tinier than Sayuki, but with equally intense black hair. Her body was wrapped in a red kimono. Her black hair was bound together like a bun at the back of her head. Though her chest size couldn't even be compared to Sayuki's, they really looked alike.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it's her little sister? But Sayuki-senpai said that she's an only child…</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, might you be…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nice to meet you. I am Sayuki-senpai's Kouhai, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I thought so! So you are Kiryuu-kun. Sayuki-chan is always talking about you."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a refreshing and soothing voice, the woman clothed in traditional Japanese style gave a slight giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I don't mean to be rude, but are you possibly Sayuki-senpai's little sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No? I am Sayuki-chan's mother." "Mother?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Sayuki lookalike was Sayuki's mother. To be frank, she looked the same age as Sayuki herself, or even younger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You're very young, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufufu, I'm often told that I have a childlike face." "This isn't on the level of just childlike face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, thinking about how a legal loli like Koharu existed, her existence suddenly didn't seem all that irrational.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once again, I'm Sayuki-chan's mother, Tokihara Mifuyu. I've heard a lot about you from Sayuki-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lot?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. For example, how you recently spanked her." "Of all the things?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, you have a cute face, but you're quite the deviant inside." "It's a misunderstanding?!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">That incident had indeed happened. But that was only meant as punishment, or-for a masochist like her-motivation to work harder. It certainly wasn't like Keiki actually enjoyed doing that to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this girl telling her own mother…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki was more than intrigued to know what other embarrassing things the girl had said to her mother, that wasn't why he had come here today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, might Sayuki-senpai be at home right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did you come here because you were worried since she hasn't been to school for a while?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… That's right, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't exactly tell her that he was the reason for her absence from school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… But that's a bit problematic. Sayuki-chan has locked herself in her room and won't come out, you see. She even told me to send you away if you came to visit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How thorough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Keiki's possibilities were really limited. But he couldn't just turn around and give up now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, if that's so, then-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took a photo out of his bag and handed it to Mifuyu. "Could you give this to Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I'll give it to her."</p>
<p class="null-p">The mother smiled as she accepted. And said smile looked almost identical to Sayuki's normal one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her daughter's Kouhai off, Mifuyu went back inside, and headed to Sayuki's room, where Sayuki was already waiting for her with her head sticking out of the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Did Keiki-kun go home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're that interested, go see him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't wanna. We're still in the middle of our fight." "I wonder who you got that stubborn streak from." "From you. Who else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Mifuyu just returned a smile, all the while walking towards her, the photo in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, this is from Kiryuu-kun." "…? A photo?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, that was my job, so I'll be going now." "Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her mother off, her gaze fell to the photo in her hands. The photo was obviously taken by the professional Koharu, and it was probably printed with the high-tech printer in the astronomy club room. Inside the decorated calligraphy clubroom, the four members were standing next to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at the bottom, it said 'Welcome to our maid cafe!' "This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But with only this one photo, the girl immediately understood the boy's intentions. In order to stop the disbandment of the calligraphy club, they probably had decided to open up a shop at the culture festival to earn enough money to pay back the debt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, even after Sayuki had gotten fired, the boy was still working hard to save the calligraphy club she treasured so much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you said you preferred the student council…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he really thought that, then there would be no reason for him to do something like this. Understanding that, a tear of joy ran down her cheek. Trying to not let go of this feeling, she brought the picture to her chest, softly embracing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 5:</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, after the night ended, the fateful Saturday came. The morning had barely started, and the school was already as lively as ever. In the front yard, one could find many food stalls that were selling sausages, crepes and whatnot. The building itself was decorated to the hilt, with every class having some attraction of their own, and the gym hall was even equipped with a huge stage. In the midst of all of that, Keiki was walking around as a temporary member of the student council. Today and tomorrow, it wouldn't just be students walking around, but also various guardians and people from the nearby neighbourhoods. To prevent any trouble from stirring up with this mass of people, his mission was to walk around the place, and watch out for anything out of the ordinary that could spell danger. Even minor things like picking up lost belongings, helping a lost child, and so on could be rather time-consuming. After having helped reunite a father with his daughter, he had a thought while shaking the father's hand-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if the cafe is going okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't help but feel curious about how the store was doing. If he could, he'd go there immediately and help out, but his work as a student council member denied him from doing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just have to get through the morning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the morning was over, Keiki would be freed, and he could focus on</p>
<p class="null-p">supporting the maid cafe. While he thought that, the smartphone in his pocket vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, Kiryuu here."</p>
<p class="null-p">The person on the phone was someone from the executive committee. "…Yes, I understand. I will check it out immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">A customer had sent in a complaint about the exhibit being done by a first- year class. Really, the culture festival was nothing but trouble. In order to help out with this new problem immediately, Keiki made his way over there. And-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I came here because of a complaint," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that, this puts me in a bit of a bind," the person replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them were standing in front of a classroom. The person giving the grumpy response was another member of the student council, Nagase Airi, with her usual twintails as her one charming point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If the haunted house is too scary, you can just not enter it in the first place." "I agree with that, but still…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the complaint this time was something along the lines of 'The haunted house is too scary', which involved Airi's class' project. Of course, one could just avoid the haunted house, but that wasn't the matter at hand-</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Nagase-san, what are those clothes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Everyone from the class asked me to wear them, so I can't help it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Keiki's comment, Nagase-san gave a quick, embarrassed explanation. She had been tasked with the reception of the haunted house, and as a matter of fact, the clothes fit her perfectly. It was a black, one-piece costume, with horns on her head and bat wings emerging from her back. An</p>
<p class="null-p">imp cosplay.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"How do I say this? Considering Nagase-san's personality, it's a perfect fit." "Are you trying to pick a fight with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying it really suits you, though?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not happy at all to hear that a cosplay like this suits me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, since Airi's student council shift was in the afternoon, she was able to help out her class until lunch time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, setting that aside for now, the fact that we got a complaint is more important right now. That's why we have to test it no matter what-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki could finish his sentence, a terrified "Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa!" came from inside the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're going in? Apparently, the quality of the blood and the scares are so high that it can even make adults cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'll pass on that." "A wise decision."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wondered why they had to go this far for a high school culture festival. Instead, he decided to restrict the haunted house to people 15 years old or above, and make a sign indicating that the school would not be held responsible if anything should happen if that rule were disregarded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Kiryuu-senpai, is everything going along smoothly with the cafe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My turn to watch the festival is almost over, so I'm going to see for myself pretty soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go over there later to eat something, I guess." "Oh, you're coming over for a visit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course! I can't miss out on Yuika's maid uniform appearance!" "You're pretty honest with your desires…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man-hating Airi was actually a yuri novel author in secret. Although she was this cute, she was, yet again, a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll be off!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After giving his greetings to the Senpai who would take over his job, Keiki left the staff changing room behind him. Today, his job as a temporary student council member had ended, and now he had free time to act as the manager of the maid cafe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's see how the store is doing."</p>
<p class="null-p">The time was a bit after 2pm. A perfect time to eat at a food-and-drink store like a cafe. The cheerleading club also had a cafe set up in the special classrooms building, and Keiki gave it a sideways glance as he headed over to the calligraphy club's cafe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of the room, Keiki spotted an isolated blonde-haired girl, wearing a maid uniform. Without a doubt, she was the first-year member of the club…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?" "Ah, Keiki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she was called out, the girl ran over to him in a flustered manner. "There's a big problem!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Accidents always happen during times like these. With his experience from the student council, Keiki was confident that he could come up with a solution no matter what the problem was. But-</p>
<p class="null-p">"We aren't getting any customers at all!" "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem that Yuika voiced was outside of Keiki's expectations. On the first day of the cafe's opening, the management already was facing an unforeseen difficulty.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: It's the culture festival, everyone!</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, maid uniforms really are the best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right before the first day of the culture festival started, around 8:50 am. Manager Keiki showed a satisfied nod as he stood inside the calligraphy's cafe. In his view were three girls, all of them wearing cute maid uniforms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though this is the second time Yuika has worn something like this, she still can't get used to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is pretty embarrassing, isn't it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Nii-san's passionate gaze actually feels pretty good."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Yuika was nervously looking down at her appearance, Mao was trying to pull down her uniform's skirt, and the exibitionist Mizuha's cheeks were turning slightly red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'm glad that you managed to make them in time. Thanks a bunch, Yuika-chan. It must've been a lot of work, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Yuika had her own share of fun so it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika had been working on the uniforms at the Kiryuu household sleepover until late at night. She had managed to finish them in time, and with quite high quality, and was proof enough of her skill.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I never would have thought that Yuika had a talent for sewing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika's parents taught her how. Both of them work in the clothing business."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that's handy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's Yuika's dream to become a picture book author, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that your picture books are a bit too much for children to handle, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I actually like Yuika-chan's picture books." "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's face distorted after Mizuha dropped that bombshell.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, the girl's were a bit anxious about wearing maid uniforms, but now they were talking happily among each other. But there was a certain black- haired upperclassman missing from among them…</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, Sayuki-senpai never came, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki had hoped that the picture he sent her via her mother would bring her back to school, she was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, this doesn't change what I have to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to save the calligraphy club from getting disbanded, they had to earn enough money from this culture festival to repay her debt. That was Keiki's mission. For Sayuki, and for his comrades who had helped to even reach this starting point, he definitely had to make this maid cafe a success at all costs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, shouldn't you be going over to the student council now?" "Ah, yeah, it's already time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the clock, he had about 5 minutes left until his job would start. Said job was to walk around the festival and make sure that everything was going as planned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry about this. I'm the manager and I'm still leaving you all alone…" "It's okay. We'll watch over the store until you come back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. We even practiced customer service last night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll actually be able to focus better if the perverted manager isn't here with us."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha, Yuika, and Mao all gave (more or less) encouraging words. The survival of the calligraphy club now rested on their shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be back in the afternoon, so I'll leave this to you guys." "Have a safe trip!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sent off by these cute maids, the new manager left the room behind him. This had happened around three hours ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're kidding, right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he finished his job with the student council, what greeted Keiki when he arrived at the maid cafe was a completely empty cafe. It was a total failure. Not a single customer was there. The only people he found were the girls looking at each other in concern. The first person to speak up was Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okita-sensei, Shouma-kun, and the others came by to eat, but that's about it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only people who know us already…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way that they would be able to earn enough money if just a few friends came by.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe our location is bad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thinks so as well. This is the classroom building, so we're a bit far away from the action."</p>
<p class="null-p">If they had gotten a spot near the entrance, the customers would have without a doubt come flocking.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, the cheerleading club's cafe was near the student entrance. It was truly in an advantageous position, compared to the location of the calligraphy club's cafe. When it came to location, people would probably come here last, if at all. Since preparing for everything had taken a long time, they couldn't change location or anything like that in the heat of the moment. If they couldn't attract customers here, it would be all over. But the biggest problem of them all was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe Yuika's effort really was for nothing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like my posters weren't as good as I had thought…" "I guess I didn't work hard enough on the menu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The morale of all the club members had taken a nosedive.</p>
<p class="null-p">This isn't good… Everyone's motivation is going down the drain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within their limited timeframe that they had, the girls had worked their hardest to finish their preparations in time. You couldn't blame them for getting discouraged when they were faced with this situation. But the morale of the waitresses directly affects the efficiency of the store.</p>
<p class="null-p">As their manager, I have to give them a little pep talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking care of the idols' mental health was also a very important job of a manager.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's difficult but I have to do this!</p>
<p class="null-p">With no confidence that he could do it, Keiki turned to look at the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, listen up. It's not your fault that the customers aren't coming in. It's because I took this too lightly. I should've realized that our position is more than unfavorable."</p>
<p class="null-p">The people who had worked hard to decorate the interior and to come up with a good menu weren't to blame here. The blame lay with Keiki, who had opened the store without thinking about the problematic location, and had left everything in the girl's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, as your manager, I'll definitely work something out. After all, I have three cute maids here to support me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Any girl would be happy to be called cute. When they heard these magical words, the girls immediately reacted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan is a flawless beauty, after all," Keiki added. "W-Well, of course," Yuika replied</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou has a nice style, and your tsundere act really hits close to home," he said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't call me tsundere…" Mao replied with a bashful look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, your teasing is a bit overboard at times, but I can't say that I don't appreciate your openness," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really… Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Keiki was doing a good job encouraging them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that being said, the culture festival has just started, so I'm sure that if we just go full throttle, everything will work out. No doubt it's a handicap, but let's focus on how we can get past that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. We still have time." "Yes, it'll be fine if it's us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it feels a bit weird hearing this from Keiki's mouth, I guess I can help out."</p>
<p class="null-p">As planned, smiles returned to the girls' faces. And suddenly, a customer finally arrived. "-Excuse me~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, welcome back!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika turned around to face the customer with a smile, "…Eh, it's just Airi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the person standing there, Yuika let out a sigh. Facing her was the now uniform-wearing Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that reaction? I came here as a customer, after all." "Ayano-san also came to visit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano peeked her head out from behind Airi's back. With one eye still hidden by her bangs, the student council vice president Ayano Fujimoto</p>
<p class="null-p">waved gently at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Fujimoto-san came as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I wanted to cheer for you, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for that. Yuika-chan, can you do the service?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Yuika will show your her everything. Business smile, business smile… Tehe~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, even though it's totally fake, that's even better! And this maid uniform is super cute!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The yuri author Nagase Airi went crazy after seeing Yuika's business smile. "Hey, Yuika? Can I take a picture?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, pictures with the maids aren't allowed~" "No way?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, my ladies, here is your seat, if you would."</p>
<p class="null-p">The blonde-haired maid guided Airi and Ayano to their seats. While they looked at the menu, Yuika brought them something to drink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you all ready to order?" "Umm… Yes, I'll take the omurice." "Ayano-san will have the same."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood! Mizuha-senpai, two omurice please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Coming right up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the order came in, Mizuha started cooking immediately. In the meantime, the other girls and Keiki could only watch her, bewitched. Just</p>
<p class="null-p">that alone had made the maid uniforms worth it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm, a cooking maid is the best. Or is it Mizuha-senpai's charm? Not to mention that Nanjou-senpai is just as cute. If the law allowed it, I'd do anything to cop a feel of their butts," Airi muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you even saying with that serious face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The difference between his Kohai's inside and outside was as tremendous as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to make sure that nobody else heard him, Keiki slowly moved closer to Airi and whispered to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you not look at my store's maids with such lustful eyes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do. It's duty to burn Yuika's maid appearance into my retinas right here and right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Saying that without restraint is a skill in and of itself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that her eyes were so serious that even Keiki was almost intimidated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, you've become close enough with her to call her by her given name…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's thanks to Kiryuu-senpai. Recently, we've even been speaking with each other in the classroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before, when Airi had told Yuika "I want to be friends with Koga-san," she had been shot down immediately, and she had asked Keiki for help. Even when Yuika's plan to make Keiki her slave had been discovered by Airi, that only caught her attention even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the meantime, however, Yuika brought over the finished food. "Thank you for waiting~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, this doesn't look like food from a maid cafe at all." "It looks delicious…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Ayano's and Airi's eyes started sparkling when Yuika put the food down on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">A golden egg on top of a paper plate. Inside was a healthy amount of chicken. There was even a heart symbol made out of ketchup that the maids had added.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, one for Nii-san as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha suddenly appeared next to Keiki and handed him an omurice on top of a paper plate. It seemed like she made her older brother one also while she was at it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't eat anything for lunch yet, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, but we have to think of what to do next before anything else…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're stomach's empty, you won't be able to come up with anything good, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's also true… I'm digging in, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha made Keiki sit down with Ayano and Airi, and he didn't wait long before putting a spoonful of omurice into his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, how is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm, it's super delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So he says. Good for you, Mao-chan." "Eh? Nanjou made this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki looked over at Mao in surprise, and found her nodding in a flustered manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I promised you before that I would make some omurice for you…" "Ahh, yeah you did say something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was back when the two of them had gone on a date during summer break to gather data for Mao. She had said that when they were taking a small break in a family restaurant. It seems like Mao was the one who had thought that he should be coming soon, and had started preparing omurice for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. It really is delicious." "…I see. I'm glad, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she answered nonchalantly, Keiki still saw her mouth form a slight smile as she turned around. A nice tsundere act that ended up being a good side dish during his lunch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after, Keiki finished up the rest of his food, and Airi and Ayano followed soon after, also putting down their spoons, clearly satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the food. It was very delicious.." "Yeah, it was tremendously good."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming to have enjoyed Mizuha's omurice, the girls had wide smiles on their faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it seems like you're still lacking customers." "Nagase-san still doesn't know how to hold back, I see…" "Are you going to be able to pay back the club budget?" "Uuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like I'm hung up on disbanding the calligraphy club anymore, you know? But we still can't let this go unseen without any consequences."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">In that regard, only the calligraphy club was to blame. To be fair, the student council's decision was rather soft, considering the circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi, don't you have any good ideas?" "Hmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuika walked over to ask her about it, Airi started thinking deeply, gathering the gazes of every member present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about changing the maid cafe… into a swimsuit cafe?" "Rejected. Airi, are you an idiot or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That accusation seemed to be quite shocking to Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The maid uniforms really are cute, but maybe the boys are just too embarrassed to enter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that might be a thing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Any boy would want to see an erotic maid up close. However, he wouldn't want to look like he only came here because of the erotic uniform. It was quite the dilemma for an adolescent boy indeed. Probably comparable to buying a porn magazine when the cashier is a woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it, the cafe of the cheerleading club is holding back with their uniforms…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And Airi wasn't quite done yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you even advertise this properly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We did hang out some posters and so forth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not nearly enough. First thing should be to let everyone know that they can find a maid cafe here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-And how she would go about doing that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have the perfect opportunity right here with these maid uniforms." "Meaning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Make the girls hand out flyers while wearing the maid uniforms?" "Flyers…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A completely different method of advertising besides hanging out posters. Personally receiving a flyer from a cute maid might motivate some customers to come over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But we can't just leave the store unattended… Two people would have to stay behind to cook and take orders."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following the manager's words, a fierce battle of rock-paper-scissors ensued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The calligraphy maid cafe is waiting for your arrival on the first floor of the special classroom building! Please come see it if you have the time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Beneath the clear autumn sky, in front of the student entrance, Yuika was currently working her hardest to give out as many flyers to male students as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… If only Yuika had used rock in that last round, she would've won…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's rock-paper-scissors for you. You'll never know what you should pick until it's over."</p>
<p class="null-p">The fierce battle ended with Yuika as the loser. Using the PC's in a nearby IT room, they had printed out flyers, and now Yuika was handing them out with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But thanks to Yuika-chan, we're distributing a lot of flyers. Those maid</p>
<p class="null-p">uniforms really work wonders."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like Yuika likes being stared at, though." "That just shows how cute you are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If she's that cute, will you become her slave?" "That's a no from me, captain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Shit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you just say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, Yuika doesn't care about Keiki-senpai anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Acting like her mood had been spoiled by Keiki, Yuika averted her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The shop interior is one thing, but walking around outside with these maid clothes is pretty embarrassing, you know? This job is more fit for the hardcore masochistic Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm sure that Sayuki-senpai would have gladly taken this job." "…Really, it just feels weird not having her around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, Yuika would always be engaged in fierce battle against her arch- nemesis Sayuki, but she seemed to miss her a bit as well. However, they were in the middle of work, and couldn't dwell in memories. Their first priority was to attract new potential customers-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello! We're doing a maid cafe, so if you have the time, please come visit- Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika had been about to hand over a flyer to the next person, but upon seeing their appearance, her hand immediately came to a halt.</p>
<p class="null-p">A big round head, with equally round ears. Their body was covered by a thick, brown hide-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…A bear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Exactly. Someone in a big bear costume was standing in front of them. Though it wasn't exactly weird to see someone cosplay, a big bear costume certainly was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the two couldn't hide their surprise. The bear, however, turned towards Yuika and held out one of its paws.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? You want… A flyer?" "………Nod"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Here you go…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Accepting the flyer, the bear bowed to Yuika and went on its way again. "…What was that about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I don't have any idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, all they could do was ponder about it for a bit, and resume their work of handing out flyers.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they had finished handing out the flyers, their customer traffic grew a bit more in number.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this still isn't exactly the situation we were hoping for…" They still only had a handful of customers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even now, Yuika can man the floor alone." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The store currently was empty enough that Mao could even slack off if she</p>
<p class="null-p">wanted to. Keiki had been planning on buying new ingredients once the food ran out, but sadly, he didn't have to worry about that right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess we'll have to hand out flyers one more time?" "I'd recommend trying it in front of the gym hall." "Yeah, that makes sense-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When a voice that didn't belong to Mao answered him, Keiki turned around, and was greeted by-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai? And Rinko, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heyho! We're taking a break right now, so we thought that we would get some delicious belated dinner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello there!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The student council president Takasaki Shiho, with her hair as long and wavy as ever. And the student council's secretary Mitani Rin, the boy who acted like a girl who had a short haircut.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them seemed to be coming to visit as normal customers. "…I guess the student council really doesn't have any boys…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was standing next to them, grumbling something to herself. It seemed like she had no idea that Rin was actually a boy. Of course, seeing through it would be pretty impossible with his girly looks, but he was indeed a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing a girl's uniform was nothing more than a hobby for him. During the times he was in his girl persona, Keiki called him 'Rinko', and 'Rintarou' if it not.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll keep quiet about Mitani being a boy for now. If Mao finds out, he'll definitely be turned into doujin material…</p>
<p class="null-p">A beautiful boy like him, who you could even mistake for a girl, would probably be perfect material for the fujoshi. A while ago, she had been</p>
<p class="null-p">talking about adding another male character, and Rin really might end up as a model for the 'Shortcake Series'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'll lead you to your seats. Nanjou, can you get them something to drink?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sending Mao away, the manager guided the two of them to an open table. The two of them ended up also ordering an omurice from menu. While they were waiting for the food, their gazes wandered over to the three maids walking around in the store.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was serving customers with a smile. Mizuha was clearly enjoying herself as she made the omurice portions. Mao was measuring out some coffee. Being able to watch the maids work like this is precisely what makes a maid cafe shine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The maid uniforms all look so cute. I'd love to try one on, as well." "I did wear one back at a middle school culture festival."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure you didn't complain back then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Rin-chan, who do you like the most out of the three of them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… They're all cute, sure, but I'd probably take the cooking maid. She's got a good pair of breasts, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't look at my little sister like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he looked like a girl, Rin had a boy's heart, and loved breasts as much as everybody else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Keiki-kun. I heard from Airi that the management of your cafe isn't going as well as you'd like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a shame, yes. I'd like to get more customers in, but I can't think of much to do about it. Do you have any ideas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho put one hand on her cheek as she looked around the store. "Most of the people that come here are boys, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a maid cafe, after all. The menu is also made with boys in mind." "Then how about trying to get more female customers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Female customers, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that Keiki and the others were hoping to gather boys with this cafe. But around half of the students at the school were still girls, so you couldn't deny their existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was over at the cheerleading club's cafe, and they had a lot of female customers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They prepared a lot of delicious sweets, after all." "Sweets, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Girls did seem to really love their sweets.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, the cheerleading club really is amazing…</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like their marketing skills far surpassed those of amateurs. They had good costumes as well as a well-balanced menu, which clearly earned them the amount of customers they had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we try adding some sweets to the menu as well, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Making sweets just like that seems pretty difficult to me. Leaving everything to Mizuha would cost us a lot of time, as well as being a huge burden for her, so if there was something quick and easy to make…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, then I might have a good idea for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something easy to make! How about pancakes? I really love them, so I make them at home!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pancakes… That might be a good idea, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">A very delicious sweet, and easy to make. They don't require any weird spices or anything, and it's something that people could buy while just passing through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…All right! I'm going out for a bit to buy the ingredients!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, they tried making some pancakes. They mixed up some pancake powder with eggs and milk to create the dough and poured three small pancakes onto the griddle. After taking them off and putting them on plastic plates, they garnished them with whatever they wanted, like honey, cream, chocolate, and such-</p>
<p class="null-p">"The mini pancakes are done!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. This is really easy to make."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're pretty simple to make and still very delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They even look a bit cute, so I'm sure that the guys will like them." Yuika, Mao, and Mizuha all gave their impressions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nice that we can put so many different things on them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I think that the girls would be pretty happy about this menu." After finished off their omurice, Rin and Shiho also gave their approval. "Alright, then let's add this to the menu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They wrote 'Mini Pancakes' on the menu and even added a small sticker that read 'We have pancakes now!' to draw attention to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not long after that, their advertisement started bearing fruit. Aside from the occasional male customer, a large number of female customers started arriving. Around noon, the amount of girls grew much greater in number.</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with the omurice, the small, cute, and easy to eat pancakes quickly grabbed the hearts of the girls, and it turned into quite the popular product.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amazing, Keiki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like Nii-san's plan worked out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The ones who came up with the idea were Takasaki-senpai and Mitani, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the two girls from the student council, they had managed to attract a lot of female customers. Though they couldn't relax just yet, it was definitely a significant improvement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm, Keiki-senpai?" "Mmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone tugged on his sleeve, and Keiki glanced over there to see Yuika pointing at the entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Isn't that the person from before…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The customer who had just stepped into the store was the bear they had met before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome back… Master… Mistress… Ehhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Mao wasn't sure how to greet the customer. "…Bear-sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, she decided on that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'll be guiding you to your seat, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow managing to force out a smile, the brownish red-haired maid took the bear to an open table, and the bear sat down. He then started looking at the menu in his hands. The sight was so unreasonably absurd that even the other guests around him couldn't help but stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it seems like Bear-sama is ready to order." "I wonder what he's going to order?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's gotta take the pancakes with honey, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and the others were watching the bear in anticipation, but what he pointed at on the menu was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, the omurice. I see. Please wait a moment." "Why the omurice…?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_15.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The bear completely ignored everyone's imaginations. As Mao returned back to the group, she let out an exasperated sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, what's wrong with this bear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We saw him earlier when we were handing out flyers, too." "Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever the circumstances, Mizuha hurriedly started working on the omurice the bear had ordered, and once that was finished, Mao walked over to him with the order in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…How is the bear even going to eat that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, someone wearing the costume would have to take off the head part, but the bear didn't show any intention of doing so. Instead, he just stared blankly at the food in front of him. After a brief moment of silence, the bear suddenly put his hands on the head part, lifting it up barely enough to fit the spoon in there, and started eating the omurice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you serious…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At least take it off while you're eating…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe he just doesn't want to destroy the dreams of children…" "It looks more like he's trying to do that, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And while the workers conversed about this, the bear was happily eating his</p>
<p class="null-p">meal. After that nightmare-like scene, the bear paid for the meal and left the store as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that about, really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A bear had requested a flyer and eaten an omurice. It was the weirdest thing Keiki had seen all day. The Bear-sama's mysteries were deep indeed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time was close to 3pm in the afternoon. Having become the one</p>
<p class="null-p">responsible for the pancakes, Manager Kiryuu was now heading to a nearby toilet, and he coincidentally met up with a former customer from before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? It's Keikun-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rinko? …No, you're Rintarou now."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been wearing a girl's uniform and skirt earlier, but now he was clothed in a normal boy's uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I thought. It really feels weird to see you wearing pants like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't go into the toilet here while wearing a skirt, so I have to change first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I can already imagine the rukus you'd cause."</p>
<p class="null-p">While they chatted, Keiki also finished his business, and lined up next to Rin to wash his hands as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Rintarou, do you have any more patrolling shifts today?" "Nope. Now I'm helping my class with their own stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Nagase-san was also helping with that. She was the receptionist wearing that cute cosplay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san was wearing cosplay? I would've loved to see that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rin said this with a sad expression, and they were about to leave the toilet when…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They laid eyes on a small living creature that was sitting on the hallway floor. "A frog…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A bright green frog was sitting next to an open window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, it must've come in through the window. But leaving it here like this would be bad, so I guess we'll help it get out again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" "Rintarou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he glanced over at his strangely quiet Kouhai, he found him completely frozen in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You look a bit pale. Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm not okay… I'm really bad with frogs… and any slippery living beings in general!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really just like a girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did it just move?! …S-Save… Save me!" "W-Woah, Rintarou?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The frog slightly moved, and the terrified Kouhai suddenly clung to Keiki. Haah… If only he was a girl, I would actually be happy about this… However, he was a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being hugged by someone of the same gender like this didn't make Keiki happy at all. And while this was happening, the frog started moving towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hya?! W-Why's he suddenly coming over here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With absolutely no ill intent whatsoever, the frog just happened to climb onto Rin's shoe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? No way?! Is he-"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, he was already inside Rin's pants.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noooooooooooooo?! Ahhhh, this slippery, wet feeling is so disgusting!!! Take it out! Take it out please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Rintarou?! Calm down for a second!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of listening to Keiki, Rin frantically started taking off his pants- "Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The pants legs got hung up near his knees, and he fell face-first to the floor. He was on all fours now, and his butt, only covered by his boxers, was in plain view. It was quite the sexy sight. But since the person in question was still a boy, Keiki couldn't enjoy this sight at all, and just walked towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, come on, I'll take it off you, so don't move!" "P-Please…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he had promised, Keiki carefully picked up the frog and put it down on the floor again. In response, it just hopped off somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look, it's gone. Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes… Thank you very much…" Rin said, his breathing rough, and tears forming in his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Keiki heard something fall down behind him. Turning around, he spotted the maid-uniform-clad Nanjou Mao, who had just dropped her container of milk on the floor. Her shoulders were shaking violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Kiryuu… W-What are you doing…?!" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki was confused by Mao's weird behaviour, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki realized what she was staring at, the alarm cells in his brain started blaring.</p>
<p class="null-p">A beautiful looking boy, with his pants pulled down, sweating furiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Behind his back, another boy with a relieved expression. There's only one conclusion that a fujoshi like Mao could arrive at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that Kiryuu is drilling his way into a beautiful boy like this?!" "I'm not drilling into anything!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, what came out of her mouth was the worst possible misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What if I poured some of my milk onto you…?" "Stop?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki let out a desperate scream to stop the fujoshi, who had just picked up</p>
<p class="null-p">her milk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou! Her ability to reason is getting dangerously low, so hurry up and put on your pants."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes… What was that about her ability to reason?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rin hurriedly pulled his pants on with a confused expression on his face. "And why are you even here, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we ran out of milk, so I went to get some…" "What kind of bad timing is that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since their classroom that they were using for the store didn't have a refrigerator, they had to borrow the cooking classroom's to store everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, aren't you the girl from the student council from before?! Did you suddenly turn into a boy?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I've been a boy from the very start."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nani?! To think that I would mistake a boy for a girl…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, it would've been better for her to have that misunderstanding forever. But, of course, Mao wouldn't listen to that request anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, whatever. Who were you again? Mitani or something?" "Ah, yes. I'm Mitani Rin…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mitani, how close are you to Kiryuu?" "Well, he saw me naked once." "Naked?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And he even touched my crotch." "Crotch?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's not like I touched it of my own accord…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To show Keiki that he was indeed a man, Rin had taken his hand on the day of the pool cleaning and pushed it against his own crotch. It was the worst possible experience for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu fu fu… Here it is! Here it is!!! I've decided to make you the new character!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a rotten laugh, the pervert pointed at Rintarou. The fujoshi must've been in high spirits after finding a new model for her BL manga and doujinshi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… New character… for what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just ignore her. She can be a bit weird in the head from time to time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just imagining Rin participating in all this BL doujinshi stuff made Keiki's head ache. Not to mention that he already had to worry about the cafe right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">Around 4pm in the afternoon, the first day of the culture festival came to an end. Now that cleaning was next on their agenda, the members changed and all went to clean their respective areas of the room. Keiki for his part was currently using a calculator to check how much money they had made that day, offsetting the costs for the food and ingredients.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san. I've finished cleaning the kitchen area." "Same here. The floor's done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, an easy victory for Yuika." "Ohh, good work everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to everyone's efforts, the cleaning was done fairly quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You all must be tired from your long work day, right? You all can go home now and rest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like it'll take a bit longer here." "Really? I'll go home and make dinner, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Entering the self-made staffroom, the girls took their bags, and left. "Then Yuika will be going now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"See you tomorrow~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san. Don't push yourself too hard, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. You all just go home without making any detours, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After sending the girls off, Keiki's gaze returned back to the situation shown on the desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His 'It'll take a bit longer' just now was actually a lie. His work was already done. The reason why he couldn't tell them was because the number shown on the memo was far too heartbreaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not good at all. To think that we still can't repay the debt…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they had just barely managed to get out of the red, they were far from the desired amount. This was what had resulted from handing out flyers and making sweets, and it had greatly helped their income. However, that was only barely enough for them to avoid ending up in the red. The overall situation was still as disastrous as before. Not to mention the costs for the costumes and the dough for the pancakes…</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it goes like this again tomorrow, it'll all be over…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To put it simply, they wouldn't be able to earn enough money if they didn't get at least twice the amount of customers they had today. And Keiki was painfully aware of that, since he had gone over it multiple times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If only I came up with a better plan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this tight schedule, the girls were working hard for the cafe, even though all the while they were sleep-deprived. Even today, they had been working almost the whole time without taking a single break. Keiki felt responsible for the fact that even with all this, they still hadn't made enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't there… Some better method…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Something he could change before the store opened tomorrow. A plan that would attract even more people than today. If he didn't manage to do that, the</p>
<p class="null-p">calligraphy club would be disbanded for sure. "Disbanded…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He pictured the scene of Tokihara Sayuki, crying. If she lost the club, she would cry once again. Just like that one night-</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, tears started building up in his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was frustrated by his own incompetence, frustrated by his own weakness, and frustrated because, at this rate, all the hard efforts of his comrades would all be for nothing-</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… Should I do now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Resting himself on the table to hide his face, he just sighed. And suddenly, in his depressed mood, a handkerchief suddenly appeared on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe one of the club members hadn't gone home yet?</p>
<p class="null-p">When he lifted his head, he was greeted by the bear costume blankly staring at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki jumped up from the chair out of shock. Probably scared by that, the bear hurriedly ran out of the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Bear-sama…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lost by the current situation, Keiki instead gazed at the handkerchief on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Did he come here to cheer me up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But he didn't understand why a person wearing a bear costume would do that. Just happening to spot Keiki as he trotted through the school building sounded too coincidental. Thinking about it, that bear had been weird from the very beginning. He didn't speak a single thing when he asked for Yuika's flyer, and he had finished eating the omurice without taking off his head. As if the person inside wanted to hide their identity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way-"</p>
<p class="null-p">When a certain possibility ran through Keiki's mind, he dashed out of the room. A little ways down the hall, he spotted his target.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second!" "……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of listening to Keiki's request, the bear instead started running away. However, since Keiki wasn't wearing a costume like the bear, the bear was too slow as it ran away. As a result, he couldn't escape Keiki, and was pushed into the corner of the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're as athletic as ever-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki said, as he put both his arms on the bear's head. "-Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So you found me out."</p>
<p class="null-p">The person hiding inside the bear costume was none other Tokihara Sayuki. As if she felt awkward because of this sudden reveal, she averted her gaze as she pouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you even wearing a bear costume?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I mean, meeting you face-to-face would've been way too embarrassing." "What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You brought over a photo yesterday, right?" "Ah yes. I see you brought it here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I became interested in this maid cafe you were doing, but I felt awkward showing my face since we're still in the middle of our fight, so I decided to wear this bear costume while checking things out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't make any sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki understood what she wanted to say. Though he didn't understand why she'd wear a bear costume.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did you even get that from in the first place?" "It was just laying around in the school's storage shed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'd like to have a calm conversation, so can we go back to the classroom for now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking the head of the costume in one hand, Keiki grasped the girls hand. After they returned to the classroom, Keiki put the head down on a nearby table. Next to him was Sayuki, slowly working on taking off the rest of the costume.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you were wearing a normal uniform inside."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Were you expecting me to be naked inside? Fufu, sorry about that." "Nobody was expecting anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After teasing her Kouhai like she always would, the Senpai fell silent, and there was an awkward silence. Even though they wanted to properly have a</p>
<p class="null-p">talk with each other, once they had the other in front of them, they couldn't find the right words.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, the two of them were still in the middle of a fight. And not to mention that they had said quite the harsh words to each other before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I was always watching." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How Keiki-kun and Koga-san were handing out flyers, how you started making pancakes to attract more customers… I saw how hard you were working through the window."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you were watching us…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was lucky that she hadn't been seen, otherwise she would've been reported as an intruder.</p>
<p class="null-p">I started to feel so embarrassed when I was holed up at home. Even though everyone was working so hard for the calligraphy club, what was I doing? I was thinking things like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai isn't at fault. The person at fault was me for saying all those horrible things to you. I ended up hurting you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You mean the 'Virgin-senpai' comment? Don't worry, I didn't mind it that much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not that. I meant that I said I preferred the student council over the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's my fault. Even though Keiki-kun was worried about me, I called him 'Virgin-kun.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I can't say that that didn't hurt…" "Ah, I thought so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's true that I made you cry. -I'm sorry." "Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki always regretted making Sayuki cry. But returning to the past to fix his mistakes was impossible. That was why, in order to not regret anything again, he decided to immediately apologize as soon as they saw each other again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You see, there's something that I couldn't tell you." "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, Keiki-kun seemed to be having a good time, right? You've been doing good work at the student council, and you've become close with Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's true, I guess."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_16.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san told me. At this rate, even if we pay back the debt, Keiki-kun might still not come back to the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Yuika-chan said something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the girls came up with some plan to take you back by force." "Ahhh, they were talking about some weird plan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">During the sleepover, the girls had been talking something that sounded like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But wait, Sayuki-senpai didn't do anything, right?" "Yes, I didn't participate in that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun ended up in the student council because of my mistake in the first place. I can't be so selfish as to ask him to come back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And is this what you weren't able to tell me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's right. I wanted you to come back, but that was the one thing that I just couldn't tell you directly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki lowered her head, dejected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But when you told me that you preferred the student council… I thought… that I wanted to have Keiki-kun at my side. I can't think of a calligraphy club without you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki gave Keiki a beautiful smile, and he could feel his face burning up. "Keiki-kun? What do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it was an unfair question.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl liked to tease her Kouhai. And Keiki liked this teasing side of her. Not to mention that Keiki was working this hard to protect the calligraphy club in the first place, so the answer was obvious at this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to stay in the calligraphy club. The club where Sayuki-senpai is."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard that, Sayuki couldn't hold back her smile. Even though they were in agreement from the very start, they had gotten into a fight because of something small, and now they had finally managed to make up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But our current sales are rather depressing. At this rate, the calligraphy club will…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that should be no problem." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just leave the cafe to me. I have the perfect solution." "You do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like I was just playing around all day while wearing that bear costume. I was studying what popular things the other classes were selling."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A bear investigation…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And after combing through all the different ideas I came across, I finally know how to save the store."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this magical method?!" "Do you want to know?" "Naturally!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki nodded in satisfaction when she heard Keiki's exclamation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically… Become an influencer!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With complete confidence, the girl said something rather cheap.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: It's the culture festival, you perverts!</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the second day of the culture festival. Inside the gym hall, a big event had been attracting guests since early in the morning. The name of the event was 'Momo High Costume Contest'.</p>
<p class="null-p">The students would dress up in whatever disguise or costume they preferred, make a performance, and compete for the highest score. Several cameras were set up inside the hall to let everybody see the performers. These cameras were connected to huge screens set up above the stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, a boy with a tall stature was standing on top of the stage. He was wearing what seemed to be an ape costume, and he was juggling skillfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">As an aside, the person commentating this event was the crossdressing Mitani Rin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh?! Now this is a sight to behold! Just what you would expect from the young ace of the volleyball club! Wonderful juggling, which is all thanks to his high agility!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy wearing girl's clothing was holding a mic in his hands, happily commentating. Keiki and Ayano were sitting in the audience, gazing up at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that Rinko would be the commentator of this event…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Having a cute girl commentate the costume contest is always a better way to attract people, or so the committee representative said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rinko isn't even a girl, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Do the people from the committee not know that Rin is a boy? "Still, this is a crazy number of people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This event sure is popular."</p>
<p class="null-p">This costume contest was always a big occasion, so they had to gather every free chair in the school building they could get. Even so, many students still had to stand in the back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before the event started, Keiki happened to meet up with Ayano, so they decided that they might as well watch it together. Lucky for them, they had found two seats next to each other that were still open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, let's ask our jury for their score!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The jury consisted of a girl with her hair in braids, a burly jock, and a nerdy- looking male student with glasses. All three were members of the festival committee, and the student with glasses was the president of said committee. They each could give a score between 0 and 10, so there was a maximum score of 30.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_17.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Very well done~ The fact that you're an ikemen gives you extra points~" "Though your overall muscle level was lacking, it was fun to watch." "Hmm… Very eccentric."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like the jury really enjoyed the performance from the boy in the ape costume.</p>
<p class="null-p">"9 Points! 8 Points! 9 Points! Altogether, you get 26 points! The highest score so far!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Out of 30 possible points, the performer got a whopping 26 points. After hearing the announcement from the jury, the boy did a victory pose. He left the stage while waving to the audience.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Sayuki-senpai going to be okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday, around the time when classes normally would end, the girl said that she would be participating in this contest. This was the reason why Keiki had left Yuika in charge of the maid cafe and had come to the gym hall like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">According to Sayuki, her intention behind doing so was to 'Become an influencer'. That morning, she had a confident smile as she told Keiki "Leave it to me!", but that only made Keiki feel more anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it's a shame, our next act will be the last!" said Rin, which brought forth cries of surprise from the audience.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to see more!" "Mitani-chan, marry me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">…One moment of silence for our fallen brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">You shouldn't be led astray by his cute looks. After all, he had a d*ick</p>
<p class="null-p">attached to his crotch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu fu fu, since the last contestant is a beautiful Onee-san, I'm sure that all of you guys will enjoy it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The male audience roared in expectation after that comment from Rinko.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then without further ado, let's welcome her to the stage! It's the club president of the calligraphy club: Tokihara Sayuki-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, the girl who they had been waiting for entered the stage. She was wearing a black & white maid uniform and her hair was in twintails. The appearance of this big-breasted beauty threw the audience into complete chaos. When she reached the middle of the stage, one of the event helpers brought a table and put it down in front of her. Yet another student prepared a paper plate with an omurice on the table. This omurice was specifically created for this event by Mizuha. But unlike the ones from their store, this one didn't have a heart on it yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly is she planning on doing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not knowing what was going to happen from now on, Keiki and the audience could only watch in suspense as she took out something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ketchup?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was something you would find in any normal household, a normal bottle of ketchup.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today, I want everyone to see my wonderful performance."</p>
<p class="null-p">While she said that, she opened up the lid of the bottle and slowly started pouring ketchup onto the omurice. No, she wasn't just pouring it onto it. It looked like she was writing something. It was so soft, yet complex, something that you wouldn't expect to be done with just ketchup-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Heh, she's probably writing something useless again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone in the audience muttered, when Sayuki put down the bottle. When</p>
<p class="null-p">the camera moved over the omurice, the ketchup written on it said 'Through and through'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah! How did she even write that?!" "I was too far away and couldn't see it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How can you even write such a complicated kanji with ketchup?!" The whole place went wild after this sudden reveal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tokihara-senpai is amazing…" "This is just utter nonsense…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Ayano seemed was blown away like everyone else present, Keiki couldn't believe that they were going crazy over something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though you're far from an ikemen, it really was a great show I have to say~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was missing some muscles here and there, but you did great work just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to agree. Wonderful ketchup handling."</p>
<p class="null-p">What the hell is ketchup handling?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when the committee president threw in a weird neologism, Rin also cut in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, how about we see the scores for this magnificent act from our jury!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Rin's inquiry, the three judges wrote their respective scores on their boards. And thus, the results were publicized.</p>
<p class="null-p">"10 points! 10 points! 10 points! A combined score of 30 points! I-I can't believe it?! Today's first perfect score!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Rin announced it, the whole place went rampant again. "Seriously…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Complete victory…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The last participant of an event suddenly appearing and having such an overwhelming victory was too much like a manga development.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's move on to today's costume contest award ceremony!" "Before that, could I have a short bit of everyone's time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Ah, yes, here you go." "Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki received the mic from Rin and stepped forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, thank you for attention just now. About this omurice here, it was actually made by the maid cafe on the first floor in the special classroom building, so if you have time, be sure to come by!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After advertising the store, the black-haired maid gave a gleeful smile. Of course, as a result, the whole place was enveloped in roars even louder than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around one hour after that amazing stage performance. Keiki and Ayano were looking at yet another amazing occurrence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is… amazing…" "Yeah… I can't believe it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they looked around the maid cafe, every single seat was currently</p>
<p class="null-p">occupied. It made sense, though, considering the scale of the previous event. After Sayuki's performance, the information about the calligraphy club's omurice spread throughout the school like wildfire. Especially since you could have a maid write whatever you wanted on top of yours.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a result of that wildfire, students arrived at the cafe in greater and greater numbers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-senpai, another omurice!" "Y-Yeees!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, we need another omurice over here as well!" "Wahhhh?! U-Understood!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was even a line building up outside. "Yuika has brought your order!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd like to pay? Thank you very much for your visit." Yuika and Mao were also busy serving the customers-</p>
<p class="null-p">"The word you've ordered is 'Congenial' right? Understood! Then, I'll be writing it with all my heart!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the omurice was finished, it was Sayuki's job to write the desired word on it. Of course, directly in front of the customers' eyes. Many of their customers came here just to take a picture of the beautiful ketchup calligraphy. This is probably what the girl meant by 'Becoming an influencer'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that we bought enough ingredients like Sayuki-senpai advised us to."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki was a bit anxious that they might go even further in the red if her plan backfired, things were looking good for now. Indeed, they still might not have enough ingredients.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Tokihara-senpai really is amazing," Ayano muttered from next to Keiki while standing in the deeper part of the shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That omurice is so calligraphy-club-like. It fits perfectly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though writing on an omurice with ketchup wasn't anything rare, writing calligraphy-inspired words and letters was something original to this maid cafe alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, isn't it going to be time for your student council job soon?" "I feel bad for leaving the store like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't help it. Keiki-kun has his own work to do." "Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave the maid cafe to me. I'll make up for all the time that I was slacking off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright then. I guess I'll just have to trust you on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki judged that there shouldn't be any problems with leaving things to Sayuki. After all, she was the calligraphy club president, so she wouldn't do anything else to make the club suffer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the second culture festival day, at noon.</p>
<p class="null-p">All the council members were present inside Momosawa High's student council room. The student council president Takasaki Shiho, the vice president Fujimoto Ayano, the treasurer Nagase Airi, and the secretary Mitani Rin (men's clothing version), as well as the temporary member Kiryuu Keiki. These five people were sitting around a table. Keiki and Ayano were about to start their patrol shift when they suddenly received a call from Shiho, which told them to come to the student council office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like everyone's here. Let's have a short meeting before you go on your patrol," Shiho said after verifying that everyone was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although there's only one afternoon left for the festival, there's a problem that's rearing its head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it seems like the committee president overslept." "Eh, the president?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they were talking about the committee president, they were referring to the glasses-wearing upperclassman who had been part of the contest jury before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But didn't he just participate in the contest as one of the judges? He seemed completely fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the thing. Just after that, he confessed to a girl and got rejected." "Ahhh, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Getting excited because of the festival, and confessing in the heat of the moment-it was a story you would hear often. The president had probably gotten his hopes up and ended up crushed by a harsh rejection. But while Keiki was busy empathising with said committee president, Airi formed a fist with her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So who did the committee president confess to?" "Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, the student council president had trouble bringing out the words. The person answering him instead was Rintarou, one seat next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that was me." "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Keiki and Airi were unable to comprehend this new twist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When the event was over, the committee president just called out to me, and suddenly confessed to me like "Mitani-san, I like you! Please go out with me!…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could only guess that the committee president must've become interested in Rin during their preparations for the culture festival, and became unable to hold back his feelings, hence his confession. Maybe he even had an ulterior motive when he asked Rin to be the commentator for the event.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi made a sour face, possibly imagining the confession happening, as she spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what exactly did you tell the committee president, Rin?" "'I'm a boy after all, so I only have interest in girls', I said." "If I were the president, I'd jump from the roof for sure." "Poor guy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I feel bad for him, and I hate men."</p>
<p class="null-p">Finding out that the person he liked was actually a boy must've been a nightmare for the committee president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the vice president will be taking over in his place, so it's not that big of a deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, this sounds like a pretty big deal to me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, Keiki was worried for the committee president's psychological constitution.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, now for the real problem. We've received reports of a suspicious person walking around the school grounds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A suspicious person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, to keep it simple, a 'pervert'." "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't help but tense up at the word 'pervert.' At first, the faces of the girls from the calligraphy club came to his mind, but they should all be busy with the maid cafe. They shouldn't have the time to bring up problems on school grounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what kind of pervert are we talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see… She seems to be a young lady about 20 years old, and she's going around, calling out to boys and saying things like 'Do you want to do something good with Onee-san?'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How blatant of a pervert can you be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi snorted when she heard about this textbook example of a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you call out to boys like that? It'd make sense if they were girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not the problem here."</p>
<p class="null-p">A forbidden romance between an adult woman and a female high school student would start instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">From time to time, it really doesn't feel like Nagase-san has any intention of actually hiding her hobby from others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagase-san was the type of person who loved romantic stories with two girls</p>
<p class="null-p">-in other words, yuri. Although she was keen on hiding this fact from the other student council members, she would sometimes say dangerously revealing phrases like that one just now, which made Keiki panic every time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like the teachers are also on the lookout for said suspicious person, but they haven't had any luck in that regard yet. Though there's still the possibility that she's on school grounds anymore, we can't rest easy until we know for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes sense. I wouldn't want to leave any students open to any poisonous fangs."</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't forgive sex without love. That was the one and only policy that Kiryuu Keiki would never throw away. For Keiki, who was keen on giving his virginity to a person he loved, a woman who would try to lure in boys like this was an enemy; an arch nemesis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you know of it, think about safety, and always stay together in pairs. Keiki-kun with Ayano-chan, and Rin-chan with Airi-chan. Boys, take care of your female partner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I'm with Kiryuu-kun, then I'm safe no doubt." "Leave it to me! I will protect you, Airi-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I can't help it this time. And don't call me 'Airi-chan'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Airi clearly didn't seem happy with these pairings, she seemed to understand that the circumstances prevented her from complaining.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first glance, he might look like a beautiful girl, but Rin was a proper boy. He would surely be able to protect Airi from this pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, be careful while doing your patrol. I'll be going over to the committee's main office. Inform us as soon as possible if you spot the pervert. Is that clear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every member nodded at Shiho's words. "Then, let's start our afternoon job!" "Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, to protect the school's morals, the student council members started moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">After stepping out of the student council office, the Kiryuu ‐ Ayano team immediately started moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right, how about we look around inside the school building first?" "Understood, Officer Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san is the one above me though, since you're vice president." "Oh, that's right. Then Ayano-san will be the officer."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Ayano energetically puff out her chest was really cute. She looked up at her protector Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, I have a request for Kiryuu-kun." "What kind of request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I do a good job today, can I get Kiryuu-kun's underwear as a pres-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, what a shame… I thought it might work, considering the magic of the culture festival."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you keep up like that, you'll just end up depressed like the committee president."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki swore to himself that he would never give a girl his freshly-worn underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had been a few months since Ayano became interested in Keiki's smell. Even now, she wanted his underwear, and she would still cling to him if she found the opportunity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, let's start patrolling." "Understood, Officer Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano lined up next to Keiki as they started walking. When their eyes met, Ayano showed him a grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fujimoto-san really is cute when she's smiling…</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, her face was stoic, but sometimes she'd launch a surprise attack in the form of a beautiful smile. Fujimoto Ayano was very dedicated to her job as student council vice president. She was a very kind girl who would overwork herself for the sake of another person.</p>
<p class="null-p">She even cheered me up when I was having a fight with Sayuki-senpai, too…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hadn't known what to do, but she had given him a gentle push in the right direction. It was precisely because Ayano was there that he had been able to make up with Sayuki. That's why-</p>
<p class="null-p">I definitely have to tell Fujimoto-san…</p>
<p class="null-p">The answer that he had been postponing for all this time. That would only be respectful after all she had done for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, the classroom building is as empty as it can get." "Everyone is probably heading to the gym hall for the next event."</p>
<p class="null-p">Culture festivals always revolved around the big stage. There had been the costume contest in the morning, but coming up there was still a performance from the theater club and a concert from the wind music club. These were sure to attract attention from many of the visitors. Because of that, it made sense that the other places were sparsely visited.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, the cheerleading club's show is soon, as well." "Ahh, the boys will surely flock over there, I'm sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">Last year, Keiki and the other boys from his class had gone to check that out</p>
<p class="null-p">with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi said that she'd definitely go watch it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She should be doing her own patrol, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly, Keiki was worried that the yuri author's nose wouldn't stop bleeding from all the fantasies she'd have after seeing the cheerleaders working up a sweat like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I am interested in that performance, I'm more interested in what Takasaki-senpai was talking about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The talk about the pervert?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Why would someone go around inviting boys from a local high school?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe because her desires aren't satisfied?" "Well, that's the logical conclusion, but…" "Maybe she likes younger boys?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"These shotacons, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shotacons are the exact opposite of lolicons; they're women who desire younger boys, even the ones who are underage. Maybe that explained this suspicious pervert? If that was the case, then the chastity of the school's students and guests was in grave danger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that suspicious person is a shotacon, maybe we use Rintarou's chastity as bait?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would endanger Mitani-kun's chastity, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but… If we leave that pervert alone, we'll endanger the chastity of the other boys."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's also true… Maybe it'd be good to consider the thought process of that suspicious person and try to guess where she'll go next."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good idea. That way we can catch her before she can even go on the</p>
<p class="null-p">offensive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Kiryuu-kun did something bad at school, what would you do after that?" "I'd try to hide in a place with nobody else around. For example-"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked around, a classroom that normally wasn't used suddenly entered his field of view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This empty classroom is definitely a good place to hide." Thinking that, he slowly opened up the door-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, Koharu-chan? Don't be embarrassed. Say it a bit louder." "R-Really… This is the last time, okay? Shouma-oniichan~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_18.jpg">
<p class="null-p">They were greeted by quite the unbelievable scene. During this time of the day, inside this certain classroom, Shouma was forcing Koharu to do a younger sister roleplay.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma is making Koharu-senpai call him 'Onii-chan'…" "I didn't expect to see this today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Keiki?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Fujimoto-san?!" "Pardon our intrusion~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing that they had interrupted the couple's fun, the accidental intruders quickly closed the door again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, there doesn't seem to be a problem there, so let's check the next room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, we didn't see anything. Nor did we hear anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">While the two of them decided to act like nothing happened, the door swung open and Shouma ran towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both of you! Wait! Please listen to what I have to say!" "I don't wanna hear anything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a good reason for this! Since I only have older sisters at home, I was always envious of people who had little sisters, so I just wanted to be called 'Onii-chan' by someone once!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that your dream was finally realised."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he had probably forgotten about the fact that Koharu was actually older than him…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm surprised that Koharu-senpai played along."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since it's Shouma-kun, I want to fulfill any lingering wishes that he has." "Senpai really is an angel."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma really caught himself a cute girlfriend. "By the way, what were you two doing here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, we were searching for a suspicious person around this area." "A suspicious person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, there seems to be a pervert going around trying to seduce boys." Ayano gave a simple explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? So even a city like ours has its fair share of dangerous individuals." "I think that a lolicon can also be considered a dangerous individual."</p>
<p class="null-p">From time to time, Keiki felt a bit worried when he saw Shouma smiling after grade school girls while walking home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you two seen anything weird going on, by any chance?" Keiki asked Shouma and Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… Not really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing of that sort. The only thing we saw was a male student running around crying 'There's no way there could be a boy as cute as that!', but that's about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… That was probably the committee president…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He really was an unfortunate person to have confessed to a boy wearing girls' clothes. It would surely take some time before his broken heart could be repaired.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll contact you if we see anything," added Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that'd be great. We'll be on our way now, so feel free to continue your Onii-chan roleplay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand, so please forget about that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After teasing the cute Shouma, Keiki and Ayano returned to their patrol. "Akiyama-kun and Ootori-senpai are as close as ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm really envious of them."</p>
<p class="null-p">While he started imagining how they would look as a married couple, Keiki's smartphone vibrated in his pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm? Takasaki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that it was a call from the student council president, Keiki quickly answered it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello?"</p>
<p class="null-p">>Ah, Keiki-kun? Sorry about the sudden call.< "No problem. What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">>About the suspicious person, we received information of a sighting in the first year's haunted house. She called out to a boy who was playing a mummy.<</p>
<p class="null-p">"So even a mummy isn't safe…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like the pervert was quite high-leveled.</p>
<p class="null-p">>Also, here's another piece of information. That suspicious person seems to be an indescribable beauty.<</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Beauties tend to be perverts, you know," Keiki replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">>Eh…?<</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry… It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's tongue slipped, maybe to vent some frustration when he remembered his own situation. Because of that, it was always 'Beauty = Pervert' in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, we'll ask the witness."</p>
<p class="null-p">>Please do.<</p>
<p class="null-p">Cutting the phone call with Shiho, Keiki put away his smartphone. "What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've gotten some new information on the suspicious person. Let's go to the haunted house."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The haunted house is the one that Nagase-san's class is doing, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The day before, Airi was even wearing cosplay for it while acting as the receptionist. When they arrived at the front of the classroom, an adult-looking girl wearing a yuki-onna cosplay lifted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome. Would you like the couple admission?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, we're not here to go in. We're from the student council and we're investigating the suspicious person who's been going around. We heard that someone from your class talked with this person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, but could you call that person over here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… There was just a customer who just went inside, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time the yuki-onna finished her sentence, you could hear blood- curdling screams like "Nooooooooooooooooooo!" from a girl and "Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" from a boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two members of the student council swallowed their words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it seems it'll take just a bit longer. If you don't have time to wait, you can go inside and talk to him. He should be in the back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">So, she was telling them to enter the haunted house? "What should we do, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a bit scared, but the number of victims might go up if we waste time like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If they wasted any more time like this, the pervert might dig her poisonous fangs into an innocent boy. Keiki couldn't allow that happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no other choice but to go in there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're scared, Ayano-san will hold your hand?" "Oh my, Fujimoto-san is so cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Mizuha and Sayuki were bad with horror stuff, Ayano might actually prove to be a reliable partner here. And thus, the two of them set foot into the haunted house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">To get the obvious out of the way, the haunted house was incredibly scary. Not to mention that the quality of the scares and props were top-notch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey? Am I pretty?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they turned a corner, a realistic-looking kuchisake-onna greeted them. (T/N: 'Slit mouth woman')</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give me back my face!" "Uwaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When a noppera-bō suddenly appeared as well, Keiki couldn't hold back his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">(T/N: a mythical being with flat featureless face)</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is clearly more than just a highschool haunted house…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started doubting if they hadn't gotten some pros to design the costumes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty scary, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, isn't your reaction a bit too calm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It just doesn't show on my face. My heart is beating like crazy… Do you want to feel it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say that. My heart's gonna race for a different reason." "It'd be fine though… Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun… Over there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano stopped in her tracks, and pointed past Keiki. She was pointing at a blood-drenched female ghost-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly attacked by fear, Keiki unintentionally clung to Ayano. When he smelled her sweet, girly aroma and felt her softness, that fear immediately turned into embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… S-Sorry…" "No problem…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ghost disappeared shortly after, and the girl's cheeks were slightly</p>
<p class="null-p">flushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm used to being the one hugging, but being hugged like this is really embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't get Fujimoto-san sometimes."</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki felt like hugging her again, seeing that cute reaction of hers. Now that he was thinking about it, entering a haunted house together with a girl was quite the normie activity. If things kept going like this, they might get even closer, and end up a couple-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaah… Haaah…" "Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was busy having rose-coloured fantasies, he realized that something weird was happening with Ayano. Her breathing was getting rough, and her face was turning red. Her eyes looked like she was in heat, and she was holding her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you not feeling well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not… like that… I'm sorry… I might've gotten a bit excited." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you suddenly hugged me like that, your smell just…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because of my smell again?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… It's Kiryuu-kun's fault… So please… Take responsibility?" "Responsibility? …Wait, don't just put your hand on my belt?!" "Haah… Haah… Underwear… Kiryuu-kun's underwear…" "Fujomoto-san?! I beg you, please come back to reality!!" "Underweaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrr!!!" "Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, he managed to protect his underwear. The scream that rang out through the haunted house was oddly different from one that you would normally hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ayano returned back to reality, she and Keiki safely made it through the haunted house and arrived at the mummy boy. After speaking to him outside the haunted house, they learned some valuable new information. The suspicious person seemed to be a beauty with long hair who was wearing a long skirt. And, contrary to her actions, she seemed to have quite the lady- like atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had visited the haunted house on her own and had apparently gone up to the mummy boy and asked him "Do you want to do something good with Onee-san?".</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki asked the boy why he denied the offer from a beautiful older lady, the boy became flustered and said "Because I have a girlfriend…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cheeky first-year brat. Having a girlfriend already…" "Kiryuu-kun, grow up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oops, my jealousy got the better of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Keiki felt a bit bad for letting his inner emotions get a hold of him,</p>
<p class="null-p">he had never once had a girlfriend in his life after all, so this much should be forgiven.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, the girlfriend of the mummy boy seemed to be the yuki-onna who was manning the reception.</p>
<p class="null-p">After separating from the couple, Keiki and Ayano went to the corner of the school cafeteria and started compiling all the information they had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, please don't just get excited all of a sudden, okay?" "I really feel bad about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I was the one who suddenly clung to you, so let's just call it even." "No complaints from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But we did get some new information on the suspicious person, so that's a plus."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. She has long hair, and she's wearing a long skirt." "Finding her shouldn't be too difficult now that we know this." They were one step closer to catching her now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just then, Keiki's phone once again started vibrating. When he checked the screen, he saw that this time it was a call from Airi…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello? Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">>Ah, Kiryuu-senpai?! There's a big problem! Right now, the suspicious person is making a move on Mitani!<</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">>I request immediate assistance! We're in the courtyard!< "Understood!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cutting the call, Keiki gave Ayano a quick rundown.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The suspicious person seems to be attacking Rintarou right now! Let's hurry to the courtyard!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If they caught the pervert now, they would be able to protect the school's morals. Not to mention everyone's chastity.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they rushed into the courtyard, they immediately spotted Rintarou and a woman. Since she had her back turned to them, they couldn't make out her face, but just like the mummy boy had reported, she had long hair and was wearing a long skirt. There was no mistake that she was the suspicious person who was causing a ruckus right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your face looks just like a girl, you know?" "Ah, well… I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, are you getting flustered? That's so cute. Can I take you home with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, that's a bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou seemed to be a bit uncomfortable to be so openly invited like that. Airi was standing a bit away from them, not knowing what to do, nervously tapping her foot. Since the suspicious person was attacking the small-statured Rintarou, they indeed seemed to be a shotacon. But whatever the case may be, the situation was dangerous, so there was no time for discretion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've finally found you, you pervert!" "Hmm? Pervert, you mean me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In slow motion, the so-called pervert turned around. Her long, beautiful hair fluttered in the wind, and her face was indeed as beautiful as described-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh? Kei-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…? Y-Yuuhi-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's Akiyama-kun's older sister." "It's been a while, you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who greeted them with a smile was indeed an acquaintance of Keiki and Ayano. To their shock, the suspicious intruder was actually the younger Akiyama sister: Akiyama Yuuhi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the student council office, located on the third floor of the normal classroom building, Keiki and Ayano were sitting on a sofa together with Yuuhi. On top of the table was tea prepared by Ayano, but nobody was drinking any of it as of yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what exactly were you thinking, Yuuhi-san? Seducing high school students like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she was interrogated, the girl awkwardly turned her gaze away. Since the suspicious person was actually an acquaintance of Keiki and Ayano, they decided to take her to the student council office, away from any prying eyes, and thoroughly question her. But the problems didn't stop there-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Onee-san, you reek of alcohol."</p>
<p class="null-p">"True. Just how much have you been drinking…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The odor was so intense that the sensitive Ayano had to pinch her nose with one hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, is Yuuhi-san already at the age where she's allowed to drink alcohol?" "…I'm 20 already, so it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if it is, an adult like you trying to seduce a minor definitely isn't." "Uuugh… I can't help it! I'm lonely!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lonely?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just earlier, my boyfriend I had just started dating broke up with me…" "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The committee president before, and now Yuuhi. Today was full of love and broken hearts apparently. Keiki couldn't get angry at Yuuhi after seeing her teary eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… So why did he break up with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… He said that he hated bitches like me… 'I thought you'd be a proper girl this time, and you lie to me like this,' he complained and he left me standing there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki found himself having trouble commenting about any of this. "Fujimoto-san, help me," he whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is too heavy for Ayano-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki looked to Ayano for help, she just shook her head. Neither her nor Keiki were exactly the best people to ask for love advice, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was at home trying to drink away my sorrow, but I heard that Shou-chan's school had a culture festival today, so I got excited when I thought about all the boys walking around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was totally a bad idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe it was a bad idea to invite him over to a hotel the day we started dating?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Akiyama Yuuhi might look like a pure woman, she had already</p>
<p class="null-p">gathered mountains of experience. Keiki could totally understand the shock that her now ex-boyfriend must have gone through after finding out about that disparity. But telling her that would be no consolation whatsoever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then that must just mean that this person wasn't destined to be with you. Yuuhi-san is beautiful, so I'm sure that you'll find someone else," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Helping a person to get back on their feet when they were down. That was the same thing that Ayano had done for Keiki when he was feeling down because of his fight with Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-chan… you're so kind…" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might actually… like Kei-chan…" "Excuse me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Keiki's words had a different kind of effect on her. But before he could completely understand the situation, she was already approaching him. Her eyes made her look like she was drunk on love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's probably just a misunderstanding! You're just drunk!" "Muu… It's not a misunderstanding at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pouting like a small child, Yuuhi suddenly clung to the younger boy. She even started rubbing her cheek on his chest.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_19.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"I like you, Kei-chan. Do you want to do something good with Onee-chan?" "I wholeheartedly decline! If you don't stop, I'll seriously report you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this rate, Keiki's own chastity would be in danger. "P-Please save me, Fujimoto-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu-kun, you're such a womanizer." "Fujimoto-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when Keiki asked the trustworthy student council vice president for help, the girl only averted her gaze with a pout. 'Do something about it yourself' was what she probably wanted to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Yuuhi-san? Could you please let go of me now?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this rate, even I'm going to start smelling like alcohol." "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mm? Yuuhi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no response whatsoever. When Keiki looked down to check, he found that the girl's eyelids were shut. She had fallen asleep in the midst of all of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She has quite some nerve to fall asleep now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">You certainly couldn't predict a drunken person's actions. Suddenly confessing non-existent feelings, being clingy, and falling asleep in the blink of an eye weren't all that weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way Fujimoto-san, why are you sitting so far away from me now?" "Because Onee-san and Kiryuu-kun reek of alcohol."</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably not able to stand the smell, Ayano had already evacuated to an open window. Although Keiki wanted to follow suit, Yuuhi's grip on him prohibited that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah, just what should we do with this drunkard?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Keiki was seriously wondering about how to deal with this whole situation, a knock came from the door, which opened slowly after.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, Shouma, perfect timing."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Yuuhi's younger brother. The moment they had found out about the suspicious person's identity, Keiki sent an email to Shouma. Upon inspecting the scene in front of him however, Shouma gave a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Just what kind of situation did I walk in on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuuhi-san seems to be pretty drunk, so when we were talking about this and that, she suddenly clung to me. And Fujimoto-san is bad when it comes to the smell of alcohol."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's why she's standing away that far…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming satisfied with that explanation, Shouma came towards the sofa. "Really, Yuu-nee… Sorry about my older sister troubling you like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not that much of a deal, but what should we do with her? Should we get her to the nurse's office?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need to worry about that. I called my parents. They'll come pick her up with a car."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? That's a relief."</p>
<p class="null-p">With the strength of a sports club member, Shouma picked up the sleeping princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah… She really does smell like alcohol." "You'd be able to get drunk just off the smell, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you can say that again-Anyway, I'll be going now." "Ayo, be careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching his friend leave the room, Keiki let out a deep sigh at the solved suspicious person incident.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew… I'm really tired all of a sudden…" "I really thought I'd get sick from that smell." "Yeah, same here."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the drunkard was gone, Ayano returned from the window. "…Kiryuu-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you going out with Onee-san?" "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She confessed so heatedly, so I thought that you might." "Confessed? She was just drunk, nothing more."</p>
<p class="null-p">She would probably forget about that confession when she woke up. Not even Yuuhi could fall in love that easily. But that wasn't important right now…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me. Fujimoto-san, are you jealous?" "…I am."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all-Kiryuu-kun is Ayano-san's one and only hugging pillow." "I am not."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki had already anticipated that kind of response, she was still a pervert through and through. She had probably felt jealous that her precious hugging pillow might be taken away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's go back to work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before that, I think it'd be better if we took a short break." "We can't do that, though. The others are working as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you'd say that, so I asked the president for permission."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following that, Ayano took out her smartphone and showed the screen to Keiki. It was a chat with Shiho, and the last two messages were…</p>
<p class="null-p">'Request for a break' from Ayano. 'Go ahead~' from Shiho.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun looked really pale every since this morning. I was really worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I really can't win against Fujimoto-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki had to come up with emergency measures for the maid cafe, he hadn't gotten much sleep last night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I guess I'll get a bit of rest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think you'll get much sleep on the sofa. How about I give you a lap pillow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm thankful for that, but I have to decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I want to… Is it still no good?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't decline anymore after seeing Ayano this adamant. "Why did it end up like this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, Keiki was laying down face-up on the sofa, his head on Ayano's lap. Though he had experienced this so-called lap pillow countless times already, he felt like he would never be able to get used to this. The fact that Ayano was softly stroking Keiki's hair certainly didn't help the embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. I'll wake you up in 30 minutes, okay?" "No pulling off my pants while I'm defenseless, okay?" "I can't guarantee anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm kidding. I won't, I promise." "I'm really trusting you on this."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_20.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided to believe Ayano, and slowly closed his eyes. Just by doing that, he felt his consciousness slowly starting to drift away to the land of dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Listen, Fujimoto-san." "Mmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once the culture festival is over, I'll go back to the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the answer he still had to give her, in response to Ayano's wish for him to stay in the student council. With a saddened smile, Ayano opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I knew. I knew it the moment you decided to protect the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like the girl had said, Keiki had known the answer already back then. Maybe Ayano decided to cheer for him exactly because she knew of his feelings back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a shame that you won't stay in the student council, but I still won't give up on Kiryuu-kun's underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd be really great if you gave up on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">When they were joking back and forth a bit, Keiki felt his heart getting lighter. It was exactly because of these ways that she cared for him that he had started liking her even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if your job gets too rough, feel free to call for me whenever." "Yeah, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Keiki finally reached his limit. After that last exchange, while feeling the warmth coming from the girl, Keiki's consciousness slowly faded into a deep sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">Later that day in the evening, preparations for a closing party in the living room of the Kiryuu household were complete.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, don't we need more food?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think this much should be enough, right?" "I'd love to eat some pizza now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai, it'd be bad if you gained any more weight, you know?" "Though in club prez' case, it all seems to go to the chest."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the members of the calligraphy club had changed out of their school uniforms, they lined up the various foods and drinks on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, I'm glad that everything ended safely…</p>
<p class="null-p">After getting some good rest in the student council office, Keiki returned back to his job, but the culture festival came to an end with no other incidents. When Keiki returned to the maid cafe, four girls were waiting for him while making V signs with their fingers. Thanks to the earnings from the second festival day, they had been able to pay back their debt, and had averted the disbanding of the calligraphy club. When Keiki brought up the idea to have a celebration party, everyone immediately agreed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, writing with ketchup this whole time made my shoulders really stiff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. You had to make up for all the work you skipped out on," jabbed Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it was really difficult, you know? I tried it as well, but I couldn't do it like Tokihara-senpai did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I think that only someone with equivalent skill to club prez would've been able to do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Writing complicated letters with ketchup like that was definitely difficult. Still, not even a genius like her would've been able to do it flawlessly, so she must've practiced throughout the whole night. Just like the day when Keiki had spotted Cinderella's panties, when she had to enter a work of hers for a contest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai." "What is it?" "-Welcome back." "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, her eyes went wide, but… "-No, welcome back."</p>
<p class="null-p">She showed him the smile he wanted to see. That alone was more than enough of a reward for him. Just like being in the club she treasures so much. In the end, they were still fellow club members. It was because everyone had worked without a break for the future where they could spend time like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. I bought a pound cake." "Ohh, that's nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika also brought some canned juice with her. It's in the box over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah… That's so nice of you to bring that along…" "Then let's start cutting the cake."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once everyone had a piece of cake and a drink, they sat down on the sofa. Of course, the one who started the celebration party was none other than the calligraphy club president herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, to celebrate our success at the maid cafe, and to celebrate having paid back the debt-Cheers!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cheers!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They hit their glasses against one another, and the party started. Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mmmnh… Ah, it's morning already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The day following the culture festival, Keiki woke up to a dim ray of light hitting his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I forgot to close the curtains, huh…? Ouch… My head hurts for some reason…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Keiki had been so tired from last night's party that he had completely forgotten to close the curtains of his room. Sadly, though the weather outside was wonderful, his physical state after waking up was the worst. He slowly got up from bed while holding his head with one hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, an unbelievable scene unfolded before his eyes. Glossy black hair was in complete contrast to the white sheets. When he glanced beneath said sheets, he was greeted by an uncovered, buxom chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why… Is Sayuki-senpai here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The naked Sayuki was sound asleep next to her confused Kouhai, a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Even so, I won't do it</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">After doing a toast with the canned juice, the club members immediately started on the pound cake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah, what is this cake?! It's crazy delicious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. Though it has a peculiar aroma, it's actually pretty good." Mizuha agreed when Keiki gave his opinion on the cake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But as for the smell, do you think that there might be some alcohol in it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. This is about as much alcohol as they put sweets for children. Nobody would be affected by this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right! It'd be a waste to not eat something as delicious as this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Sayuki and Yuika gave groundless assurances in response to Mao's concerned question. Since it was Sayuki who had brought the cake with her, she brought up the low percentage of alcohol, and everyone was satisfied with that. They wouldn't get drunk from something like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">In hindsight, everyone had already gone crazy. They should have learned from the chocolate disaster back at the seaside training camp. But alas, they once again failed to see their mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the reason for this atrocious headache is that pound cake, huh?" Keiki muttered to himself as he pushed himself up from the bed, reminiscing about</p>
<p class="null-p">what had happened yesterday. Normally, that miniscule amount of alcohol mixed into a cake wouldn't pose that much of a problem, but the group had been constantly working hard for the past few days. Just like it was easier to catch a cold if your immune system was weakened, it made sense to assume that even this amount of alcohol could impact someone under such stress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's gaze wandered towards a certain open beverage can, that was sitting on top of his desk. He had probably brought it back with him from the living room. At first glance, it looked like a normal canned drink, but on the bottom, in small letters, it seemed to Keiki like it said 'Alcoholic.' That must've just been his imagination, though, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, it has to be. I'm just imagining things right now because of this headache."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was nothing more than a normal juice can. Keiki was just too tired, and was just seeing weird letters on the can. There's no way that the juice that Yuika brought with her was actually chûhai, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">"That aside…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he glanced over towards his bed, Sayuki was still there, sound asleep. Without even needing to lift up the blanket, he could still tell that she wasn't wearing anything on her upper body. Keiki could only guess that she was still wearing her panties, since, unlike her pink bra and shirt, he wasn't able to spot them lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What would be the right response in this situation?" A: For now, I'll just fondle my Senpai's breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">B: Take a commemorative photo with the two of us. C: Act like I didn't see anything and go back to bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leaving aside the completely horrendous A and B answers, the problem won't be resolved if I just go back to bed again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Still half asleep, with the headache still assaulting him, Keiki couldn't come up with anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Senpai even sleeping in my room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could still remember the party down in the living room, but, probably because of the alcohol, everything after they had started eating the cake was hazy. He could only faintly remember that they had decided to let everyone stay over since it had gotten pretty late…</p>
<p class="null-p">A sleepover, with both of them sleeping in the same bed. And, considering her current attire, there was only one conclusion that Keiki could possibly reach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah?! D-Don't tell me, did Sayuki-senpai and I…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did he commit a faux-pas with a person of the opposite sex whom he wasn't even dating? Although Keiki had kept preaching that there was no meaning in doing it without any love, he had lost against the temptation of her big breasts, and had climbed the stairs to adulthood with her?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no no. Wait wait wait! There's no need to jump the gun here." He shouldn't jump to conclusions just by looking at the current situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Keiki had no recollection of what had happened the previous night. He couldn't write anything in stone before asking Sayuki about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mmmm… Hmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Possibly in response to her Kouhai's voice, the upperclassman's eyes squinted as she slowly opened them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuaaaah… Ara? Good morning, Keiki-kun." "So you're finally awake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I had a wonderful night's sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">Answering in her usual manner, Sayuki slowly raised her body. As a result, the bedsheets that were the only thing covering her upper body fell, and her beautiful skin made its way into Keiki's line of sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Sayuki-senpai?! Your breasts! Hide your breasts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Breasts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She glanced down at her body. "Ahh, I must've stripped in my sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">Muttering to herself like it wasn't her problem, she slowly moved to pick up her bra from the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's embarrassing like this, so could you turn around for a second?" "I'm already turned around!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if Keiki-kun wants to see them no matter what, then I might-" "Just hurry up and put on some clothes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If someone else saw them like this, all hell would break loose. And Keiki</p>
<p class="null-p">couldn't bet on the fact that the others were still asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing her Kouhai's reaction, the girl gave a slight giggle as she put on her bra, followed by her shirt. She slowly buttoned it up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your lower half is still in quite the state… But that should be enough for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">It couldn't be helped, however, since her skirt was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying his hardest not to look at her panties as they occasionally entered his field of view, Keiki asked the girl the question that was on his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Sayuki-senpai, about last night…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki cut off his sentence, Sayuki's cheeks went red for whatever reason. And, seeming embarrassed, the girl averted her gaze to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Eh? W-What kind of suspicious reaction is that?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if something tremendously bad, something that never should have happened, had occurred…</p>
<p class="null-p">And while the boy was feeling this well-known after-your-first-time awkward atmosphere, the girl's next words drove the point home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yesterday, Keiki-kun was so… rough… that I really thought I would break."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">This bold declaration made Keiki look up to the ceiling in complete silence. Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">I might've climbed the stairs to adulthood without me even realizing it…</p>
<p class="null-p">The long holiday after the culture festival ended, and it was now a normal Wednesday morning. He was waiting at a crosswalk together with his little sister, and his thoughts drifted to the topic of his chastity. Even during the holidays, he had been constantly thinking about it, and a normal school day had already arrived without him being able to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, none of the other calligraphy club members had found out about Sayuki spending the night in Keiki's room, but the thought of him having been deflowered forbade him from finding any joy in that.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it's still too early to decide on anything…</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no definite proof that Keiki and Sayuki had performed any sexual relations that evening. To rid himself of this needless worrying, the first thing he should do was to find out the truth from the other person involved, but he</p>
<p class="null-p">really couldn't see himself bluntly asking Sayuki 'Did we have sex?'</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd be way too embarrassing if Keiki was just thinking too much into it, but if it turned out to be the truth, then he'd feel like garbage since he had his first time while being drunk.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should I do about this…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's train of thought ended when Mizuha spoke up. "Nii-san. The light's green, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He hurriedly followed her across the street. After they crossed the street, his little sister looked at Keiki with a worried look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is everything okay? You're kinda spacing out today." "No problem. My body is in top condition."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Well I can't blame you for it, after how stressful the culture festival was."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The culture festival…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot has happened this year…</p>
<p class="null-p">They quickly threw together a maid cafe to earn money, he had to patrol through the school during his work for the student council, the committee president had been rejected by a boy he thought was a girl, he had seen Shouma and Koharu during their 'Onii-chan' roleplay, and he had to deal with the drunken Yuuhi who had temporarily turned into a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that the calligraphy club can keep going." "Yeah, it's all thanks to everyone's efforts."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, they had managed to make the maid cafe a success, and they had barely avoided the disbandment of the calligraphy club. Everyone was happy about that, of course.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Nii-san even managed to make up with Tokihara-senpai." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That much was a huge relief. However, their current relationship was in yet another round of turmoil after recent events.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, you don't remember anything about the evening of our party, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope. We ate some cake, and we spent some time talking together, but when I came to my senses, I was sleeping in my room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something happen?" "No, it's fine. Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">So Mizuha had gone through the same thing as Keiki after eating the alcohol- infused cake.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess I'll ask Nanjou and Yuika-chan about it later, as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">if Keiki could figure out the details of why Sayuki had gone into to his room, he would surely get a step closer to the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he decided on his plan of attack, they had already arrived at school. After parting ways with Mizuha, he put on his indoor slippers and made his way towards his classroom. While he was still walking, he met up with a familiar upperclassman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara? Good morning, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"G-Good morning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she spotted her Kouhai, the girl showed him a kind smile. Although Keiki somehow managed to force out a greeting, looking her in the face was still too difficult for him. In response, he averted his gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Sayuki-senpai? About the night of our party…" "Ahh, so you were worried about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine, okay? Though it stung a bit, and it felt a bit uncomfortable to walk for a while, it's completely fine now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Izu dato sou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Uhh, what part of her stung, exactly? What's fine now?</p>
<p class="null-p">The more I talk with Senpai, the more my nightmares seem to be coming true…</p>
<p class="null-p">With her tsunami of easy-to-misunderstand statements, Keiki's bad premonition continued to grow.</p>
<p class="null-p">So why does Sayuki-senpai seem so happy about it?</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was actually grinning to herself, clearly seeming to be in a very good mood. Keiki would've greatly appreciated it if she stopped fidgeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">These sort of things happen in those perverted mangas. The depiction of the girl, just having had her first time, saying that she 'feels different' and that 'it only stung a bit', while she's trying to walk it off…</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking this way, Keiki realized it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't Sayuki-senpai the perfect picture of that?</p>
<p class="null-p">With all those thoughts running through his mind, cold sweat started running</p>
<p class="null-p">down his cheek. As if she wanted to tell him a secret, Sayuki moved closer and whispered into his ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was embarrassing… But let's do it again if we get the time, okay?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll see you after school."</p>
<p class="null-p">In contrast to the boy going through a crisis, the girl wore another very easily misinterpreted look on her face as she left him behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really… What did I do that night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">During lunch break, Keiki singled out Mao and took her with him to the courtyard. They sat next to each other on the bench and opened their lunch boxes. After finding good timing for it, Keiki spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about the night of the party?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something weird happen back then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you talking about when we got drunk from the cake that club prez brought with her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's one part of it, but is there anything aside from that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… Though my memories are hazy… I remember Kiryuu getting all energetic and imitating Akiyama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wait, I did something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you lifted up your bangs, and arrogantly said something like 'All the lolis in the world belong to me!' or something like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although it's Shouma we're talking about, I normally wouldn't go that far…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Acting like somebody else in his drunkenness was quite the scary thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After that, I remember the club prez talking loudly about some sex talk and dirty jokes, Yuika forcing Kiryuu out, Mizuha starting to strip, and myself suddenly came up with some material for my BL manga, so I started drawing that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, the same as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, we all kept drinking and eating, and since it was pretty late, we decided to stay over at your house."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu and Mizuha went up on the second floor, and Yuika and I used the futons in the guest bedroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. What about Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Club prez was sound asleep on the sofa, so we put some blankets on top of her and that was it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So basically, Sayuki had probably woken up at a later point in time and made her way to Keiki's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that reminds me…" "What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I woke up sometime in the middle of the night. During that time, Yuika wasn't in the guestroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She wasn't?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that she had probably gone to the toilet, but when she came back after a bit, she was acting a bit off…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She had a blanket over her head, and she was shaking. Almost like she had seen a ghost."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A ghost?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew that she was using a metaphor here, but he really would like it if she didn't use such vocabulary in front of someone living in said house.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if it wasn't a ghost, then why was Yuika shaking? "Even when we got up, she was still acting a bit weird." "Now that you mention it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika had seemed a bit off when she greeted Keiki the following morning. Back when they were eating Mizuha's homemade breakfast, Yuika seemed nervous about something. She had constantly glanced at Keiki, who was sitting across the table from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, Nanjou. That was really helpful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really know how that was helpful, but no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to Mao's side of the story, Keiki separated from her, saying that he wanted to check something in the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe Yuika-chan knows something."</p>
<p class="null-p">While he walked down the hallway, Keiki pondered the information he had heard from Mao. The change was high that Yuika knew valuable information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, Keiki-senpai." "Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He met up with the exact girl he was just thinking about in front of the stairs. "What a coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hello there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like to ask you something. Do you have time right now?" "There's something you want to ask…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it's about the night of the party." "?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard that, Yuika seemed visibly shaken. "…Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-My apologies. Yuika has something important to do right now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After quickly cutting off the conversation, his Kouhai escaped down the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">From start to finish, Yuika had seemed nervous about something. As proof of that, the girl wouldn't meet Keiki's gaze at all. It seemed a lot like she was running away. No doubt it was connected to something that had happened on the night of the party.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan definitely knows something."</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes ended, Keiki, after leaving the classroom, tried to come up with a plan for what to do from here onward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The question is: How do I get Yuika-chan to tell me about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the reason for it was unclear, the girl was avoiding him. Considering how she had acted during lunch break, she might just run away if he confronted her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, there's no choice but to attack head-on."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't a fan of using brute force against a girl, but his life might depend on what she knows.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I really did it with Sayuki, then she might use it against me and force me to become her master…</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the boy decided to look around the school for his target. He soon spotted Yuika coming out of a classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, come with me for a bit!" "E-Eh, Senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking the bewildered girl's hand, he pulled her into an empty classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What happened that would cause you to force Yuika in here?" said Yuika as she tried to distance herself from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Keiki put both his hands on her shoulders. "Please, Yuika-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I beg you, tell me about the night of the party!" "Again with that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something weird happen back then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't know anything, and she didn't see anything." "That totally makes it sound like you know something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't remember, then you're better off not knowing. Yuika would</p>
<p class="null-p">prefer it if she hadn't seen that side of Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that?! That makes me even more interested, though!" "…Haah, I can't help it then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika finally gave in against her Senpai's obstinate begging. Keiki took his hands off her shoulder, and the girl started explaining what had happened that night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That night, Yuika heard weird sounds in the hallway when she was making her way towards the toilet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of weird sounds?" "Like a slap. Something being hit." "A slap?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it because he was a virgin that he couldn't help but imagine that the sound had originated from something indecent? No, was he even still a virgin in the first place?</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was curious about what had caused that sound, Yuika went up the stairs to Keiki-senpai's room, and…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…A-And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She slowly opened the door, and spotted Keiki-senpai with Witch-senpai, illuminated by the moonlight…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me and Sayuki-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki gulped when they arrived at the meat of the story. "…! N-Nothing more of that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But all of a sudden, the girl suddenly stopped without telling him the rest. "Yuika didn't expect Keiki-senpai to be this much of a fiend!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you're Yuika's slave, doing… Something like that…!" As she hesitated, tears started building up in Yuika's eyes. "………The butt is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The butt isn't made for that!" "What are we talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving this bizarre phrase behind, Yuika dashed out of the classroom. For some reason, she was holding her butt while doing that. While watching her leave, Keiki pondered the words she had left behind.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_21.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"The butt isn't made for that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So basically, Yuika had seen something related to a butt. With this new information, Keiki tried to grasp what had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">A young boy and a girl are doing something involving a butt inside the boy's room-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah?! D-Don't tell me, my first ended up in Sayuki-senpai's butt…?!" Did he have any hidden urges that even he didn't know of?</p>
<p class="null-p">No, Keiki still held out hope that Sayuki was the one who had asked him to be treated roughly, because she seemed like the kind of person who would enjoy that. A molesting hardcore masochistic girl wouldn't be satisfied by anything normal, probably. At the very least, it would make what she had said make sense. She said something like "You were very rough and aggressive", right?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no… that couldn't have happened… Right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as he tried to desperately convince himself, his voice wouldn't clear his doubts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I actually more of a perverted bastard than I thought…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What if he called the girls of the calligraphy club perverts all the time, but was a butt fetishist himself? That would be too much of a shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? Nobody's here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he peeked into the calligraphy clubroom, he only spotted a single schoolbag on a chair, but no club members were in sight. Yuika had probably taken the day off, Mao had already gone home to work on her manuscript, and Mizuha had said something about a sale for mayonnaise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically… it's just Sayuki-senpai and I today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To put it simply, this would probably be pretty awkward. After all, Keiki had</p>
<p class="null-p">come to believe that some sort of abnormal thing had happened between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe I should also make up a reason and go home… It happened while the chicken boy was thinking that. "-Ke-i-ki-Kun~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhyaaaaaaaaaaan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard his name called from behind his back, he lout out a shriek. "Ara ara, a perfect reaction as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing all of a sudden?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was plain as day as to who would play childish pranks like this. That was why Keiki wasn't surprised to find Tokihara Sayuki when he turned around. On the way there, he had spotted an open locker. She had probably hid in there, waiting for her chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai is just… Are you going to stay a kid forever?" "I think that teasing Keiki-kun might be my destiny." "It's nothing more than a bother!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so he said, but he felt somewhat nostalgic during this exchange. Before Keiki had gone off as a temporary student council member, this was how things had always gone when the two of them were in the clubroom. Being teased by his upperclassman like this had gotten fun. This feeling was still as strong as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's all thanks to Keiki-kun." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That we managed to avoid our club disbanding. This wouldn't have</p>
<p class="null-p">happened without you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But I didn't manage to do anything in the end. If it weren't for your help in the maid cafe, we probably would have ended up in the red."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it weren't for the photo you sent me, I probably would've given up because I thought I was all alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So thank you. It's all thanks to Keiki-kun that we managed to protect the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you. These words made his chest feel hot. They told him that his efforts weren't in vain. It made him feel glad that he had worked this hard for the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Keiki-kun, are you free today?" "I don't have plans today, no."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about you come to my house?" "Senpai's house?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. My mother told me to bring you over because she had something she wanted to talk about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your mother does?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had met Sayuki's mother on the day before the culture festival. She looked so young that one might mistake her for a high school student.</p>
<p class="null-p">But… why now?</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, Kiryuu Keiki was trying to figure out if he had a physical relationship with Tokihara Sayuki. Being called over by the girl's mother</p>
<p class="null-p">right now…</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be weird if Keiki didn't get suspicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">N-No way… they're telling me to take responsibility and marry her… Am I going to be married off?!</p>
<p class="null-p">If his current fears turned into reality, and the girl had already talked with her parents about it, this might very well be a plausible course of action for them to take.</p>
<p class="null-p">While feelings of despair were starting to surface in Keiki's mind… "What do you want to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Please let me accompany you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Until his suspicions had been cleared up, Keiki couldn't run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Tokihara residence imposingly stood out from the other houses in the neighbourhood. After accompanying the girl to her house, Keiki found himself unable to step through the gate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… Sayuki-senpai? I don't think today is my lucky day, so how about we postpone this until a later time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After coming all this way? I don't think that this has anything to do with luck, either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so nervous? This isn't a marriage interview, you know." "Marriage?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, but imagining Keiki-kun saying 'Please give me your daughter Sayuki' in front of my parents gets me pretty excited, I have to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the following words would be 'As my pet', right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I was hoping for." "I figured…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't have any interest in getting a girl as a pet. Of course, he had no plans whatsoever of saying that to Sayuki's parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on. Just standing here won't do us any good, so let's enter." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, having my owner visit me in my pen really makes my heart beat faster."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll go home after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow managing to suppress his urge to run away, Keiki unsteadily followed Sayuki inside her house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm back!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry for intruding…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki stepped inside, he heard footsteps coming from farther inside the house, and a beauty clad in tradtional Japanese garb appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, my. Welcome, Kiryuu-kun." "H-Hello… Thanks for having me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With long, glossy black hair hanging down her back, the woman Mifuyu greeted Keiki with a smile. She was wearing a red yukata.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seeing Sayuki-chan bringing a boy home makes your mother really happy." "You were the one who told me to bring him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, don't sweat the details."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, you're just the same as always…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of Mifuyu's young appearance, the two of them looked more like sisters than mother and daughter. Because of the difference in chest size, Sayuki looked like the older sister, too, which also added to the confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki watched the exchange between the two of them, Mifuyu brought some guest slippers for Keiki to wear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me guide you to the room."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, Keiki ended up trotting after the very pleased Mifuyu and Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the residence looked rather old from the outside, the inside was a normal, western-style house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This house's inside and outside are quite different, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though the building is old, we've renovated the interior. Sayuki-chan's room is also western-style."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Mifuyu was showing off their home's interior, Sayuki added a side comment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The guest rooms and my father's working space are Japanese-styled, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Then is your father at home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think so, but he probably won't come out. My father is quite bad with people, you see, so he always shuts himself in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's quite different from what I had imagined…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As they talked, they arrived at the aforementioned guest room. Just as one would expect, it had a low table with floor cushions for guests.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go put on some tea, so please wait a bit." "Ah, don't mind me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go change out of my school clothes, too." "Ah, okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing the other two off, Keiki put down his bag and sat on one floor cushion. He barely managed to sit in a seiza.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like they're welcoming me very warmly right now, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was constantly expecting them to bring up marriage talk, which prevented him from calming down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I can't let my guard down just yet…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as Keiki didn't have clarification that nothing had happened that night, the possibility of it coming up now wasn't zero. Keiki continued to sit there uneasily until the Tokihara mother and daughter returned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for waiting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki came back, wearing casual clothes, and Mifuyu arrived with a tray in hand shortly after. Keiki thought that Sayuki looked pretty cute, wearing her sweater and jeans. Mifuyu set the tray down next to her daughter. She was about to put the tea down on the table, but she gave a quick gasp of surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, how clumsy of me. I forgot to bring out any snacks. I'm sorry, Sayuki- chan, but could you go buy some really quick?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? It'll take me ten minutes even if I go to the closest convenience store."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about I make you pay for it with your allowance, then?" "I'll be right back, dear mother!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's attitude changed instantly. "Keiki-kun, I'll be right back, okay?" "…Eh? Wait, Senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After receiving some money from Mifuyu, Sayuki energetically stormed out of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There she goes."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Keiki was left alone in the spider's ne-in the room with Mifuyu.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't being left alone with Senpai's mother like standing in the middle of a battlefield?!</p>
<p class="null-p">While he felt a thrill he'd rather not experience, cold sweat started running down Keiki's forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, you seem to be sweating a bit. Are you okay? Weird. It's pretty nice out today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't mind me. I'm the type of person who sweats a lot." "Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sorry. That was a lie. My sweat won't stop because I'm so nervous right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But at least we can talk in peace this way." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, I always wanted to have a little talk with Kiryuu-kun." "…Was that why you sent Sayuki-senpai to buy some snacks?" "Fufu. It went just as planned."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't expect that from you, if I'm honest…"</p>
<p class="null-p">What could she possibly want to talk about that she didn't want her daughter to hear? Still wary of the whole marriage idea, Keiki twitched as Mifuyu opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I always wanted to thank you, Kiryuu-kun. It's all thanks to you that Sayuki- chan can now have a fun and enjoyable school life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Keiki's confused question, Mifuyu took out a photo album and showed it to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a picture from when she was a small child."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, cute… But all of these pictures are of her holding a brush…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had way smaller breasts than she did now, and she seemed to be in grade school, or even still in kindergarten. But every picture was of her sitting in front of calligraphy paper, a brush in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That girl was forced to learn calligraphy by her father, and she wasn't allowed to make friends, or even go out to play."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I think Senpai told me about that before…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her father belonged to a strict calligraphy household, so she was forced to follow in his footsteps from a young age, and was unable to make any friends up until middle school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But after she started going to high school, and joined the calligraphy club, she looked like she really enjoyed herself. She was surrounded by kind Senpais, and she even got Kouhais like Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">During her first year, she had the Senpais, and in her second year, she was together with Keiki. Now that she had become a third-year, even more members had joined the calligraphy club, making it rather lively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's always gushing to me about it. About how that first year girl is always acting cheeky, how she got scolded by a teacher after she got ink all over the room, how cute the reactions of her Kouhai are that she always teases.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything is club-related." "Senpai is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Getting scolded by the teacher, playing pranks on her Kouhai…</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it shouldn't be anything extraordinary, she was talking about it like it meant the world to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really surprised when she said that she was going on a training camp with everyone from the calligraphy club. At the same time, I was really happy. This was the first time she had ever invited someone somewhere. That just shows how much she treasures all of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, Sayuki didn't seem to be an outgoing kind of girl at all. Even so, she had done the planning for the training camp, thinking that it would be fine if it were for the members of the calligraphy club she treasured so much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that she had a crazy fight with Kiryuu-kun, though." "I'm very sorry for bothering you like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought back to when he had visited this house for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's all because of Kiryuu-kun that Sayuki-chan is so lively now. So thank you for staying with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mifuyu-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Today seemed to be the kind of day where he was being thanked a lot. Not to mention that it was from both mother and daughter alike.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please take care of her, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. I have a lot of fun when I'm together with her, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki replied with his honest feelings, Mifuyu returned a cheerful smile. Though he had been panicking a bit at the start, he was glad that he had been able to have this talk with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Kiryuu-kun." "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to be blunt. How far have you gone with Sayuki-chan?" "……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As her mother, I was wondering when I would be able to see the face of a grandchild, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Grandchild?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I could decide it for myself, then I'd want a boy and a girl." "No no no no?! Wait a moment?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The topic of the conversation, as well as the mood in the room, had taken a complete turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to have the wrong idea here. Sayuki-senpai and I aren't in that kind of relationship!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Kiryuu-kun, you've fondled Sayuki-chan's breasts before, right?" "That's a misunderstanding!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not once had Keiki done that in order to fulfill his own desires. When he put his hand in the valley of her chest, he did it to retrieve a key that had fallen there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Sayuki-chan is cute and her personality-or rather her sexuality-are a bit enticing, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, that's true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've always been worried that nobody would marry her." "Ah, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'd be able to rest easy if it was Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the exact development that Keiki had feared. Mifuyu was totally serious about getting Keiki and Sayuki married.</p>
<p class="null-p">Marry… Sayuki-senpai?</p>
<p class="null-p">What would await him was a more-than-abnormal married couple life. Like the dream he had had before, he would have to take her on a walk. She would crawl on the ground next to him, wearing a collar around her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's not happening!!!</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wanted to experience normal love. This would be the exact opposite of that</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But Sayuki-senpai needs a hardcore sadist to satisfy her, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-chan has called you a promising future sadist, though." "I'm not a sadist!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara ara, you're sweating again." "I just sweat a lot! It's nothing!" "Here, use this if you want." "Ahh… Thank you very much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mifuyu took a pink handkerchief out of her kimono and handed it to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling a bit unpleasant with all this sweat, Keiki gratefully accepted it and opened it up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, the handkerchief in Keiki's hands made him doubt his eyes. No, the triangle-shaped pink object in his hands wasn't a handkerchief-</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a pair of panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, why are you giving me panties?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, my mistake. I accidentally handed you my panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of accident is that?! A-Anyway! Here! Take them back!" Venting some stress at Mifuyu, he handed her the panties back. "Why are you even carrying them around on you like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why not? What's wrong with loving panties so much that you always keep a pair on you at all times or something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that dubious phrase, Mifuyu took the panties back and started staring at them with a heated expression. She then started rubbing them against her cheeks in the very next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… This smooth fabric… And this lovable, perfectionistic design… Haaaah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mifuyu-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With an ecstatic expression on her face, the married woman panted heavily while showering the panties in her hands in her love. Keiki didn't know what to make of the situation in front of him. He could only stare at her blankly until Mifuyu finally returned to reality. She put one hand on her cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, what a blunder. I completely tripped out for a moment there." "How can you go on a trip with panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, Mifuyu-san has the hobby of gathering sexy underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're an underwear collector…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a whole variety back in my room. Want to see?" "I'll pass."</p>
<p class="null-p">What did she expect? Was she thinking that Keiki would actually accept that</p>
<p class="null-p">invitation?</p>
<p class="null-p">In any case, it was thus revealed that the mother of Keiki's hardcore masochistic Senpai was actually a panties-loving perverted Mama-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they chatted for a bit until Sayuki returned, and when Keiki checked the clock, it was already time for him to depart. When he stepped outside the entrance to the house with Sayuki, it had gotten pretty dark outside already, and a clear, starry sky had opened up above them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could've at least stayed for dinner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha already made some and is waiting at home with my share, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're as much of a siscon as always. I would expect nothing less from the man who wiped his face with a married woman's panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't do anything like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had realized it before he wiped his face, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I had no idea that Mifuyu-san had that kind of hobby…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mother has a habit of gathering all sorts of things. She has various other</p>
<p class="null-p">collections." "For example?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't really say it out loud, but she has a lot of those toys made to look like male genitalia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'll just pretend that I didn't hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She says that father will get jealous if she gathers all of that stuff." "What an unexpectedly cute reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, any husband would probably get jealous if they saw their wife playing with adult toys. Understanding that, she kept gathering them, in order to further induce his jealousy. She seemed to be quite the devilish woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, my parents are always lovey-dovey. They have nocturnal activities almost every night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, I really didn't want to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But seeing a married couple be this close is really wonderful. The fact that my father gets jealous like that is proof enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess you're right…" Love does take many forms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of nocturnal activities, I can't forget that night." "That night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The night of the party." "Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot had happened, so it had completely slipped his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, just remembering it gives me the shivers! Keiki-kun, you were so good that I might just get addicted!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what am I good at?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're fine with it, we can do it again in my room." "Do what again, exactly?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spanking, of course." "…Excuse me?" Spanking?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard that word, Keiki's mind suddenly entered flashback mode, and he remembered the incident on that night.</p>
<p class="null-p">The culture festival had ended, and the members of the calligraphy club held a celebration party that evening. Having gotten a good amount of alcohol intake thanks to the pound cake and Yuika's 'totally normal' juice, Keiki staggered back to his room. Even without any electricity, the room was illuminated by the moonlight entering through the window. He set down the empty can he had taken into his room in his drunken stupor. He was about to take a good nap, when he heard a sudden knock on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who is it?" "It's me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The door opened, and Sayuki stood in the doorframe. However, the only thing she was wearing was a white shirt. She must've lost her skirt somewhere along the way, and Keiki could catch glimpses of her pink underwear from time to time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, what a wonderful appearance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm honored to receive such praise."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the influence of alcohol, their conversation was quite offbeat, but there was no one else present who could comment on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what business might you have that you're visiting me this late?" "Ah, yes. I have a request for Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I ended up getting fired from my job, but I worked hard and made the maid cafe a success, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right about that. You really saved us." "So… I'd like my reward now."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying these words, Sayuki put both her hands on the desk, and seductively pushed her butt towards Keiki. As a result, Keiki now had a great view of her pink panties. Even in the dark room, her white skin was as radiant as ever.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_22.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Exactly what kind of reward do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You already know… Don't tease me! Hurry it up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do. If you don't tell me, I won't give you any reward." "Uuu… Keiki-kun is such a teaser."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that makes you pretty happy, right?" "T-That's not…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, use that indecent mouth of yours to tell me exactly what you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl pursed her lips for a moment, only for her to give in and scream it out loud.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please! Spank me! Spank my unnecessarily huge butt with as much force as you can!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My pleasure!" "Ahhnnn?! So rough?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">…That's about how it went down. "So that's what happened…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, that spanking really felt good. I was very satisfied, for my part." All Keiki had done that night was give the girl a good spanking.</p>
<p class="null-p">That reminds me, I did promise to spank her butt when she managed to pay back the debt.</p>
<p class="null-p">To make sure that his lazy upperclassman would find the motivation to find a</p>
<p class="null-p">job and pay back the debt, he promised her this reward as bait.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that's what Yuika-chan saw…</p>
<p class="null-p">That explained her 'Butts aren't made for that!' comment from before. But she hadn't seen enough to fully understand the situation. And when Sayuki was satisfied, she fell asleep right then and there on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank God… So I didn't lose anything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing had happened with Sayuki on that night. No tragedy that he would regret forever. He hadn't lost his virginity. He had even averted a forced marriage with the Tokihara clan. Keiki left their residence behind him with a pleasant, refreshed feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 5:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the following day after Keiki had visited the Tokihara residence. It was a Thursday, and classes had ended.</p>
<p class="null-p">After making his way to the clubroom, he was greeted by Mao, who was flashing an evil smile as she drew in her sketchbook. She was sitting at the table inside the room. Of course, it was easy to guess what she was working on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you working on a new BL manga again?" "Heh, a masterpiece, if I do say so myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… Keeki-kun is with another man, not Shouto…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, Keeki wasn't embracing the all-too familiar Shouto, but a beautiful boy with a girly face. Of course, that character bore a perfect resemblance to Rintarou…</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, you found out about Mitani being a boy…" "I cannot thank the gods enough for this blessing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the character's name is 'Rinnosuke', huh?" "Such an elegant name, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you just stop using guys you know as your models in the first place, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, the setting for the story was that Rinnosuke was trying to get Keeki to join an understaffed student council, forcing him away from Shouto.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This some high-level NTR stuff, isn't it?" "Eh? Is there a problem with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you acting like this isn't a problem?" "Well, Shouto gets his chance later, so it's all good." "My head is starting to hurt…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki really would have liked to pass on seeing a character modeled after him being ravaged like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see that Keeki is on the receiving end, as always…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that Keeki shines more brightly like this. Don't you think that Keeki being hammered by a young Kouhai while keeping it a secret from Shouto is the best thing ever?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I actually don't, no."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't care less about some three-way fictional relationship drama that only involved boys.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, and I'd like some advice from Kiryuu." "Advice on what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I said that I needed it for reference, would you be willing to show me your</p>
<p class="null-p">d*ck?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch, even though you showed Mizuha." "I didn't show her. I was seen!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That had been an unfortunate accident involving a bath towel that didn't stay in place. Keiki wasn't the kind of person who found pleasure in showing off his naked body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Nanjou… You're the only girl I know who would straight-up ask me something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about club prez?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, she does seem like she would, but she never has."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing as how she was a female molester, the chances weren't that slim.</p>
<p class="null-p">But before they could delve deeper into that topic, a knock on the door stopped their conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? I wonder who that is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The calligraphy club almost never had visitors. Keiki made eye contact with Mao, and the girl hid all the evidence of her BL nature. Keiki opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai…" "Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, the girl was fidgeting with flushed cheeks. She looked up at</p>
<p class="null-p">him with a somewhat expectant expression. "Umm… Senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of this confession-like atmosphere, Airi said the following. "Please, Senpai-Show me your d*ick!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_23.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, there was more than one girl Keiki knew who was the kind of person who would ask to see his genitals.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: For Airi, the unknown men's world</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 1:</p>
<p class="null-p">The day before Nagase Airi had gone to ask Kiryuu Keiki that inappropriate question.</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes had ended, the student council members were holding a tea party inside the student council office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayano-chan, your homemade cookies are really delicious." "I'm happy to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a shame for Keikun-senpai. If he had stayed in the student council, he would've been able to eat Ayanon-senpai's delicious sweets all the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, it's one hundred years to early for Kiryuu-senpai to deserve Fujimoto-senpai's cookies."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho, Ayano, Rin (dressed like a girl), and Airi were sitting around the table, happily enjoying some tea and sweets as they talked with each other. Every time they managed to get through a big event, they would always drink tea in celebration and talk about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that the culture festival is done, we can take it easy for a while, Airi thought as she munged on a cookie.</p>
<p class="null-p">But since they were all super-busy student council members, life didn't always turn out that way-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. Next week, the board chairman is going to be inspecting the school, so they asked me to get someone from the student council to show him around."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho brought up a new job for them to do. Rin was the first one to respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Board chairman… That's the muscly man with the tight suit, right? With the dandy moustache?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, yeah, that's the one."</p>
<p class="null-p">The board chairman was a middle-aged man, and he seemed to have focused on muscle training. He had visited the school countless times already, and every time, a single student council member would be assigned to show him around. Apparently, it was a very important job to keep up a conversation with the chairman as you showed him around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that case, I'd like to ask Airi-chan to do it this time." "………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi clearly didn't expect to be chosen by the student council president. As Shiho should know already, Airi really despised men. Or, to phrase it a bit more accurately, she had problems dealing with them. That was why she had never had that role up until now…</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But Shiho-senpai? The board chairman is a man, so it'd be pretty bad if I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi-chan, I heard that your attitude toward male customers wasn't exactly ideal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was true. When she had been on duty as the receptionist for the haunted house, the male guests frequently commented about her rude attitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't help it if you're bad with men, but as a member of the student council, I think it would be good if you were at least are able to hold a normal</p>
<p class="null-p">conversation with one." "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So with that being said, I'll leave the job of escorting the board chairman around to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yes, I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was a member of the student council. She was very well aware that treating boys and girls differently wasn't a good trait to have. Since Shiho was completely correct with her logic, Airi didn't have it in her to try to refuse, so she accepted her newfound duty.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 2:</p>
<p class="null-p">"…And that's how I ended up being responsible for showing the board chairman around."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was around ten minutes after Airi's verbal sexual harassment. After that, Keiki and the girl moved to an empty classroom and sat at a table across from each other while Airi finished describing the circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So this is your first time showing him around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But whenever I'm trying to talk to a boy, I always end up putting on an overbearing attitude. I'm worried that I might end up doing something similar with the board chairman. I don't really have any confidence that I can do this job properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're in quite the predicament, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi acting rude to boys was a daily occurence. That was why that boy back at the sports festival had gotten mad at her. For her, showing the board chairman of all people around was quite the high hurdle. If she treated the chairman poorly, it could very well come back to bite the student council as a whole.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though she told me to get used to men, I have no idea what I</p>
<p class="null-p">specifically have to do in order to achieve that…" "So that's why you came to ask me for advice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hatred of men had originated from a traumatic experience she had back in grade school. When she was a fourth-grader, Airi had seen a boy in her class licking the mouthpiece of her flute. With that in mind, one could definitely understand that this was the trigger that caused her to dive into the world of yuri.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get where you're coming from, but why would you suddenly ask me to show you my genitals?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I researched it a bit with my smartphone, I found something that said 'To understand men, you have to start from their lower half'…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You definitely picked the wrong website to believe, there." "I wanted to die when I realized what I had said."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's eyes looked into the distance as she thought back to her blunder. The site she had used for reference probably had to do with love and relationship advice, and was aimed at adults. Since she still hadn't realized that even after her mistake, it just showed how much her current situation troubled her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's impossible, wouldn't it just be better to let someone else take over for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I wanted to do from the start, but Shiho-senpai told me no." "It seems like she can be strict when she wants to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, she was more of a kind Onee-san type of person, but as soon as she entered student council president mode, her jovial smile could disappear quite quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, when is the board chairman coming to visit?" "Next week on Thursday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you have about one week left… That's not much time to work with."</p>
<p class="null-p">They wouldn't be able to cure her hatred of men by then. Although Keiki wished they could at least improve it some by then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to change. I don't want to trouble everyone from the student council just because of my ineptitude, and I want to be able to talk to other boys."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please! I can only ask Kiryuu-senpai for help with this! Teach me how to talk to boys!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hatred of men ran quite deep. But he had been in her care during his time in the student council. Though it was just for a short amount of time, it was a request from a cute Kouhai whom he had once worked together with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it'd be better to fix it now than never." "…! Thank you very much!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the former temporary student council member Keiki decided to help grant Airi's wish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 3:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the following day during lunch break. The location was the same empty classroom as the day before. Keiki and Airi were sitting at the same table, facing each other once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right. I'd like to start the special training to make Airi more comfortable around men."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm in your care."</p>
<p class="null-p">In order for Airi to be able to perform her student council work, they had decided to hold this special training during lunch break. Since the odds of</p>
<p class="null-p">someone interrupting them were fairly low, they could focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our goal should be to make you able to hold a normal conversation with a man, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's correct. Whenever I'm with a man, I can't help but be wary of them, talk offensively, and even lose my temper, and I'd like to change that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're pretty much used to me and Rintarou now, but your tongue gets pretty sharp when it's another boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… I really want to fix that, you know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi sighed at Keiki's merciless observation. Back during the sports festival, Keiki had advised her to work on that bad habit, but she wouldn't be in this much trouble if that were that easy. Even more so since the reason for that was childhood trauma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, rushing things won't do us any good, so let's take a steady pace." "Yes, I'll do my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi gave an earnest nod. After Keiki confirmed her feelings, he officially started the special training.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's have you practice talking with a boy," Keiki said. He took out a single CD from a plastic bag. Shown on the cover was an illustration of a handsome ikemen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is called a 'Boys CD.' It's an audio track of several ikemen talking to the listener."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where do they sell these things?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't ask me how I got my hands on it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The individual whom Keiki didn't want to name had bought it as material for writing a high-quality BL manga, and she had lent it to Keiki after he asked her for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For the next five minutes, I'd like Nagase-san to try and have a conversation with these ikemen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And will that actually have some sort of effect?" "We'll give it an honest try."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe I asked the wrong person for help…" "Alright then, I'll start the recording~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki inserted the CD into the CD player he had borrowed from the music room. When he pressed the start button, there was a brief moment of silence before the voices came in.</p>
<p class="null-p">「Hey there, so you finally decided to come by, huh? I'll have you make up the time you cost me with a kiss, okay?」</p>
<p class="null-p">「No matter how much I've looked throughout the entire world, I've never seen a girl as cute as you.」</p>
<p class="null-p">「Now now, what's with that dark expression? You don't have to hold back in front of me, you know.」</p>
<p class="null-p">「Come here already. Even if the gods were against us, I would never leave you alone.」</p>
<p class="null-p">The CD player played each of their cool-sounding voices, and the phrases they were saying became more and more pretentious. With all these ikemen boys closing in on her, Airi for her part-</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of punishment is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a deadpan expression, Airi spoke her true feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, cut!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not being able to watch any longer, the self-proclaimed director pushed the pause button.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Nagase-san? This won't be good practice if you just keep quiet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you tell me that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you can't even open your mouth to talk to these fictional ikemen, there's no way you'll be able to hold a proper conversation with the real deal. Who was the one that wanted to be able to talk with boys normally?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I understand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's try this one more time, okay? Take two, here we go!" Director Keiki once again pushed the play button.</p>
<p class="null-p">「Why are you so beautiful?」</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know."</p>
<p class="null-p">「You say that, but you're totally interested in me, right?」"I'm not."</p>
<p class="null-p">「Hey hey, how about we grab a bite after this?」"I'll decline even if it kills me."</p>
<p class="null-p">「There's no need to sulk like that. Just show it to me. Your cute but embarrassing smile.」</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please just die."</p>
<p class="null-p">Around five minutes had passed. Keiki had hoped that this practice would at least have some sort of positive result, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's way too sharp-tongued…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's reactions to the ikemens' approaches were way too harsh. So much so that Keiki actually started to feel bad for them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you keep that up, you'll probably make the board chairman cry, you know? Men can be unexpectedly delicate, so being insulted like this by a girl can leave quite a scar."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… But just hearing a man's voice makes me go into defensive mode…" "Hmm… So it's already no good even with just the voices, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki's eyes seemed to be looking at her with pity, he hadn't exactly expected this to cause dramatic improvement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I was the one who said we should take it slow, so maybe I started out at a too high of a hurdle. If it's too tough on you, we can just wrap it up here for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Airi's head shot upright.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No! I won't be beaten by something like this! Please continue the special training!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well said! Then I'll stop holding back!" "Bring it on!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes after Keiki's Kouhai had showed such admirable determination-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Umm, Kiryuu-senpai?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said to bring it on, but don't you think that this is taking it a bit too far?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was currently resting on Keiki's lap while she complained. Keiki himself was sitting on a chair. Airi was simply sitting there calmly and quietly, using her Senpai's lap as a seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you can get used to this distance, you shouldn't be as nervous when men are at a normal distance, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be the case, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, your face is stiffening up again. Always smile while you're holding a conversation. Never forget that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You devilish instructor!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi forced a smile on her face, while still continuing to insult Keiki. This was special training to make sure that she could smile no matter the circumstance while talking to a boy, and thanks to a mirror he had put down on the table, Keiki could look over Airi's shoulder to check her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good, good. Your smile is still a bit stiff, but you're making good progress." "Ugh… You'll regret this later…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you'll get a penalty if you make any cheeky comments." "P-Penalty…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, heh, heh. I'm a devilish instructor right now. This bad girl, since she's not willing to learn, will receive head-patting as punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following his announcement, the devilish instructor put his hand on the girl's head and started rubbing it. Immediately after, Airi began complaining.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Kiryuu-senpai?! Don't you think that this is taking it too-" "This is another part of your special training."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's part of your special training."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… I understand… Why do I have to go through such disgrace?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face bright red, Airi unwillingly accepted her punishment. Now that she had steeled her resolve, all she could do was accept her instructor's orders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I can tell that you're working really hard." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first, you pretty much hated me like I was your archnemesis. You thought that I was a playboy, and it felt like you hated simply being near me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That really happened, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But right now, you're able to hold a conversation with me, right?" "Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After many twists and turns, they had arrived at their current relationship. After all the prejudice she had, Airi was now able to talk normally with her upperclassman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I don't think that you have to stress yourself out over it. I believe that one day you'll be able to talk normally with everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki believed that, if she really strove for it, that future would definitely come.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we can't really sit on our laurels since the board chairman is visiting in a few days, so we're better off thinking of a way we can train you quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi sighed in exasperation as she sat on Keiki's lap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better see this through with me until the very end, okay? Especially after making me go through something as embarrassing as this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wouldn't have decided to do this if he were the type of person who gave up midway. Since he had taken up this duty as an instructor, it was his job to take responsibility until the very end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's try the boys' CD in this situation again-" "Please, spare me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, after classes had ended, Keiki made his way towards the familiar calligraphy clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the first person here, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had gotten the key from Sayuki, who would be running late today. Keiki opened the door using the key and headed inside. After putting his bag down, he opened the windows to let in some fresh air and sat down in a nearby chair. Without anything better to do, Keiki found himself just gazing out the window. A big yawn escaped his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a bit sleepy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been busy with preparations for Airi's special training, so he hadn't been able to catch much sleep the night prior. Though he had barely managed to not fall asleep in class, he would probably reach his limit soon, and he was certain that he would quickly enter the land of dreams if he shut his eyes right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…A little bit should be fine, right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, he lost against the temptations of the sandman, and he closed his eyes. He had completely forgotten that this place was a perverts' den.</p>
<p class="null-p">……</p>
<p class="null-p">……</p>
<p class="null-p">……</p>
<p class="null-p">……Clatter clatter. Rattle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's slumbering consciousness slowly returned when he heard a metallic sound. When he opened his eyes, he immediately spotted a blonde-haired beauty standing next to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you're awake?" "Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was his angelically-cute Kouhai. But Keiki's gaze didn't focus on her smile, but rather on her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan… What's that thing you have in your hands there? String? Rope?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a leash. It's the sort of thing you use when you want to take your doggie out for a walk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">You wouldn't normally bring a dog's leash to school like that. And for some reason, the other end of that leash wound its way towards Keiki…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately expecting the worst-case scenario, Keiki put on hand on his neck. And, as expected, there was a collar there. It was connected to the leash in Yuika's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you put a collar on me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Keiki-senpai was sleeping so soundly, Yuika just happened to put it</p>
<p class="null-p">on you~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so you tripped and put it on me accidentally?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that Keiki clearly hadn't accepted the situation, Yuika puffed out her cheeks in displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you think that you've been a bit too rebellious as of recently, Keiki- senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rebellious…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"During our midterms, you put a blindfold on Yuika and played with her feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you were playing with Witch-senpai on the night of our party." "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And to finish it off, this-!" Yuika showed him her smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown on the screen was definitive proof. Proof in the form of a picture of what had happened a few hours ago. The picture was of defendant Kiryuu Keiki with a twintails girl sitting on his lap inside of an empty classroom. He was gently stroking Airi's head in the picture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't you say that there was nothing going on between you and Airi?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He did.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the calligraphy club members had expressed doubt about Keiki's relationship with Airi, he had declared that there was nothing to be doubtful about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said that, but you look rather friendly in this picture, don't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no room for Keiki to dispute. Not to mention that, though her face was forming a smile, Yuika's eyes scared Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you think that disciplining you would be fair here, Keiki-senpai?" "W-Wait a second! Calm down! Hear me out first!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have the right to remain silent." "I'm guilty already?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, Keiki-senpai will be Yuika's dog from now on. Could she ask you to start crawling on all fours immediately?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, umm, that's a bit…" "Ohh? This is stringe." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Senpai is a dog right now, you should be acting like one, and only responding with 'Woof'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyyyyiii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It had been a while since Yuika's eyes burned with madness like this. Her eyes were the same as when she had stuffed her freshly-worn panties into Keiki's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I don't obey her… I'll be forced to chew on some panties again…!</p>
<p class="null-p">That horrifying scene came to the surface of the slave's mind again. At the same time, an incredibly strong desire to live sprouted inside him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will only say it one more time, okay? Behave like a dog would, and get down on your fours."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woof!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no more pride left. His survival instincts kicked in and Keiki did as he was told.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aha, how good of you to actually listen to your master's orders. Since Senpai is such a clever boy, Yuika will step on you as a reward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woof?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When his Kouhai stepped on his face, a scream escaped Keiki's lips. Yuika's foot, wrapped in a sock, mercilessly came down on the back of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Granted, she had taken off her shoes before she started this torture, so she was showing some restraint, at least.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, this feels great! Yuika's in a good mood, so she'll step on you a bit more, okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Wooof, wuff, wuff!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With the leash in her hand, the queen started doing whatever she wanted. The dog couldn't hold back his yelps of pain as Yuika's foot dug deeper and deeper into his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this atmosphere that could very well be described as pure chaos with Keiki suffering more and more, the door of the clubroom opened, and a black- haired upperclassman appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki froze with her bag in hand, staring at the scene in front of her. "Sayuki-senpai?! Help me-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you two having fun by yourselves like that?! Let me in on it!" "Sayuki-senpaaaaaai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when he thought that a goddess had appeared to save him, she turned out</p>
<p class="null-p">to be a comrade of the devil. Of course, Keiki was put through the wringer after that because of those perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 4:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the beginning of a new week. Specifically, it was lunch break on Monday.</p>
<p class="null-p">The visit of the board chairman was approaching quickly. Airi's feet moved slowly as she dragged herself into the empty classroom, prepared for another special training.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you're here, Nagase-san." "I-I'm here, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason that Airi's wariness had gone up tenfold was because there were two other boys together with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">One was the ikemen ace of the tennis club, Akiyama Shouma. The other one was the beautiful boy Mitani Rin, whose pants didn't suit his girly appearance at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You might already know him, but this guy here is Akiyama Shouma. He's an unfortunate ikemen whose taste in women hasn't grown with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, I'm Akiyama. Small girls are my type." "So you're a lolicon…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's eyes went cold immediately when she heard Shouma's self- introduction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, a fellow colleague of yours, the student council secretary Mitani Rin." "Heyho, Rin-chan here~ I'm your co worker in the student council~" "You're just a crossdressing bastard…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And when Rintarou gave his self-introduction, her eyes made it look like she was looking at human garbage. But Keiki hadn't called her here in order to torture her with the lolicon and crossdresser one-two pervert combo.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to have these two help out with your special training today." "And just what would that be…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was concerned and it hadn't even started yet. Maybe her instincts were telling her something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, could you turn your back to us and close your eyes?" "I'm getting an even worse feeling from this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is one part of your training."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you think that you're forcing too much on me just because it's special training?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Spitting out complaints, Airi still did as she was told, and closed her eyes. After Keiki made sure of that, he called out to the other two boys.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. Everyone, let's get this party started!" "Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After their leader gave the order, the other two boys started taking off their clothes. Needless to say, Keiki also did so. He hung the blazer on a nearby chair, and set his shirt, socks, and even his pants on top. In the presence of a girl, the three boys stripped in a carefree manner. It was quite an unusual sight. When their preparations were done, instructor Kiryuu called out to his student.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, you can turn around now." "Ah, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After opening her eyes, Airi slowly turned around. As soon as she caught</p>
<p class="null-p">sight of the scene in front of her, she shrieked as if she had met a molester in a packed train. Of course, that reaction was perfectly normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">What she saw was Keiki and the others lined up next to each other, wearing nothing but swimming trunks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?! W-What kind of clothes are you wearing in front of a girl?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to confuse you like that, but this isn't underwear. They're normal swimming trunks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, I still don't understand the reason for you to wear swimsuits inside a classroom!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you manage to have a normal conversation with the three of us clothed like this, you'll surely be able to have a normal conversation with the board chairman, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rin carefully watched Airi's reaction before he gave a comment himself. "Nagase-san really is cute. Panicking because of swimsuits like this~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, right? Though she can't win against my Koharu-chan, she's still pretty cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Akiyama-senpai has a girlfriend? I'm so envious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's a year older than me, but she's like a grade schooler and she's cute legal loli."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you sure that she's not actually a loli?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou just stared at the lolicon after that declaration, but Keiki ignored both of them for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, Nagase-san, you'll have to spend some jolly-friendly time with us today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sounds less like punishment and more like torture, actually?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Airi, who was bad at dealing with men, being surrounded by half-naked boys like this in a classroom must be hell. Her expression definitely showed her honest feelings as well, but this was all for her special training. Airi was aiming to have a normal conversation with boys. This was all so that she wouldn't make any trouble for anyone else while performing her duties for the student council. Just talking with Keiki, whom she had known for a while now, wouldn't help her much in this regard.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that in mind, Keiki had asked Shouma and Rintarou for help. He wanted to help Airi be able to hold a calm, relaxing conversation with other boys aside from him. Communication training, so to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Akiyama-senpai and Mitani, didn't you have any doubts about all of this?" Airi asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if my friend's asking for it, I can't really say no. He said that it's for a cute Kouhai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was always interested in Nagase-san, as well. We're fellow members of the student council, after all, so I want to help where I can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi pondered for a moment after they gave their answers. "…Please lend me your strength."</p>
<p class="null-p">She spoke her true feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, since that's over, let's start playing some cards!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following instructor Kiryuu's orders, the four of them sat around a nearby table and started a game of old maid. First was Keiki, and then rotating clockwise, Airi, Rintarou, and Shouma. Of course, the boys were still wearing their swimming trunks, and Airi's muttered a weak "I feel like I'm going crazy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After thoroughly shuffling them, they passed out the cards and set down the pairs they had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we're playing old maid, how about we spice things up by adding a punishment for the loser?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that sounds good. What do you think is good, Mitani?" "Hmm… How about we make the loser take off one piece of clothing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not even in your dreams. Also, you all would end up completely naked with just one loss."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_24.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Just as Airi had said, one loss for the boys would mean exposing everything. "Also, that punishment is taking it a bit too far, Mitani."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahah, men are all like that, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou, leave it at that. Nagase-san will end up hating men even more than before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, how about we have the loser make a weird face in front of everyone else?" Shouma suggested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not much better…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, they decided on Shouma's idea, and their game of old maid started.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, Airi kept her distance and was wary of the swimming-trunks-clad boys, but she soon became serious, probably not wanting to get the punishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the game moved on. "Alright, I'm out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma was the first to get rid of all the cards in his hand. "Ah, I'm done as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was shortly followed by Rintarou. "Ugh… Why can't I win?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because your emotions are clearly showing in your face, Nagase-san." "Talk down to me after you've actually won!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bring it on. I'm looking forward to Nagase-san's punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had only a 3 of hearts left while Airi was still holding two cards, which meant that the joker was one of them. If Keiki managed to get the pair, he would be able to enjoy Airi's weird expression as her punishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, which one of these is it, I wonder?" First, his hand hovered over the right card. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, he quickly moved his hand above the card on the left. "!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just for a fraction of a second, but Keiki didn't miss the girl's expression slightly changing. Airi had such a straightforward personality that it made sense that she didn't have a good poker face. It was a shame, but such was the world of competition. Not fearing the blood and tears that would be shed, the demon instructor slowly reached towards the card on the left.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Umm… Kiryuu-senpai? That is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuahahahahaha! You can start thinking of the weird face you'll be pulling in front of us in a second!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nooooooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the exact moment that the hand of the devil touched the crying Airi's leftmost card-</p>
<p class="null-p">"You people… What in the world are you doing here?" "Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were spotted by Okita-sensei as she passed by.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_25.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"…Really, did you think about this twice? I get the general gist of it, but don't act like idiots on school grounds. And you boys, hurry up and put on some clothes already."</p>
<p class="null-p">After having the boys kneel down on the floor, Okita-sensei spoke to them with a disgusted tone of voice. After she left the classroom, the boys slowly stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that almost turned into a lot of trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've had to get on my knees while being scolded like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the same for me, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">While the three boys were voicing their complaints, "……Pfft."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi, who had been watching the whole time, let out a giggle. "Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fu… Fufu… Hahaha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably had found the scene of the three of them being lectured while in swimming trunks a bit too ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being forced to sit on the ground while you're being lectured… Fufu… How idiotic can you be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they saw Airi's smile, the boys also broke into grins. It meant that them stripping like that had been worth it. Their goal for the day was accomplished in the best way possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 5:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Tuesday after classes ended. After borrowing a book from the library, Keiki was now heading towards the entrance of the school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Near the lobby, Keiki saw a boy and a girl talking with each other. "Nagase-san?…And a first year boy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi and two male students were having a conversation in front of a vending machine. The boys had their hair up and were giving off a mischievous atmosphere. They seemed to be in some kind of dispute with Nagase.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's your business?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hid in the shadow of a nearby shoe rack and watched the scene unfold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that we were the ones at fault, since we were playing catch with an empty can, but you didn't have to say that much, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the spiky-haired tall boy say that,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our hearts are unexpectedly frail. They're a bit like glass, you know?" The smaller boy claimed,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, that's funny coming from you, since you're busy looking so flashy." Airi spit out that provocative phrase.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is Nagase-san saying too much again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just from that exchange, Keiki had mostly grasped the situation. Apparently, Airi was warning the boys, but her way of phrasing it had gone too far again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Tch, it's okay. Really, Nagase isn't cute at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? Her personality is such a pain. I can't be bothered playing along with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them left the place, still complaining about Airi. Of course, their conversation was loud enough for Airi to hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………I know that… that I'm not cute at all…" Airi said, wiping her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even from that distance, Keiki could clearly see that her shoulders were shaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm done with this… Why can't I just do it right…?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki found himself unable to call out to her. He didn't know what words he could cheer her up with.</p>
<p class="null-p">Later that day, Keiki holed himself up in his room after eating dinner. He started working on his plan with the book he had borrowed and a laptop. Behind him was Mizuha, lying sprawled out on his bed, reading one of his manga. If she didn't have anything to do, she would often laze around in Keiki's room like that. It was a wonderful personality trait of hers to never bother her older brother when he was busy.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Keiki noticed that it had gotten a bit too quiet- "Ah… Mizuha fell asleep again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Falling asleep on her brother's bed wasn't all that rare for her, either. "My little sister is as careless as ever…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked up at the clock, he saw the time had already passed 11pm. Deciding to take a break, Keiki got up from his seat and sat down on the bed. He poked his lovable little sister's cheeks. For a siscon like him, this sort of thing would always restore his energy and heal his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuunnn… Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, she's calling for me in my sleep. What kind of dream is she having, I wonder?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm embarrassed… Nii-san… can you strip as well…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait… Seriously, what kind of dream are you having?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Very dangerous vocabulary expected his sleeping step-sister's mouth. Mizuha's cheeks suddenly started to turn a vivid red color and she started fidgeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… Nii-san… Amazing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">…What is? What exactly is amazing?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hauu… You can't… if you go that far… I'll die from embarrassment…" "Stooooooop!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No more of that. Keiki's loud scream pulled his little sister back to reality, and she slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm? ….Ah? Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning. I heard you saying some very intriguing words during your sleep talk. What exactly were you dreaming about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After sitting upright a bit, Mizuha's face turned bright red. After hesitating a bit, she slowly confessed the contents of said dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… That was… It was a dream where Nii-san was stripping the clothes off of me… Outside…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's even crazier than I expected…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was starting to seriously worry about his little sister's future. "Come on. If you're gonna sleep, then do it in your own room." "Okaaaay," responded Mizuha, still half asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">After getting down from the bed, she turned around one last time before she</p>
<p class="null-p">stepped out of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san. Don't force yourself too much, either, okay?" "Will do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then good night." "Yeah, good night."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha stepped outside, all the while wearing a relaxed smile that Keiki loved to see. After seeing her off, Keiki got up from the bed and rested a couple of fingers on the laptop on top of his desk while he thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to work as hard as I can…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's crying face that he had seen that day after classes came to his mind. The girl had mentioned before that boys were like aliens to her, which made it impossible for her to read their thoughts. She probably unconsciously thought that boys were scary because of her childhood drama. The reason she was bad with them probably was a result of how difficult it was for her to deal with them. She was just scared and wary. She dished out insults and cold glares as a self-defense mechanism. Afterwards, she would always regret hurting the other party, and end up hurting herself. It was a vicious cycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'll have to wrack my brain about it a bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be difficult to completely cure Airi's trauma. Even so, Keiki thought that he at least wanted to help out as much as he could so that she wouldn't have to suffer any longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 6:</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the day before the board chairman was due to arrive. During lunch break, Airi was alone in the school building, walking through the hallways with a clouded expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… It's finally time tomorrow… I made some boys mad again just yesterday… Will I really be okay?" Airi muttered to herself as she thought</p>
<p class="null-p">about her mistake the day prior.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she had gotten help from Keiki, there were no obvious results after his rigorous training, and that made her even more nervous than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention the half-naked old maid game…</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'd be great if he didn't come up with something weird again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometimes her upperclassman had the weirdest ideas, or at least so she thought. While hoping that he hadn't prepared something that would top the swimming trunks old maid game, she slowly entered the empty classroom. When she did, she immediately spotted the person in question, sitting on a chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was indeed there, but he gave no response even when she called out to him. The reason for that became apparent when she moved to take a closer look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's totally sleeping…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was resting his body on the table, sound asleep with a smile on his face. "Really… Tomorrow's the day, so why is he……… Ah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A notebook entered Airi's field of view-</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Nagase-san's training diary'… What's that about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to ignore the title, Airi picked up the notebook and opened it. "This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Written inside were all kinds of plans and countermeasures that Keiki had thought up to try to cure Airi's hatred for men. All kinds of special training courses, their results, and Airi's reaction to every single one of them. On top</p>
<p class="null-p">of that, near the bottom of the page, Keiki had written down plans that he thought of after taking everything into consideration. It was titled 'Board chairman countermeasures'.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Since just telling her to relax doesn't seem to work, it seems more effective to try to create a relaxed atmosphere.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'Maybe it'd be worth it to try to make her think of the other person as a pumpkin.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'How about thinking about something she likes, so that her consciousness isn't focused on the man in front of her. Maybe some yuri fantasies would work wonders for Nagase-san?'</p>
<p class="null-p">'If she gets too nervous to look the other person in the eye, focusing on the eyebrow sounds like a good idea.'</p>
<p class="null-p">'If nothing else works, imagining the boy in swimming trunks might be a plausible last resort.'</p>
<p class="null-p">And so on.</p>
<p class="null-p">One page was completely filled with all the possible countermeasures. There were signs that he had rewritten them countless times. And that wasn't all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside Keiki's bag, Airi spotted various other books, titled things like 'How to cure your phobia of men' and 'Communication tips 101' and 'How to build positive relationships with other people' and so forth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He did all that… just for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't have written all that just since he had gotten here. Instead, Airi guessed that he had probably lost a huge amount of sleep thinking about all of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, this person is…"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_07_26.jpg">
<p class="null-p">It was the same back at the sports festival. When that cat stole her panties, he didn't rest until he got them back. Ignoring his own well-being, he had climbed a tree and hurt himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All this, and I'm his totally not-cute Kouhai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She always went on the offensive towards boys, she wasn't able to speak kindly to them, and she made every other boy mad after only a few seconds of talking. Even so, he had reached out his hand to help her. That was the kind of person he was, even if he wasn't aware of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe this is exactly what I'm lacking…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Up until now, she had only been concentrating on trying to not make men angry at her. But it never worked. Instead of just trying to not anger them, maybe she should think about how to make the other person happy. Like Keiki had done for Airi herself-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, we don't have much time, so wake up already. If you don't wake up, I'll pinch your nose."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuha?! …Eh, what? Nagase-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, it's time for some special training today!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ow! My nose, my nose! Let go, please?! That huuuuurts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">…Though this was something that she wouldn't be able to tell the person in question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi had become quite interested in this upperclassman of hers. Part 7:</p>
<p class="null-p">The week of training ended, and the day of reckoning arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to Kiryuu-senpai, I managed to show the board chairman around without incident."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the corner of the school building, after classes had ended, Airi sat across from Keiki in their usual empty classroom, a big smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad that nothing happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, there were countless times when I wanted to vent my anger towards him, but I managed to hold back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So we barely managed to get through this, huh?" When Keiki got to this point, he realized something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh. So how did you manage to pull through in the end?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I talked to the board chairman while imagining that I was talking to Kiryuu-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai is one of the few boys who I can talk to without being nervous. Imagining the board chairman as a pumpkin would be pretty impossible, so I imagined him being Kiryuu-senpai, and that helped me relax."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I hear some weird phrasing in there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, when I thought about Senpai wearing swimming trunks and being scolded by that Sensei, I couldn't help but smile, and that also helped with the tension."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like embarrassing myself like that ended up being worth it." "Well, it's not like my hatred of men is fixed now or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's one step in the right direction, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought that she had really worked hard. If she kept going like that, she would definitely be able to overcome her trauma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai, thank you very much for your help this time around. It's all thanks to you that I managed to fulfill my job properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. You helped me out a lot when I was a temporary student council member, so we can just call it even."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Senpai, you stopped helping the student council as soon as you repaid the debt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that was the deal, wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shiho-senpai and Ayano-senpai were really sad, you know. Ah, and Mitani too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what about you?" "Now, I wonder."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi gave a teasing giggle. Since she hadn't immediately denied it, though, Keiki held out hope that she felt the same as Shiho and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it might sound weird coming from me after I stopped already, aren't you a bit troubled now that I'm gone? You must still be busy, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're not all that troubled. We did everything with the four of us before, so it's not that big of a deal that Senpai is gone now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That makes sense, I guess…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki had guessed as much, he still felt a bit lonely after being told that so bluntly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… If you want, you can always drop by to say hello, you know? I'll even make you some tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her smile, as well as those rare words coming from her, completely robbed Keiki of words. After all, for Keiki this behavior was as abnormal as a natural</p>
<p class="null-p">disaster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san is finally… Acting affectionate?!" "I-I'm not acting affectionate at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She denied it, her face bright red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right, I guess I'll have to come visit the student council a bit more often."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't get carried away just because I was a bit kind! This is why men are…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw Airi acting like that, Keiki thought that her tsundere act was perfect for her.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Around the middle of November, on a certain day after classes had ended.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki made his way to the calligraphy clubroom, a banquet of insanity appeared in front of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, it's very well written if I do say so myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had written 'Treasuring the animal life forever' as her latest work. "Ahaha, I have to punish this bad prince a bit more~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was working on her unethical picture book,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kufu… Fu fu fu fu fu fu fu. What a wonderful theme! This beautiful girly- looking Kouhai approaches him, and Keeki suddenly becomes aware of him even though he's a man! Normally I would've been happy with the usual shortcake theme, but a younger boy has even more charm than Shouto.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhhh, this is perfect…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she now had new material for the 'Mitani x Kiryuu' series, the fujoshi Mao was furiously working on a new manuscript.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would I be able to make Nii-san excited if I took one from this angle?" Mizuha was taking selfies for her own personal research.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was how things were now.</p>
<p class="null-p">The calligraphy club's perverts had gotten even more active than they were</p>
<p class="null-p">before the threat of club disbandment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The time when Nagase-san was coming over on a regular basis was the calmest, I think…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Back when Nagase-san was doing inspections on moral behaviour, the club members had to hide their perversion, so this current scene almost made Keiki feel a bit nostalgic.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to move forward with my 'De-perversion' plan, but it feels like I have nothing left to try…</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past, he had come up with several countermeasures, but every plan ended in failure. However, if Keiki didn't manage to cure their perversions, Keiki wouldn't be able to get a girlfriend without the girls getting in the way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All I want is a cute girlfriend…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki sighed, yearning for a future with a girlfriend. He turned around, as if he wanted to run from this nightmare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara? Keiki-kun, where are you going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just remembered that I had some business to attend to, so I'll be going to the student council office."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Then I'll keep my body clean until my master returns, okay?" "I'll be going~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhnnn?! If you ignore me like that, Sayuki will get excited, you know?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What a weird thing to get excited about. But Keiki didn't bother responding to her. He just left the room behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The student council office was in the back of the hallway on the third floor of the classroom building. Feeling slightly nostalgic, Keiki knocked on the door, but even after waiting for a bit, there was no response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is anybody there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was weird for nobody to be in the student council office, especially after classes. When he put his hand on the doorknob, he realized that the door wasn't locked, so he decided to take a peek inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so you're here after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">A single female student was in the supposedly empty student council office. She had semi-long, wavy hair, her beautiful legs were wrapped in tights, and she was absolutely brimming with an Onee-san vibe. She was sitting on a chair with earphones in, furiously clicking away at the game console in her hands. It made sense that she hadn't heard the knock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, Takasaki-senpai loves to play games in her free time."</p>
<p class="null-p">This school's student council president was quite the gamer, it seemed. That was what she had said during her self-introduction on the first day he had started acting as a temporary member.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, she's really got quite the concentration there…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She hadn't even noticed his presence yet. Even talking in a normal voice didn't seem to work. Making sure that he didn't disturb her focus, he carefully stepped behind her to take a peek at the screen. Shown there was what seemed to be some kind of dragon boss and a lone female knight. When he looked at the HP gauge for the dragon, it seemed like battle was nearing its final stage. However, the dragon summoned the last of its strength and powered up, burning away at the HP of Shiho's character and her teammates.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… You… Obstinate…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gritting her teeth, Shiho tightened her grip on her console. And-after the knight barely managed to dodge the dragon's fire breath attack, she managed to land the final hit and strike down the boss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After winning the heated battle, Shiho made a victory pose with the game</p>
<p class="null-p">console in one hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… I finally defeated it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally free of the tension, Shiho took out her earphones and stretched- "…Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, she finally noticed the presence of the boy standing behind her. "K-Keiki-kun?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work, Takasaki-senpai." "Wai-Eh, since when?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just now. You were really into the game, huh?" "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to her Kouhai's comment, Shiho hurriedly hid the game console's screen with her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I wasn't slacking off or anything, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Playing a game isn't a crime, is it? Nobody would get mad if you took a small break."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But my pride and dignity as student council president is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was gone the moment you tried to hide the game console like a kid who was spotted doing something wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah! Don't tease your Senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho childishly complained and puffed out her cheeks. She might look perfect from the outside, but she had a familiar, easy-to-get-along-with attitude. That was probably the reason why the other council members looked up to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a blunder… I thought that I'd be safe since everyone went out." "You really like games, don't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Quite. I love the feeling of leveling my characters up to fight a tough boss, and that sense of accomplishment when I finally beat them… You know what I mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do indeed. I love playing games myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then when we got the time, how about we play a bit together?" "That sounds really fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Playing games alone to pass the time wasn't bad, but the more the merrier, or so the saying goes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why did you come to visit the student council, Keiki-kun?" "Oh yeah, I wanted to bring this over."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took a printout from his bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, so you've already filled them out. I'll check them right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he was just a temporary member, he still had to do paperwork in order to officially leave the student council. The other day, when Airi had told him about the board chairman's visit, she had also given him these documents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, it all looks good to me." "I'm glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, you're really going to quit, huh? To be honest, I really wanted you to stay in the student council."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san said the same thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was really happy to hear that she wanted him to stay as an official member. The job was indeed a lot of work, but Keiki felt accomplished whenever he helped someone. The feeling of being part of a group in a different sense than with the calligraphy club wasn't bad, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cleaning the pool, working hard for culture festival prep, and making the huge event a success with such a small group of people. This might be similar to how Shiho described her gaming experience.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's all up to you to decide how you want to spend you high school life. You wouldn't want to have any regrets from your one and only adolescence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Adolescence…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once your high school life was over, there was no second time. In order to make sure that you don't regret anything, doing what you enjoy the most is crucial.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun, are there things you want to do?" "I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course there were. It could be said that, in order to achieve that, he went back to the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to experience love." "Love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to start a romance while I'm still going to school, and experience my prime of life that way… Well, there are some difficult circumstances, so I'm having trouble with it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could definitely picture a future where the girls from the calligraphy club would try to obstruct his love if he wasn't able to fix their fetishes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though even if his de-perversion plan actually succeeded, it wouldn't help</p>
<p class="null-p">anything if he didn't manage to get a girlfriend in the end…</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was thinking about that, Shiho suddenly got up from her seat stood in front of her Kouhai.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takasaki-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the distance between them had dramatically decreased, a soft, sweet smell tickled his nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey? Keiki-kun, do you like older girls?" "They're perfect."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you like games, then that means that we share the same hobby, right?" "I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, if you're fine with it-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pausing for a moment, she looked straight into Keiki's eyes before she continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we start dating?"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">*This afterword contains spoilers for the main story so be aware of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with this, 'Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?' volume 7 comes to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time around, we had the culture festival arc, and Keiki and his comrades worked hard to protect the calligraphy club. How did you enjoy it? With the culture festival ushering in a different atmosphere from usual, several supporting roles appeared. And the most prominent of those to me was that of the culture festival committee president. Although our poor protagonist is the one who has to go through all the trouble most of the time, the loser of this volume is definitely that poor soul. Finding out that the person he likes is actually a Rintarou instead if a Rinko must be poison for both the heart and the soul. And of course, Nanjou finding out about Rintarou being a boy, and using her malicious hands to create new material.</p>
<p class="null-p">With new BL couplings born, and the bonds of the members of the calligraphy club growing deeper and stronger, we can safely say that a lot happened this volume, don't you think?</p>
<p class="null-p">And with the culture festival strengthening the colors of spring, especially one's spring of life, I want to go all-out in terms of romcom next volume. With all of these new characters appearing, I want to focus more on the romantic aspects now.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at last, I want to make a huge announcement.</p>
<p class="null-p">An anime adaptation for Hensuki has been decided. The members of the calligraphy club will be moving and talking on the big screen. I've heard from a lot of readers that they've been hoping for an adaptation, so I'm sure</p>
<p class="null-p">that you all must be very happy to hear this news. To celebrate this announcement, there's a beautiful illustration in this 7th installment, with the calligraphy members all in underwear. It's really wonderful (Pervert).</p>
<p class="null-p">Drama CDs, comicalization, and now even an anime adaptation. It's all thanks to my precious readers that the Hensuki series is expanding this intensively. I'll work my hardest to not let the people who love the main material down, as well as the people who love the Hensuki universe in general, so please watch over me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, here's to hoping that we meet each other in the 8th installment.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Hanama Tomo.</p>
