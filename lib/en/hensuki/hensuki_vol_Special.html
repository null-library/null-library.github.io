<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time he came back to his senses, he was in a place unfamiliar to him. "Where… is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki, wearing his school uniform, was standing in the middle of an artificial pure white room. The room was a pretty wide square, and the ground, ceiling, and walls were all colored white. There was no furniture or electric lights in sight, and neither was there a door nor any windows. To put it in simpler terms, the room had a magical-feeling atmosphere. But whatever it was, it certainly wasn't normal by Keiki's standards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Hello there, and welcome to the world after death." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice suddenly spoke from behind his back, and Keiki turned around. When he did, he was greeted by a girl he had never seen before. She was wearing a white one-piece, and her hair was a pale color. The girl, with the body stature of what resembled a grade school student, looked over at Keiki with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am the Goddess Koharu-chan." "Koharu-chan? Wait, Goddess…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I cannot blame you if you are a bit overwhelmed by this situation. But I truly am a Goddess, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, how do you know my name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am a Goddess, after all, so of course I know that much… I-It definitely isn't because I've been stalking you or anything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this sudden tsundere act…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. If you want, you can call me Goddess-chan if you see fit." "Goddess-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you just thought 'she looks more like a child than anything', right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Although I might not look like it, I am in fact older than you, just so you know." She has the looks of a grade school girl, but she's actually older than you-A</p>
<p class="null-p">legal loli.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm, I would like to ask you something, Goddess-chan." "What might that be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You just said something about the world after death?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I certainly did. To be honest with you, this is the place that all souls one day arrive-and although it pains me to say this, you have passed away, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I died?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, your Senpai Koga Yuika pushed her panties too deep into your mouth, and you died from asphyxiation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I remember Yuika-chan stuffing her panties into my mouth…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes ended, Yuika had called Keiki to the small storage room in the library. She had given him an abnormal confession: "Please become Yuika's slave." One thing led to another, and she had stuffed her freshly-worn panties into his mouth. As a result, he seemed to have lost consciousness, and had passed away as he choked on her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So I really died? I didn't even figure out who Cinderella was… I at least wanted to get a cute girlfriend and spend my youth flirting with her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How unfortunate you are, Kiryuu-kun… Dying as a virgin like that…" "Ugh, how could this happen to me? Dying a virgin of all things!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to enjoy his adolescence more. And, if he could, he at least wanted to graduate from his virginity before he died. He felt a truly awful kind of lingering attachment to his previous life as a result…</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I have good news for you, Kiryuu-kun." "What kind of good news?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is actually a way for you to return to the living." "Something like that exists?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It certainly is a harsh method, and it'll be no easy feat by any means. Do you want to know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll do whatever it takes to go back!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His life depended on it, in the truest sense. Having confirmed Keiki's motivation and willpower, the Goddess continued her explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, I would like you to save a certain world." "Save… a world?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a different world from the one you know. Over there, the Demon Lord and their four generals are oppressing innocent civilians. As a Goddess, I cannot overlook their wrongdoings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Oh… This suddenly turned pretty serious…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, since I am that very Goddess, I have my own duties to fulfill. Sadly, there is no time for me to step down there and fight this Demon Lord myself. To be honest, I'm pretty overworked and underpaid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like even goddesses have it tough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I just so happened to see Kiryuu-kun and your unfortunate circumstances when you passed away, so I came up with an idea. I'll give you the rank of a Hero, and you'll save that world in my stead. It's a clever idea, if I do say so myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wondered if he should tell her to fix her own problems, but he worried that would destroy her overflowing self-esteem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, I have to go to this world and defeat the Demon Lord and their four generals, and then I'll be resurrected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what it boils down to, yes. I'm glad that you caught on so fast."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But how am I supposed to defeat them? I'm just an ordinary person, and I don't mean to brag, but I'm like super weak…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do not worry. I have prepared an excellent weapon that will allow you to fight the Demon Lord and Co."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Goddess lifted her index finger. When she did, a bright light distorted the space in front of her, and a single sword appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the proof that you are the Hero, and it will allow you to save the world!</p>
<p class="null-p">The holy sword 'Lolicon Buster'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why does a holy sword have a name like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There had to have been better jokes to make than that. Does she have some kind of grudge against lolicons?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now try to pick it up." "Ah, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Doing as he was told, he tightly grasped the hilt. "…Hm? Wow, this sword feels pretty light." "That's because it's made out of plastic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a toy?! There's no way this can be used for attacking anything!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you might cut yourself if it were a real sword. Blood and violence are an absolute no-go for Koharu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how am I supposed to defeat anybody with this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had never heard of any Demon Lord being defeated with a toy sword. "It is fine, Kiryuu-kun. This sword has a special power hidden within it." "What kind of special power?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You will receive further explanation by the sword itself. I am running low on time here, so I will go ahead and teleport you to the other world immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What do you mean the sword is going to-?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Keiki could finish his sentence, a summoning circle appeared beneath his feet. Judging from what Koharu-chan said, it must be some sort of teleportation gate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then. good luck out there, my dear Hero!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hold on, Goddess-chan?! There are still things I want to know-!" However, the magic activated, completely denying Keiki of any more answers.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the Goddess waved at him with a smile, Keiki was forcefully pulled down into</p>
<p class="null-p">the other world.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sheesh, couldn't she have teleported me a bit more carefully? That Goddess-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki found himself lying in a back alleyway surrounded by brick buildings, looking upwards at the blue sky. He took a moment to throw a complaint at the Goddess. The gate that the Hero had fallen out of wasn't exactly at ground level. It was a bit higher in the air, which made him fall down on his back in agony.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay, Hero-dono?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He heard a voice calling out to him, and someone's face appeared in his field of view. Although the face was upside down from his perspective, it was still a very familiar face to Keiki-</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shouma?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma? Who's that supposed to be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Keiki, who had jumped up out of surprise, the young man in</p>
<p class="null-p">front of him wearing robe-like clothing showed a bewildered expression. He certainly did look like Shouma, but he had the stature of a grade schooler, so it definitely wasn't him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… That makes sense. There's no way Shouma could be this small… But in that case, who in the world are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am the holy sword, Lolicon Buster." "Lolicon Buster…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the boy said this, Keiki flashed him a doubtful expression. After all, the young man certainly didn't look like the sword he had received from the Goddess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Holy swords can turn into humans?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm different from your run-of-the-mill sword, you know. I can change my appearance at will."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sure sounds like a convenient skill…" "Lolicon Buster is pretty long, so just call me Lolii." "I'd really rather not, but… Well, alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki was still a bit taken aback by the sudden turn of events, especially now that he had a talking and form-changing sword, it would be very reassuring to have someone he could trust in this other world where he didn't know left from right. Lolii held out his hand, and Keiki gratefully accepted it and got up from the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, where exactly are we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our current location is in a back street of a city called 'Virgin' in the world you've been transported to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not gonna lie, that name is way too direct for my taste."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't hurt yourself while falling through the transportation gate, right?" "Ahh, I'm fine. It just felt like I was riding some crazy roller coaster there. A bit</p>
<p class="null-p">more than that and I would probably have started screaming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, the Goddess doesn't know how to hold back, does she? Anyway, let's get out on the main road."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds good," Nodding in response to the boy's words, Keiki followed him through the back alley.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once he arrived at the end of that narrow alley, his feet came to a stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is a city from a different world…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Brickwork houses were lined up in rows alongside a stone-paved road that stretched on for as far as he could see. The people walking along that street were all wearing typical fantasy-themed clothing, and Keiki with his blazer stood out quite a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's like an old European city you'd see on TV."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, so there are cities like this in Hero-dono's homeworld?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Still, it seems rather peaceful considering this world is supposed to be under the rule of the demon lord."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This city is as far away from the main battlefield as it gets. But still, be careful. The demon lord might not be here, but his generals are keeping things under control."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what are these generals like?" "Well-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Lolii was about to start his explanation, they heard a clattering sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speak of the devil…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A single horse-drawn carriage came trotting towards them. As soon as the people around them noticed it, one of them screamed "Oh no! It's the tyrant!" and another said "Everyone, hurry and run!" It didn't take long for everyone to break out into a panic, running away to hide in nearby alleys and buildings. This happened in mere seconds. So quickly that Keiki was at a loss as to what was going on, leaving him and Lolii alone on the street when the carriage arrived. Said carriage came to a stop right in front of the two boys. An old-looking butler wearing a fashionable tuxedo stepped down from the driver's pedestal and opened the door to the carriage with smooth, calm movement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What appeared from the interior was a single girl. Her body was wrapped in a jet-black dress. Her long, slender legs that appeared from beneath her skirt smoothly stepped down the carriage steps one by one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The appearance of the girl was so similar to someone Keiki knew that he couldn't hold back his voice. Yes, this girl was the spitting image of his blonde-</p>
<p class="null-p">haired quarter-English Kouhai, Koga Yuika, who Keiki knew all too well. In response to Keiki's outburst, the girl let showed an offended expression.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_Special_2.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"And who are you? You sure are acting over-familiar right off the bat, aren't you? Were you that surprised to see Yuika, a general of the demon lord, here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? A demon lord's general?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, of course! Yuika is very distinguished, you see. Thus, if you don't start calling Yuika 'Yuika-sama,' you might very well be executed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Executed?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that might be taking it a bit too far. That'd be a bit cruel. That being said, make sure that it never happens again, or you might never be able to see the sunlight ever again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that pretty cruel already…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's face was quite cute without a doubt, but the words coming out of her mouth were terrifying. However, it seemed to be true that the girl was indeed a general of the demon lord.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, what might your name be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Keiki, and this here is my partner Lolii."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, so Keiki-san and Lolii-kun. By the way, Keiki-san, Yuika has never seen clothes like that around here. Have you come from some remote region?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I came from Japan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Japan? Yuika has never heard of that land."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was to be expected. Since this was a completely different world, there was no guarantee that Japan existed here at all. While taking to the girl, Keiki came to the conclusion that said girl in front of him wasn't the Kouhai Koga Yuika he knew, but someone entirely different.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it is fine. Rather than some boring commoner from the suburbs, Yuika is more interested in this handsome young man right here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed. You are the exact kind of cute boy that Yuika prefers. How about it? If you are fine with it, you and Yuika could enjoy a bit of tea in her residence."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, the girl had taken a liking to the young man's attractive facial features.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm…" Keiki considered Yuika's invitation, but Lolii answered first.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really sounds like a wonderful invitation, but I'll have to hold off on that. If I'm going to be pampered, I'd rather have a well-endowed Onee-san do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lolii refused Yuika's invitation bluntly. No matter how cute she might look, she still is one of the demon lord's generals. Keiki had thought this too, and also agreed that this wasn't the time to be joining her for some tea, but there was one thing that he couldn't ignore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, huh?! Lolii, don't you prefer moderate and reserved breasts?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course not. My name is Lolicon Buster, you know. I 100% prefer big- breasted ladies rather than flat-chested girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though I know it's not him, hearing someone who looks like Shouma saying these words is giving me the creeps…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike the true lolicon Shouma, Lolii apparently had a thing for older women. Disregarding that for now however, they were still in the middle of the town. If they tried to fight the demon lord's general in such a location, the town's residents would quite possibly get caught up in their battle, and the very feat of defeating her would prove troublesome, seeing that Keiki had never learned how to use Lolii in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's just end this conversation quickly and prepare for the final battle with Yuika- chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">First, they had to make Yuika leave, or so the Hero thought, but something else happened before that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu… I see… Is that so? What a bad kid you are, rejecting Yuika's invitation like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Hero-dono. Does she look mad, or is it just me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, considering the way you rejected her, I can see why she'd get angry." It might not look like it, but Keiki imagined she was boiling with rage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolii-kun, was it?" "Yes, that's me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has changed her mind. You will be taken back to Yuika's residence no matter how much you struggle, and you will learn never to speak like that again to a woman completely out of your league. So be prepared for some harsh training, you animal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you planning on doing to me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika flashed a sadistic smile as she licked her lips. "Now it's your turn, Pochi[1]! Seize this young man at once!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? That old man was named 'Pochi' the whole time?!" Keiki was taken aback by Yuika's mysterious naming sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Pochi, the aged butler, didn't let that chance go to waste. With speed and agility you wouldn't have imagined from someone of his age, he leapt towards Keiki and Lolii, and without giving them any chance to defend themselves, he quickly jabbed at Lolii's neck. Lolii collapsed immediately, and Pochi grabbed the unconscious young boy and brought him back to the carriage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-sama, I have succeeded in capturing the young man." "Good work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that just now?! That was way too quick!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The whole incident occurred in a matter of mere seconds. After performing such inhuman movements with a nonchalant look on his face, the butler put Lolii on the driver's seat, setting his own body down next to him. Yuika also returned to the carriage, flashing a cute smile through the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, Keiki-kun. I will be taking your comrade, then." "Wha-Hold on?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika won't wait~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The carriage mercilessly started to speed up. "L-Lolii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki frantically tried to chase after the carriage, which sadly was fruitless. The carriage, with Lolii on board, grew smaller as it drove into the distance. He had lost the extremely important holy sword he had been entrusted with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… What should I do now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was now left alone in this world that was completely different from his own, and had even lost any means to defend himself. While the newborn Hero was in despair-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-You seem to have it tough, young boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">A familiar voice called out to him, and when he turned around… "Okita-sensei?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet again, it was someone who looked oddly familiar to Keiki. This Okita-sensei was the club advisor for the calligraphy club that Keiki was a member of. With a bewildered expression on her face, the woman stared back at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? I mean, my name is Okita, and I have worked as a teacher before, but… I feel like this is the first time we've met, young boy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She also looks just like someone I know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Usually, there were too many people who looked exactly alike. Keiki was starting to think that his life in this new world wouldn't be all too different from his old one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Either way, I saw that your colleague was taken away by the general of the demon lord, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, and now I'm in a very unfortunate spot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That Yuika girl really is a difficult one. I don't really care about her being a general of the demon lord or whatever, but I really don't appreciate her doing as she pleases in our town. If she were my student, I'd have her sit out in the hallway and reflect on what she's done."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly has she been doing, then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika came here one month ago, and she's occupied this town since. She can use some insanely strong magic, you see. The soldiers who were standing guard in front of this city were decimated, which us defenseless."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Yuika-chan is really strong…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As of right now, no matter what she says or does, nobody can stand against her. She often just rides through the city in her horse-drawn carriage, randomly kidnapping any man who piques her interest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what happens to those men?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"From what the rumours tell us, the men turn into her slaves, and she trains them however she sees fit. Like animals, almost. To be honest, no man has ever returned after he was taken away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds horrible…"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the sounds of it, the Yuika in this world was just as much of a hardcore sadistic queen as the Yuika that Keiki knew already. Now he understood why all the men immediately ran away as soon as the carriage came into view. If Keiki can't save Lolii soon, who knows what cruel training he'll have to go through?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to hurry and save Lolii… Okita-sensei, do you know where Yuika-chan is staying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she's living in the house she stole from the feudal lord… You don't plan on going there alone, do you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My partner is waiting for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're better off not going on a suicide mission like that. You won't be able to do anything alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'm a hero chosen by the Goddess." "A hero?! A-Are you serious?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. I am…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that the hero is supposed to have enough power to even bring down the demon lord… And it seems as if they get summoned from another world. That explains those exotic clothes you're wearing right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"These clothes are exotic?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you really are the hero, then I have a request for you." "What's your request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing is, my lover was taken away a few days ago by Yuika. If you're going to her estate, I'd like you to save him as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Okita-sensei told him the full story. Apparently, her boyfriend had been leaving a bookstore after buying some porn mags. Right then, Yuika showed up quickly carted him off in her carriage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"According to the bookstore owner, he had just bought a special big-breasts feature."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I feel like I can be friends with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">To the average boy, big breasts were almost something to be worshipped. And Keiki was no exception.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm? Big breasts…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Something was wrong. For a moment, an image suddenly came to Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Did something happen, young man?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, no… Anyway, I understand the circumstances. Please leave your boyfriend to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, thank you so much! I know! Please take this! Consider it a token of gratitude."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a smile on her face, Okita-sensei handed Keiki a paper bag. Peeking inside, he spotted several books.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those are all porn mags I confiscated from my boyfriend during class."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't need them, thank you very much?! …Wait a second. During class? … So your boyfriend is a student?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, age doesn't matter in the game of love." "I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">…So it was a forbidden love.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after that, Keiki made his way to Yuika's estate, which Okita-sensei had given him directions to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now I'm here at the residence, but how should I go about doing this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was the former estate of the feudal lord, it was a proper, large residence, surrounded by high fences. On top of that, the entrance was guarded by one soldier, who was dressed in full armor. Getting over the fence would be no easy feat, but neither could Keiki imagine that the guard would just let him past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't even have my sword right now, and I can't exactly fight the guard with just my bare fists…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention that Lolii aka Lolicon Buster was a sword made completely out of plastic, so Keiki couldn't imagine that even that would be of any use against the guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That only leaves me with…"</p>
<p class="null-p">His gaze dropped down to the paper bag. In the end, he had been unable to decline her good-willed gesture, and had unwillingly accepted the porn mags.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without making any noise, Keiki rolled the magazines up like posters and threw them towards the guard with all his might. The sound of the magazines falling to the ground a bit away from the gate gathered the attention of the guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Hm? Did I hear something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gazing at the direction of the sound, the guard carefully approached the magazine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wait, these are all porn magazines. Who left these here? Good grief, how disgraceful."</p>
<p class="null-p">While busy complaining about how disgraceful and inexcusable it was, the guard picked up the magazine nonetheless. He checked his surroundings, and after verifying that nobody had an eye on him, he opened the magazine and</p>
<p class="null-p">started reading.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… A big breasts issue, is it? Not bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, he had taken a liking to it. So much so that he quickly became completely engrossed in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, it's now or never!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having succeeded in distracting the guard, Keiki ran towards the gate at full speed and safely made it inside. From there, he quickly made his way into the main building, trying not to run any risk of being seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like things worked out. All that's left is to find Lolii and Okita- sensei's boyfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">To his misfortune, the interior of the residence was much larger than he had anticipated, and the sheer number of rooms that he could see told him that finding just two people would be no easy feat. He opened several doors, hoping for a stroke of luck, but was met with failure after failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm glad that they don't have any guards here, but at this rate, the day will end before I find them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when he was starting to come up with a new strategy, a blood-curdling scream ran throughout the house. "Ugyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!" Specifically, it seemed to be coming from a room rather close to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He rushed towards the room and threw open the door, only to be greeted with…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, what a wonderful voice that was! Let Yuika hear it some more!" "Stop it with the candleeeeeee!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right in the dead center of the room was Lolii, who was down on all fours and wearing only his underwear. Next to him was Yuika, who had an entranced expression on her adorable face as she slowly poured molten wax onto the boy's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What are you doing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was more perplexed than anything else after seeing this weird S&M play. "My. Just when Yuika was busy wondering whose appearance she had been</p>
<p class="null-p">honored with, it looks like it's Keiki-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono, so you came to save me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero? Keiki-san is supposed to be the hero?" "Ah, yeah. That's what I was told…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's not like it matters in the grand scheme of things. As you can see, Yuika is busy training Lolii-kun. She doesn't have any time to play with you, so go home, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mood had probably turned slightly sour from being interrupted during her fun. However, running away wasn't an option for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be like that. I wanted to chat some more while I'm already here." "No thank you. Yuika isn't interested at all in Keiki-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I believe you should very well have some interest." "Ohh? And why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because… I also love big breasts!" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">All emotion vanished from Yuika's face after that sudden declaration. "What is this about, Hero-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"All the men that Yuika-chan took with her had one fatal thing in common.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that was the fact that they all love big breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">Okita-sensei's boyfriend had just finished buying some special big-breast magazines from the bookstore. And Lolii, after Yuika invited them to tea, had proudly declared that he preferred big breasts over everything else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm assuming that Yuika-chan has some sort of complex about her tiny chest. That's why she can't forgive any man who likes big breasts, and she's taking them by force here to 're-educate' them, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Keiki's guess had hit the mark, because Yuika grit her teeth in frustration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's right! It's just as you said! Yuika can't keep watching all the men who admire big breasts, so she felt the urge to train them properly! Sorry for having small breasts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, small ones also have their own charm, and I think they're cute no matter the size."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So you say, but you still love big breasts, right?" "Naturally!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"See!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wouldn't lie about his own feelings. Naturally, he wouldn't badmouth any other size, but if he had to choose, his allegiance belonged to the big-breast- worshipping camp.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever! Someone who likes big breasts would never understand the feelings of a flat-chested girl, so Yuika will just train you if she has to!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Yuika announced that, several orbs of fire appeared around her. "W-What are those?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono, be careful! The demon lord's generals can use destructive magic!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Okita-sensei told me about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Magic exists in this world. Apparently, the ones who stand at the top of all magic users are the demon lord and their generals. Now Keiki fully understood how all the town's guards had fallen victim to Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This arrogant and cheeky hero can turn to ash for all Yuika cares!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fireballs started flying at Keiki with the full intention of wiping him off the face of this earth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm dead. This time for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past world, he had died of asphyxiation, and in this world, he would be burned to death. Either way, he was still fated to die a virgin. And the moment he had accepted this grim fate-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-donoooooo!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the last second, Lolii jumped between Keiki's body and the fireballs. Shortly after, a loud explosion rang out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolii?! You… sacrificed yourself… for me…?" "I'm not dead yet, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he lifted his head, Keiki's view was filled by the same Lolii as before, who was still wearing only a pair of underwear on his otherwise naked body. The rope that had hindered his movement before had been burned away, but there was not a single wound to be found on his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-How are you alive?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph. I'm the holy sword, you know? In order to assist you in defeating the</p>
<p class="null-p">demon lord, I have been granted the ability to nullify any sort of magic." "You're actually pretty amazing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nullifying any magic was basically a cheat skill. However, it was hard to really admire it too much with Lolii standing in front of him, still half naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way… Yuika's magic had no effect…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Hero-dono! Use me to strike down the general of the demon lord!" "What should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can change my physical form into any shape. Using that skill, you can give her enough of a scolding that she'll never do anything bad again!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A scolding… for Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it might sound more perverted than anything, it was all to save this world. There was no time to hesitate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To change my appearance, you just have to touch me and imagine the form that you want me to take."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Lolii's guidance, Keiki put one hand on the boy's back. Imagining the tool that would be most effective for this situation, in order to defeat the demon lord's general, the hero chose-</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are those chains?! Noo?! Where are you touching…?! Yuika can't…!" With Lolii having his form changed into those of chains, Keiki rushed towards</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika with snake-like movement and used the chains to bind up the girl. The</p>
<p class="null-p">chains even had the anti-magic effect that Lolii possessed. Now that Yuika was in this situation, she had no chance of escaping. In the end, she was unable to even stand, and she sank down onto the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We did it, Hero-dono! We captured Yuika!" "Good work, Lolii!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Lolii was still able to talk while he was in this form. Very useful indeed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So how does it feel to be tied up yourself, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… Do you think you'll be forgiven for doing this to Yuika?! She will just tell the demon lord about you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh? It seems like you have no intention of reflecting on your actions." "A-And what about it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the country where I came from, there is a special disciplinary technique. It's called 'spanking', you see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This technique consists of spanking kids that have done wrong on the butt." "On the butt… Eh, no way… You're kidding… right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No? I'm 100% serious~" "N-Noooooooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, Keiki didn't stop. Keiki felt no hesitation whatsoever when it came to it, and he flashed a fiendish smile while lifting Yuika's tender body. The spanking commenced, and cries for help resounded throughout the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, are you finally reflecting on your actions?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes… Sniff… Yuika has reflected on her actions. She won't do anything bad anymore, so please forgive her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I forgive you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having somewhat safely made it through the spanking, Yuika sank down to the ground, wiping away her tears. The young boy Lolii, who had gone outside the room, came back. He had reverted back to his human appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono, I went and freed the people you told me about." "Ahh, good work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means this is one job done." "Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gazing outside the window, Keiki watched the freed prisoners greeting their families and lovers. It was a truly tear-jerking sight. Okita-sensei was also there, and was reuniting with her boyfriend-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sensei, I think that age should put up boundaries when it comes to love…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Okita-sensei's boyfriend was clearly a young shouta boy, of grade school age at most. This world that Keiki had been thrown into in order to gain a second chance was different, and the Okita-sensei he had encountered here was without a doubt a shotacon.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, as gratitude for saving the town and its people, Keiki received a free stay at an inn. He rose at the same time the night came to an end and left the</p>
<p class="null-p">city Virgin with Lolii.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Hero-senpai!" "Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, the flat girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, don't call Yuika that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Waiting at the town's gate was the general of the demon lord they had fought the day before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Yuika-chan, what is this 'Hero-senpai' about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-san is older than Yuika, and you're also the hero, so you're Hero-senpai." "I see. And why are you waiting for us here this early in the morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wants to travel with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You want to travel with us? You're one of the demon lord's generals, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Won't it be treason against the demon lord if you travel with us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has lost her place in Virgin, and she thought that it might be more fun to travel with Hero-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"More fun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, you'd better be prepared. Once you show a slight opening, you will become Yuika's slave."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, Lolii, let's leave her and go our way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that was a lie. Yuika is sorry. She won't do anything, so please take her with you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm… Lolii, what do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it fine? I'm sure that she'll end up being helpful if she becomes our comrade."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well said, Lolii!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, if you say so."</p>
<p class="null-p">One more person to rely on wasn't a bad thing by any means. Even a former general of the demon lord, who was planning on turning Keiki into her slave the moment he let down his guard, would still be helpful to have around… Probably… Maybe…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'd better be prepared for you to try to trap me, then." "What do you mean by that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jokes aside, since you're one of the demon lord's generals, you must know where the big bad or the other generals are, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed. The demon lord is in the royal capital. The demon lord made the castle their residence there after ousting the king. The other generals should be stationed in the towns on the way there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So by heading towards the royal capital, we'll encounter the other generals as we go, and the demon lord will be the final boss."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Walking to the royal capital from here takes around one month, though." "One month?! …Are there no taxis in this world…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I can become a dragon if needed. If we soar through the skies, we'll be there in no time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, that's so cool!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't believe how valuable a plastic holy sword could be. "Are you two prepared?" Lolii asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, all OK."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is ready as well!" "Now then, let's get going!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Outside the town of Virgin, Keiki and Yuika sat on the back of Lolii, who had turned into a giant winged lizard. He flapped his wings and they rose up into the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This really is a fantasy world…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Flying on the back of a dragon made Keiki feel like he was in a movie. The scenery around the town widened up, and in the distance he spotted a forest and a line of mountains. Judging from the topography, you would have to go through the forest if you wanted to move forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This really would have taken a long time by foot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And thanks to Lolii-kun, it's turned into something enjoyable like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really would have preferred that a beautiful Onee-san would ride me, and not another man and a flat girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you call Yuika flat one more time, she'll blast you away with her magic, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sucks for you that magic doesn't have any effect on me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be the one who suffers from that the most, so please don't."</p>
<p class="null-p">While wondering if they were actually close to their destination or not, Keiki gazed down at the forest they were flying over, but just then they heard something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A woman's shriek reached all the way up to the skies where they were travelling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that scream just now?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someone seems to be getting attacked inside the forest." "What should we do, Hero-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't exactly ignore this, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought so! Alright, you two, grab on! It's time to descend!" Lolii quickly dove down towards the forest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, over there!" Yuika exclaimed. Keiki quickly looked where she was pointing. In a small clearing inside the forest, he spotted a human person, who presumably had let out that scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The closer they got, the more clear the situation became to Keiki. A woman truly was being attacked. However, the assailant wasn't another human. Instead, there were multiple aggressors: Vines that wriggled about like living creatures. Rising up from the ground, countless vines were grabbing the body of the woman, holding her tight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch?! S-Someone, save meeeee!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The victim let out a cry for help. She was wearing a maid uniform for no apparent reason, and she had long black hair and seemed rather young at first glance. Not to mention that Keiki knew her very well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…? S-Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was his upperclassmen, as well as the club president of the calligraphy club, who Keiki knew from his former world. She was a beauty with big breasts, and she had a hobby of teasing her Kouhai whenever she got the chance. This black- haired woman, the spitting image of Tokihara Sayuki, was currently in great peril as she was being assaulted by what looked like tentacles.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="null-p">After soaring through the skies on Lolii, who had changed his form into that of a dragon, Keiki and the others spotted a maid being assaulted by a tentacle-like monster as they passed over a forest. Countless vines were stretching out of the ground to grab hold of a girl who looked exactly like Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, are you okay?!" "Eh? W-Who are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant Lolii landed in the forest clearing, Keiki jumped off onto the ground and quickly ran over to the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Sayuki, yes, but I feel like this is the first time we've met?" "So you're only a lookalike…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really get it, but could you do me a favour and save me?" "That's what I was planning on doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was a monster, it was still just a plant. Keiki went to rip away the vines that were holding onto the girl's body, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kufuuuuuuun?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The vines whipped back at Keiki, and his body was thrown backwards. After flying through the air a short ways, he landed on the ground on his back, right at the feet of Yuika and Lolii. Lolii had already returned to his human form.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-senpai, trying to fight a monster without a weapon is like having a death wish, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I just realized that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a very typical kind of plant monster that lives in this forest. Although it is a monster that targets humans, nobody has ever died because of them, so I think she'll be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really? That's good, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, they do secrete some special kind of acid that melts clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">It does what…? Lifting his body up from the ground, Keiki's gaze wandered over towards the maid. He thought he saw the vines emitting some sort of ooze, and</p>
<p class="null-p">he saw that parts of the girl's maid uniform had started to burn away. "Nooooo?! Not my clothes!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's not fine at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As it turns out, this monster was nothing but a huge pervert. Holes appeared in Sayuki's maid uniform, offering glances of her white skin and flashy underwear. At this rate, she might end up completely naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have to hurry and save her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But how will you do that? Even if I turn into a weapon, that thing will attack the second you come closer, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The enemy consisted entirely of multiple tentacles emerging from the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if you cut off one, another one would take its place. "…Haah, there's no other choice, it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will take care of this."</p>
<p class="null-p">The frills of her black dress shook, and the girl stepped to the front. She turned towards the tentacles and let loose bullets of fire aimed the roots of the tentacles. Plants are defenseless against fire. Apparently, even monsters made out of plants were no exception, and these tentacles quickly burned away. Having been freed from her restriction, Sayuki fell down to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Careful!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this rate, she'd hit the ground hard enough to hurt herself. Keiki kicked the ground, dashing towards her, and successfully caught her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That was close…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he let out a sigh of relief, his gaze dropped down to the girl in his hands. Not intentionally, of course, but rather by his instinct as a man, his gaze naturally wandered towards the valley of her chest. When she noticed where he was looking, the girl nervously fidgeted and bashfully tried to cover the parts where the tentacles had eaten through her maid uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… This is pretty embarrassing, so could you not stare too much?" "Ah, I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm kidding. It gets me excited, so please stare even more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, which is it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The virgin boy panicked ever so slightly, not knowing where to look for a second. Apparently, the Sayuki in this world also loved to tease others. But Keiki disregarded his confusion for a second and safely set the girl down on the ground.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_Special_3.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for saving me. The tentacles were about to rob me of my precious virginity."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to go that far…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika was the one who defeated the monster, though?" "Oh, I was wondering who that was. It's Yuika-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, do you two know each other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course we do. That person is also one of the demon lord's generals. Since we graduated from the same magic school, Yuika calles her Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, wow."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was surprised that he had met two generals of the demon lord in such quick succession. This new world might be smaller than Keiki thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And may I ask who you might be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Keiki. And this person here is Lolii."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello there. You have a wonderful pair of breasts, Onee-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's some fine sexual harassment there… Well, it's not like I dislike having men look at me with lewd eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Senpai in this world is just as much of a pervert, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki gave Sayuki a quick rundown of the situation. That he had come to this world in order to defeat the demon lord. How he managed to discipline Yuika in the city Virgin. And finally, that they happened to spot Sayuki being attacked as they were heading towards the next city.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see. So you're the hero who appeared in this world to save it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. But what exactly where you doing in a place like this, Sayuki-senpai?" "It'll turn into a longer story, but… Nanjou-san and I conquered the city a ways</p>
<p class="null-p">away from here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai, you were with Nanjou-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. After that, we took over the feudal lord's residence and started reigning over the city, but we had a disagreement over how we should rule the town, so we parted ways. Since it wasn't fun at all, I just ran away from home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's when you got attacked by tentacles in the forest here." "Pretty much… By the way, why is Hero-kun addressing me as 'Senpai'?" "I mean, you seem older than me, from the looks of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The truth was that she looked identical to the Sayuki-senpai he knew, so not adding the 'Senpai' would feel off to him. Just then, Lolii jumped into the conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, it seems like the next general, Nanjou, is living in the next city. Let's free that city from her rule and then make our way to the capital."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging from the name 'Nanjou', Keiki already could guess that the next general would look identical to the Nanjou Mao he knew. Judging from the flow of events thus far, this didn't seem too far-fetched an idea. Though he was a bit worried as to how powerful she might be, seeing that she was one of the demon lord's generals.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you plan to do, Sayuki-senpai? If you try to get in our way, we'll have to fight you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need for that anymore. I have been freed from the shackles of being a general of the demon lord."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. After all-I've found another place of employment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after she said these words, the girl suddenly embraced Keiki. Her well-endowed chest started pressing against him, and she rubbed her cheek on his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, Sayuki-senpai?! What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, you see… When you were embracing me just now, my heart started beating really fast…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I even got a bit wet." "What are we talking about again?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't forget the debt I owe you for saving me from those perverted tentacles… That being said, I'll be your very own maid from today onwards, Hero- kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You shot me down that quickly?! I-I'm a super hardcore masochist, you know, so I'll obey any order you give me, no matter how lewd it is!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that's exactly why I don't need you as a maid!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, the Sayuki from this world was just as much of a masochistic pervert as the one from Keiki's original world. And even though this was a different world, Keiki's stance that he would give his first time to the girl he loves hadn't changed. This perverted maid's temptations wouldn't work against the Hero. After Sayuki's confession (?) ended in failure, Yuika took the initiative.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see that Witch-senpai is still as much of a pervert as ever. You seem to stil want to be used as a sex toy by every boy you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, I don't want to be told that by the person who wants to make a slave out of every boy she meets."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Grrr…" "Hmph~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them glared at each other, and sparks seemed to fly through the air between them. Since he had seen enough of this sight in his old world to grow tired of it already, Keiki let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lolii glanced at him and spoke up. "What should we do, Hero-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After giving the question a bit of thought, Keiki replied. "It seems like a bother, so let's just leave both of them here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without showing any mercy, the Hero decided to leave the two of them behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the two fighting girls behind, Keiki once again rode on Lolii's back. They flew all the way to the next village and descended to the ground near the outskirts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But was it really the right call to leave them behind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This might have been the best decision I've made all year, to be honest."</p>
<p class="null-p">Some men might feel a bit guilty for leaving two girls alone in a forest full of tentacle monsters, but Keiki felt no remorse at all. Not to mention that, while they were flying off, he heard them screaming things like "Running away won't do you any good! Either way, you'll definitely become Yuika's slave!" and "You'll definitely become my master!" This only helped reassure Keiki that leaving them behind was the right choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, even if something happens to them, Yuika-chan can just blow the tentacles away with her magic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"True. Worst-case, they'll just end up butt-naked."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no actual threat to their lives. While ending up naked might be a dilemma for girls of their age, Keiki had to focus on finding the third general now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is the city that Sayuki-senpai was talking about…" "Yeah. By the way, this city is named 'Cherry Boy'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is up with these city names?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe this world held some sort of grudge against virgins. As Keiki approached the gate together with the human-form Lolii, he realized that this city wasn't all too different from Virgin. It was a fairly normal kind of city that you could find anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first glance, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong here…Hm?</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmmm?!?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so he thought, but as they progressed further, they were confronted with a truly shocking sight. Keiki spotted the terrace of what seemed to be a cafe in front of him. A couple was sitting at a table with a drink in front of them and two straws coming out of it. They both were drinking out of it at the same, but the sight of a couple being lovey-dovey wasn't the reason why Keiki found himself shocked. No, the problem was that the couple consisted of two young men.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, look, Hero-dono! Over there! Two men are eating a crepe and acting all flirty!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, this city wasn't as normal as Keiki thought it was at first glance. To be precise, it was riddled with pairs of men. A lovey-dovey couple of two young boys was leaning against each other on a bench. A pair of middle-aged men passed by them, holding hands. It truly was a surreal scene. The final blow was dealt by the sight of a young boy with a flushed face standing in front of a water fountain and kissing a flashy, long-haired boy on the cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is wrong with this city?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's male couples wherever you look."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I don't see a single woman anywhere…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, there seem to be some. Like the employee of that shop over there… Ah, over there in the window, as well. It seems like they aren't allowed to leave the house?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of rule is that supposed to be? Just what is going on here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Lolii's assumption proved to be true, what kind of meaning would there</p>
<p class="null-p">be in establishing that sort of rule?</p>
<p class="null-p">-You who cherishes big-breasted girls more than the sturdy chest of a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm? Did you just say something, Lolii?" "No, I didn't say anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">-Using my magic, you will awaken to the wonderful world of BL!</p>
<p class="null-p">"H… uh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this feeling that is slowly starting to rise up from the depths of my chest? Keiki wondered. When he looked at Lolii right in front of him, he found himself unable to calm down, and his heart started racing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolii…" "Hero-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I take a closer look at you like this… your face is actually quite cute." "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me see it some more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Hold on a second! What are you talking about, Hero-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, there's no need to be flustered. Seeing you acting like that makes me want to kiss you so much that I can't help it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah?! Wait, Hero-dono?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't suppress the overflowing love inside his chest. When he saw Lolii making that cute face, it made him want to rain down a flood of passionate kisses.</p>
<p class="null-p">So what if the other person is a boy? Like I would care about that! This immoral feeling makes my heart race even faster!</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki found himself unable to hold back his desires. The only desire in his mind was one to exchange a kiss with Lolii. He put his hands on the boy's cheeks and slowly brought his face closer-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you wake up already?!" "Ouch?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lolii mercilessly brought his hand down on Keiki's head, which caused Keiki to regain his sanity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?! W-What was I doing just now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono was really passionately trying to kiss me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why would I do something that nightmarishly weird?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's my line. Did you suddenly change your tastes or something?" "As if! It's just… I suddenly heard a really weird voice in my head…" "What did it say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It said something like 'Awaken to the wonderful world of BL!' And after that, you just looked really charming and cute to me for some reason…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's what this is about." "Did you figure something out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I finally understand what's wrong with this city. This is brainwashing magic.</p>
<p class="null-p">All the residents here have had their hearts influenced by it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, somebody used magic to create gay couples all over the city?" "Exactly. Still, it's crazy hard to cast a spell like this over an entire city. This</p>
<p class="null-p">must be the work of the demon lord's general that Sayuki-dono was talking</p>
<p class="null-p">about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Just what kind of benefit would there be to doing something like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The city was overflowing with couples practicing forbidden love. What kind of reason would there be to create something like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it looks like the brainwashing doesn't work on you, Lolii."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because magic has no effect against me. That's why the brainwashing was broken when I just hit you on the head like that. However, you'll definitely fall victim to the spell again once some time passes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess we don't have the luxury of time, then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll eventually start to get excited and try to kiss me again." "Please don't remind me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it'll be fine as long as you keep touching me during our search for the general. If you do that, the brainwashing won't have any effect on you, Hero- dono."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to not be affected by the brainwashing magic, the measure that the Hero-dono took is-</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is pretty tough on my mental health."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'd rather do this with a beautiful Onee-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, Keiki and Lolii were being all buddy-buddy and friendly. They were walking through the street, hand in hand. Although there wasn't anything he could do about it, this was an experience that Keiki wished he could have avoided.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolii. Let's hurry to where the general is. I don't want to do this for any longer than is necessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No objections from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐a‐</p>
<p class="null-p">It was fairly easy to spot the mayor's manor. Since it was the residence of a powerful and influential person, it stood out very prominently from all the other buildings around it, leaving Keiki and Lolii with no need to ask any townsfolk where it was. There weren't even any guards at the gate, so sneaking inside was an easy task, unlike how it was with Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like this place is outside the range of the brainwashing magic." "Alright then, let's stop holding hands."</p>
<p class="null-p">FInally freed from that awkward situation, the two boys separated their hands and headed inside. When they had a look around, not only were there not any guards, but neither were there any other people working or living there. They walked through the hallway, silence all around…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Found her."</p>
<p class="null-p">They spotted someone in the dead center of a wide room on the second floor. Sitting on a wooden chair was a girl with reddish brown hair and a side-tail hanging down on one side of her head. As Keiki expected, the girl looked exactly like Nanjou Mao. For some reason, she was wearing a female police officer uniform, and she was using a brush to paint a canvas in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you Nanjou, the general of the demon lord?" "Who are you two?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao-or rather, Nanjou-raised her head in surprise at the sudden arrival of visitors. She narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Keiki. I'm the hero who was sent to this world in order to defeat the demon lord."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I'm his partner, the holy sword Lolii~" "The hero and the holy sword…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We already know that you're using some kind of brainwashing magic against</p>
<p class="null-p">the townsfolk. We've come here to stop that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This fiendish bastard of a Hero-dono right here really enjoys spanking bad girls on the butt in order to discipline them. I really think it'd be better for you to just give up and swear to never do anything like this again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not make me sound like the bad guy here?! I'm the hero!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had disciplined Yuika like that, but in that case it was unavoidable. Keiki actually didn't possess any sexual desires like that!</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see. I understand why you came here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou set the paint palette and the brush down on the table and stood up. "However, it pains me to say it that your wish won't be granted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like you have your own goal, there is something that I have to do no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what is your goal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That should be plain as day. In order to create the finest piece of art imaginable, I have to see boys being lovey-dovey with each other, live and in person!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono, what is this person saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have the slightest idea," Keiki replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, normal people like you probably wouldn't understand. It might actually be better to show you the real thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The real thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou picked up the canvas that she had been working on a second ago and turned it so that Lolii and Keiki had a clear view of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha?! T-That's…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Drawn on the canvas was a scene with two young men loving each other gently as they lay on a bed. Of course, everyone should immediately understand what is meant by the phrase 'loving each other.' After all, both of the men were naked. Sweat ran down their muscular bodies, and while one looked aggressive and the other looked defensive, both of them showed expressions of pure joy and pleasure. The drawing looked so realistic that it felt like it might start moving any second. While they were admiring Nanjou's skill at drawing, she gave them</p>
<p class="null-p">the final piece of missing information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the fine arts that I am pursuing! BL!" She proudly declared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou was a pervert who specialized in everything relating to BL. A fujoshi, if you will.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course she has the same stick even in a different world…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You used brainwashing magic on the entire town just to help you have material to draw…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. It was really tough preparing all that, you know. I induced the idea that the men in the town would only have feelings for the same gender, and I brainwashed the women to stay indoors all day. Just walking around the city, I can gather references and data left, right, and center."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How could you do something so terrifying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can say that again. Because of you, I Hero-dono almost stole my first kiss."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, tell me more about that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't fixate on that… Just how addicted to BL are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou's eyes were sparkling after hearing Lolii's comment, and Keiki had to take a step back out of bewilderment. Everything he had seen so far in this city, every little flirty action of the male couples, was all just for reference material for her own work.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please don't tell me that the Nanjou in my world is also a fujoshi…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki would soon find out in the original source material-but that's a different story.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't allow you to play with the hearts of other people on a whim! As the hero, it's my duty to strike you down!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just try it if you can! I'll make you regret opposing my ideal world! To be precise, I'll be drawing a wonderful BL picture of the two of you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A BL picture together with Lolii of all people… just from imagining that, a shiver ran down Keiki's spine. Even more so since Lolii actually looked so much like his friend Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, I have the holy sword with me. I'll just tell you up front. Lolii has the ability to nullify any magic you throw at me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph, not bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Just that? Shouldn't you be a bit more taken aback than that?" "Magic isn't the only thing I have at my disposal, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying this, Nanjou put her hand behind her waist. When her hand reappeared from beside the holster that was peeking out, she was holding a handgun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If magic won't work, then how about this?" "Woah, guns are allowed?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. They're just rubber bullets, so you won't die. However-" Nanjou pulled the trigger on the gun, and the bullet flew past Keiki's face,</p>
<p class="null-p">hitting the flower vase behind him. The vase exploded into pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-If the bullet hits you, it'll hurt so much that you wish you were dead." "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki saw the insane damage caused by this rubber bullet, he swallowed his words. In the meantime, Nanjou pointed the gun at him and spoke up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then-How about we start this competition?" "Tactical retreat!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she wasn't using real bullets, a gun was still a gun. If it was some kind of offensive magic, Keiki might have been able to stand his ground thanks to Lolii, but bullets were too much for him to handle. Hence, he judged that a retreat would be more beneficial in the long run, and so he grabbed Lolii's hand and dashed out of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really didn't expect her to just pull out a gun like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we're hit with that, we won't get off with just a bruise, you know! What should we do, Hero-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What else can we do but run away for now?! Woah, she's still not done?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While they were running and talking about their plans, yet another bullet raced past the hero's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch, I missed… Hey, you hero! You'll pay for stealing precious work time from me, you hear!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-san, how about we talk this out?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think she'll just let us escape like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two boys were running for their lives. Chasing after them, gun in hand,</p>
<p class="null-p">was a demon of a police woman. From an outstander's perspective, Keiki and Lolii would probably look like the perpetrators of some kind of crime.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was wondering why she was cosplaying like that! It's all to match the gun that she has!</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was thinking that, a flurry of bullets raced past him. Since the girl behind them was running as well, her accuracy luckily wasn't very good, but just the sound of the gunshots ringing out behind them inflicted fear and terror on the hero's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki now had become desperate and frantic. Nanjou was scary, the gun was scary, and he really didn't want to be turned into BL drawing material.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolii! As soon as we get down to the first floor, we're running for it!" "Alright!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They dashed down the hallway and finally arrived at the stairs. "As if I'd let you get away!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The second Keiki thought that he was safe, something flew past him. It seemed to be the size of a baseball, and it started rolling down the stairs. Since he had seen this object in movies before, Keiki immediately realized what was happening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A hand grenade?!" "Careful, Hero-dono!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he knew what was happening, there was nothing he could do about it. The instant Lolii's scream rang out, the hand grenade exploded in front of their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah, it's bright!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My eyes! My eyeeeeeees!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The blessing in disguise was that the hand grenade wasn't meant to kill, but it was more like a stun grenade. Its purpose was to render the enemy immobile and unable to defend themselves. The two boys were unscathed, but their eyesight was not. However, they were currently at the top of the stairs. Now, what happens if you lose your sight while trying to run down a staircase?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Augh, I can't see where I'm going?! …Ah, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono?! Are you okay-Wah, waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The natural result was that Keiki and Lolii lost their footing and fell down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Lolii, that hurts…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Hero-dono… I didn't mean to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was lying upwards on the ground with Lolii on top of him. As the two of them were struggling to get off each other, a calm, almost cold voice called out to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You two…" "N-Nanjou?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki lifted his head, he saw Nanjou standing at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah… it's all over. We've lost.</p>
<p class="null-p">The winner of the game of tag had been decided. The hero and his companion wouldn't be able to get up quickly enough. As soon as the girl used her gun, it would be game over. Accepting the fate that was about to befall him, the hero closed his eyes and resigned himself. With this, his mission to defeat the demon lord would end in failure. He would be unable to keep his promise to the Goddess, and he would never be able to return to his original world-Or so he thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? She's not attacking?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much time passed, no more gunshots rang out. Keiki slowly and carefully opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The innocent young man, unable to withstand his desires, pushes down the other boy! How indecent! No, how wonderful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Keiki found himself getting a really bad premonition from the girl's words. So much so that he didn't even bother trying to grasp the meaning behind what she was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guhu… Guhuhuhuhuhu… After turning into human form, the holy sword inserts his Excalibur into the hero, who screams out as pleasure runs through his body. 'Just how much do you have to make me suffer until you're satisfied?!'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not have weird fantasies with the two of us?!" Also, why did she have to make Lolii the Excalibur?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice…" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice BL boys!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nanjou left these words behind and collapsed to the ground, a fountain of blood spurting out of her nose. Keiki and Lolii carefully got up and checked her condition. She seemed to be unconscious. She was lying in a puddle of blood with a bright smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like she self-destructed." "That was one hell of a fight…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl had been rendered unable to fight any longer because of her fantasies running rampant. Thus, the hero managed to defeat another one of the demon lord's generals, and freed the townsfolk of the brainwashing magic that had been plaguing them.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">After Nanjou had regained her senses, Keiki made her promise that she would never cause any trouble again. Once she agreed, the hero and holy sword stepped out of the feudal lord's residence and gazed up at the already dark sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief, what a horrible day this was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, she asked us to be models for her BL drawings, and wouldn't let us go when we said no…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Nanjou's enthusiasm towards BL was too overwhelming, the condition for her dispelling the brainwashing magic on the town was that Keiki and Lolii would become models for her BL drawings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, we promised to do that once we defeat the demon lord, but…" "Do you have any plans to keep that promise?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course not. I'll be going straight back to my own world once the demon lord is defeated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like he hated Lolii or anything of that sort, but ending up as BL material in itself was something he'd rather avoid.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But our hard work has been rewarded, so it's fine I guess." "Yeah, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki looked once more out over the city, which was vastly different from</p>
<p class="null-p">before their assault on the residence. No more male couples were in sight. Normal man ‐ woman couples filled the cafés, holding hands as they walked past Keiki. Since the brainwashing magic from Nanjou was gone, Cherry Boy had returned to its original state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty late already, so let's look for a place to spend the night." "Yeah, good idea. I've gotten a bit hungry, too-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Keiki stepped forward to follow Lolii… "!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment his right foot hit the ground, stinging pain ran up his leg. "Were you hurt during our battle?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… I might have twisted my ankle when we fell down the stairs." "I think it'd be better to get this get checked at a hospital."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, something like this is no problem. No worries."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do. There's still one general left, and you have to be in top form when we go fight the demon lord. As your partner, I can't overlook any injury no matter how small it may be."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You worry too much, Lolii. But alright, fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I lend you my shoulder until we get to the hospital?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd gratefully accept your help, but the difference in height between us might make that impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah I see, then-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lolii used his transformation powers and grew to the same size as Keiki. After doing that, he looked exactly like the Shouma that Keiki knew so well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no problem now, right?" "You're as useful of a sword as ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">They made their way to the hospital. Keiki limped along the street with Lolii lending him a shoulder until they made it to their destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sure looks like a worn-out hospital…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I heard that the doctor here is very skilled. And the nurse seems to be really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that's what I like to hear."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being treated by a cute nurse would make all the hardship of fighting Nanjou worth it in the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd really like a big-breasted Onee-san nurse."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels really weird for you to say that when you're looking like that…" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Shouma of his own world would never say anything like that. The dichotomy was too great for Keiki to handle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I agree with you that a big-breasted Onee-san nurse would be nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just standing outside while talking like this wouldn't get them anywhere. Lolii opened the front door, and inside was what looked to be a waiting room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me! Is someone here?!" "-Yeeees!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The long-awaited nurse poked her head out from the depths of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. The doctor is currently out on a house visit, so could I ask you to wait a short while?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The angel in a white robe looked apologetic as she spoke. "Ohh, she's just as cute as the rumours said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lolii was admiring the adorable nurse, who had short hair that reached down to her shoulders. Keiki's reaction however was less admiration and more like resignation. After all-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am the registered nurse of this hospital, Mizuha. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this time it's a Mizuha look-alike…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The nurse standing in front of them was an exact clone of Keiki's little sister, Mizuha. Since this sort of thing had happened all the time after Keiki arrived in this world, he was not terribly shocked to run into someone who looked exactly like his little sister. However, in this case, it was slightly different from before…</p>
<p class="null-p">"……" "Mizuha… san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was supposed to have been their first meeting, the girl was practically staring at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you… Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it really is Nii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's face lit up, and she jumped at Keiki, embracing him. "Nii-san, I wanted to meet you so badly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh?! What is this about?!"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_Special_4.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Even though this was supposed to be a different world, and she should only</p>
<p class="null-p">look like Mizuha…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… I can just leave if I'm in the way?" "Lolii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's partner, apparently reading too much into the atmosphere, stepped out of the waiting room. Now that it had come to this, Keiki had to confirm his suspicions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm… you know who I am?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I do. How could I ever forget my Nii-san?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that really the case?</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't tell me… did she come here from our original world? To chase after her older brother who died from asphyxiation?</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it some more, Keiki decided that it would be impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, Mizuha started speaking while still clinging to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You just went missing like that, and now I finally meet you again in a place like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Went missing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah! Around one year ago, you just disappeared without any warning." "Ahhh, so that's what it was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like there was even a Keiki look-alike in this world. And the Mizuha and Keiki of this world were also siblings. This world's Keiki disappeared, and Mizuha had seen the current Keiki and mistaken him for her 'Nii-san.' When Keiki arrived at this conclusion, he decided that he couldn't allow this misunderstanding to go on any longer. He put his hands in Mizuha's shoulders and gently pushed her away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen… this really hurts me to say, but I'm not your Nii-san." "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… I came from a different world, and I'm tasked with defeating the demon lord."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you understand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san… Did you catch chuunibyou while you were gone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No I didn't! I might have twisted my ankle, but my head is still functioning properly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki quickly tried to clear up the misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway. It might be difficult, but you have to believe me when I say that I am not your Nii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a lie. I wouldn't mistake my Nii-san." "But, I'm really not…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if I would… mistake you…" "Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw that the girl about to break out in tears, a sharp pain stabbed Keiki's heart. She might look just like the Mizuha he knew, his own little sister, but she wasn't. However, watching the girl cry in front of him would be too hard on his heart. He couldn't really explain it, but his heart was screaming that he couldn't make her cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, I just didn't know how to act around you since it's been so long!</p>
<p class="null-p">Sorry, Nii-san was just joking!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought so! Really, you're such a teaser, Nii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure became a cutie, Mizuha! That nurse outfit really suits you!" "Really? Nii-san is praising me… I'm really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha-san lowered her head bashfully when her older brother praised her. In response, a feeling of guilt assaulted the fake older brother's heart even more than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that reminds me. You came here because of a foot injury, right, Nii-san?" "Ahh yeah, I fell down some stairs today, see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you can just spend the night here. I'll explain the situation to the doctor, so I'll cook something for you after all this time! Okay? Let's do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, yeah, that sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">She must be really happy to finally be reunited with her older brother who had disappeared. A fire was burning in the angel's eyes since she was now able to take care of her older brother. While watching this happy creature in front of him, Keiki thought to himself, Well. You know, I can't just break her heart like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided to play the role of the older brother until the next morning, when</p>
<p class="null-p">they had planned on leaving the town. That was the mission this time around. The hero now faced his greatest challenge yet after entering this new world.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="null-p">In the town Cherry Boy, after it had been freed from the BL curse. There were people inside the local, worn-down hospital, in one of the personal patient rooms. Kiryuu Keiki lay on the bed, his upper body lifted up. Opposite him was the cute nurse Mizuha-san, who was currently holding a spoon out in his direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, Nii-san. Open wide~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ummm… Mizuha-san. I can feed myself, you know?" "No can do. You're still injured."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, but it's my leg…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The doctor, who had previously been out for a house call, had returned and had tended to Keiki's injury. After he gave Keiki a poultice, he said that Keiki should be back to normal relatively soon if he just rested a bit. Thanks to Mizuha, who still thought Keiki was her older brother, Keiki even got to spend the night for free.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does it taste good?" "It's delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"After you finish eating this, you'll have to take a bath. Since you're still injured, I'll help you clean yourself, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I think I'll pass on that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that this world's Mizuha really liked taking care of others, and was willing to do all sorts of things for Keiki. Making some delicious homemade stew, feeding it to him, and various other things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why would her real older brother just leave her and go into hiding?</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe something had happened to her older brother? Although Keiki had never met him, he couldn't help but be worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, since I keep meeting people that look like people I know from my old world all the time, this really doesn't feel too much like a different world at all…</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, since he'd already run across magic and tentacle monsters, it</p>
<p class="null-p">was kind of too late to doubt that he was in a different world, but Keiki still felt like there were too many look-alikes. Dinner ended while Keiki was contemplating that, and Mizuha spoke up while she took care of the dishes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Nii-san." "What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard this from a patient who came over to visit is this afternoon. Recently, there seems to be an underwear thief who's been going around these parts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"An underwear thief?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Apparently, they've been sneaking into houses night after night, but they only steal used underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of pervert would do that? You'd better be careful, Mizuha." "Ah, um, I think I'll be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course not. Mizuha is a real cutie, so I bet they'd target you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not likely. This underwear thief is actually only stealing male underwear." "…Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's weird, right? Normally it would be the other way around." "I never heard of an underwear thief like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even in Japan, the country of HENTAI, which was the home of all kinds of perverts, a thief who only stole male underwear was unprecedented.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe they're still influenced by Nanjou's brainwashing…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Her magic had the ability to play with a man's vision and feelings, which made members of the same sex look charming beyond belief. The magic even went so far as to even make the men lose their rational thinking and just desire the other party. With this in mind, it wouldn't be too far-fetched for some man to try to steal other men's underwear…</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I'm probably thinking too deeply into it…</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, it seemed like Keiki had to be careful of the underwear thief.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki went to take a bath. Mizuha had tried to tell Keiki that she should help him take his bath, but he politely declined. He took off his clothes in the changing area, carefully washed his hair and body, and gently lowered his body into the hot, steaming water. He had a plastic bag around his right foot so that the bandage wouldn't get wet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I wonder where Lolii went."</p>
<p class="null-p">The holy sword he had received from the Goddess, Lolicon Buster, had misunderstood the relationship between Keiki and Mizuha. He had stepped out of the hospital in order to not be a bother (?), but he still hadn't returned as of yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Lolii will probably be fine on his own, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had the ability to transform his appearance at will, and he was immune to all magical spells. Even though he might look like a small kid.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than that, the current problem is Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As of right now, Keiki was pretending to be Mizuha's older brother for her sake, but deceiving a pure-hearted and kind girl like her wasn't good for Keiki's heart. However, telling her that it was all an act wasn't an option. It would only break her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I have no other choice but to leave the town as quickly as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he felt bad for Mizuha, there was something that Keiki had to accomplish in this world. He had to take care of the last of the demon lord's generals and then take down the big bad himself. Once he fulfilled his promise to the Goddess, he could return to his former world. And the next step for that was to head to the royal capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I should head out now."</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt a bit dizzy after resting in the hot water for too long. After drying off his body, Keiki headed to the changing room to put his clothes on again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hee, hee, hee. Now this is quite the big catch I've landed here!" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside said changing room, a man was holding up Keiki's freshly worn underwear, flashing an evil grin as he inspected it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you've come, you underwear thief!" "Ah, shit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Wait, you're…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon closer inspection, the suspicious man actually looked exactly like Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was utterly confused at the sight of a man who looked exactly like him standing there with his own underwear in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're Mizuha's older brother, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? How do you know about Mizuha? Also, why do you have the exact same</p>
<p class="null-p">face as me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think I'd meet my doppelganger in a situation like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had barely gotten out of the bath, and he had already found his doppelganger, who actually was the underwear thief, and also was the cute nurse Mizuha's older brother-Keiki's head couldn't keep up with the situation anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really know what's happening, but you won't catch me! Ciao!" "Ah, stop right there!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The underwear thief dashed out of the changing room with Keiki's underwear in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shit, a towel, a towel!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to go outside completely naked, Keiki quickly grabbed a towel, wrapped it around his waist, and started chasing after his look-alike. The thief opened the back entrance and ran outside. Quickly putting on some slippers he found, Keiki dashed after him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop right there, you criminal scum!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you serious about this? You're chasing me in that outfit?! Are you some sort of pervert?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to be told that by an underwear-stealing pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a game of tag between one true pervert and one half-naked unwilling pervert. Both of them mysteriously looked exactly the same. Luckily, the streets were empty since it was late at night, but since Keiki was only wearing slippers, his speed dropped more and more, and the distance between the two of them grew.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good… At this rate, I'll lose him!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Getting a new pair of underwear was the least of his problems, but if this underwear thief really was Mizuha's older brother, he definitely had to hear his side of the story-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Hero-dono? Why are you running around while looking like that?" "Lolii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki nearly ran into his trusted partner, who was just walking along the street, eating some yakitori he presumably had just bought at a nearby store.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good timing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what's going on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"An underwear thief appeared! Help me out here!" "O-Okay? I don't really get it, but sure thing, boss!" Lolii quickly transformed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Alright, it's time for a hunt!" "Leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hopped on Lolii's back, and the chase began anew. Though it was a bit surreal, the scene was similar to a common one from many fantasies. A hero riding his shining horse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh, hold on?! A horse?! That's unfair!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how fast they try to run, a human can't beat a horse. Eventually, the male-underwear-specialized thief lost against the horse chasing after him.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, they reached an empty open place inside the town. Lolii and Keiki had tied up the underwear thief, and they made him kneel down on the cold cobblestone road. Keiki was still rocking his own pervert style with only a towel around his waist, but this wasn't the time to care about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's probably useless to ask, but what's your name?" "…Keiki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a coincidence. That's my name, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh… So it's not just our faces. Our names are also the same. What a crazy coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why are you going around stealing male underwear like that? I heard that you've been going around night after night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe that doppelganger of yours loves other men?" Lolii, who had turned back into his human appearance, joined in on the conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a horrible misunderstanding. I'm only interested in girls." "Then why would you do something like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For the demon lord." "What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was asked by the demon lord to gather all this underwear." "Wait, then that means…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm a general of the demon lord."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The underwear thief is actually the 4th general…?" The hero hadn't anticipated that development. "So, the reason you suddenly disappeared…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I started obeying the orders of the demon lord. How could I tell my cute little sister that I'm working for them? All I could do was slip away quietly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see how it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I ask you a question, myself?" "Go ahead?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just a patient at the hospital you snuck into. Mizuha is working there as the head nurse."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously? …I had no idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha's been waiting all this time for you to come back, you know. How about you stop working for the demon lord and go back to your little sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His doppelganger called Mizuha his 'cute little sister'. That meant that he still held great affection for her. And Mizuha clearly treasured her older brother, even after all that. That meant that they could still go back to being normal siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfortunately, I can't." "Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a dream, you see. A dream so big that I left my home to achieve it." "What kind of dream…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, this wasn't good. What he was saying was slowly but steadily turning into a cliché kind of story. The hero hoped that his doppelganger wouldn't bring up anything embarrassing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… And what is your dream?" "A harem!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I get enough underwear for the demon lord, they'll give me a harem of beautiful girls!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was worse than Keiki had expected. "…Lolii."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you turn into a cannon?" "Okay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Using his magic, Lolii transformed into a cannon. It looked like you could fire it with the simple press of a button. Nodding in satisfaction at the result, Keiki walked towards the thief and picked him up. "Hup."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… Guys really are heavy, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on, brother. What are you doing here?" "Do you know the term 'Human Cannon'?" "Wah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki-kun's face went pale when he understood the meaning behind Keiki's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Dude, you're joking, right?" "No, I'm super duper serious~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki flashed a cheerful smile and pushed Keiki-kun into the barrel. "Please, I beg you! Don't do this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Begging won't save you now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing his preparations, Keiki didn't hesitate in the slightest. He gleefully pushed the button on the cannon. When he did, a loud bang sound rang out, followed by-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo?!" The perverted boy flew away into the starry night sky. "He's flying pretty far… Is he going to be alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's one of the demon lord's generals, so he should be able to use magic, right? He probably won't die."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the great hero defeated the last general and saved the town from the underwear thief who had been terrorizing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki got up early in the morning the following day. Without saying goodbye to Mizuha, he got on Lolii, who was in wyvern form, and flew away from Cherry Boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it okay to not tell Mizuha-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. I don't want her to be sad, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">He left behind a letter in the patient's room he had been staying in for the night. It told her about her actual perverted older brother, and he kept it short. 'Your Nii-san is going to defeat the demon lord. By the way, I don't have chuunibyou.' He hoped that this would be enough until her real older brother came back.</p>
<p class="null-p">They soared through the skies for quite a while, and the sun reached its zenith.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon after, Keiki could finally see their final destination. "So this is the royal capital, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. The place where the demon lord is."</p>
<p class="null-p">The head of the evil that was terrorizing this world. Honestly, the generals of the demon lord had turned all the cities where they were into a total mess. The demon lord was probably also making life hell for the poor residents of the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, why would the demon lord want to gather men's underwear like that?" "Who knows? I wouldn't know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Keiki had managed to capture the thief and take back his own underwear, he was unable to get any sort of information out of the thief about why the demon lord wanted underwear in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, since it's the demon lord we're talking about, it must be something dastardly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. No matter what it is, our mission doesn't change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what should we do? Land here and make our way towards the capital?" "We already know where the demon lord is hiding, so let's fly straight to the</p>
<p class="null-p">castle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds good to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lolii flapped his wings, and they started heading directly towards the castle. At this speed, they would get there in a matter of mere minutes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, Lolii." "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for everything. I would have been lost beyond belief if I didn't have you with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolii…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not jinx it right before the final boss?" "Don't say that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, that did sound like a death flag, didn't it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been fighting all this time in order to return to his original world. He had defeated three out of the four generals, and one had surrendered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now if I just defeat the demon lord, the Goddess will resurrect me!</p>
<p class="null-p">Dying by asphyxiation from having his Kouhai's panties being stuffed in his mouth was just way too uncool. He definitely had to come back to life and fully enjoy his youth. In order to achieve that-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, onwards to the final battle!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The enemy's castle was already right in front of them. And all that was left to do was to defeat the demon lord and save the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, Keiki wasn't so foolish as to start a full-frontal attack. If possible, he wanted to sneak inside the place and set up a surprise attack on the demon lord. In order to achieve that, the hero and his partner descended on an open balcony.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like we made it in without being seen, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, but this is where the real mission starts, so don't let your guard down."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lolii turned back into human form. He nodded as he checked their surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like there's nobody close by. Let's get inside from this window." "Aye aye sir!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fortunately, the window didn't have a lock or anything like that, so they managed to sneak inside the building without a hitch. As of now, things were in their favor, so now their next job was to actually figure out the exact location of the demon lord.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I was the demon lord, where would I hide-?" "-You rang?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki turned towards the source of the voice, he found a single girl, with one eye hidden by her bangs. This wasn't the first time Keiki had seen this girl, nor was it even the first time he'd seen her wearing a sailor uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Vice president Fujimoto-san?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Vice president? I'm not a vice president." "Ah, right… It's another doppelganger."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she looked exactly like the student council vice president that Keiki knew, the girl in front of him was nothing more than a girl who looked like Fujimoto Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what's your name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Ayanon. The demon lord Ayanon… okay?" "Ayanon…"</p>
<p class="null-p">What a name… that completely didn't induce any sense of fear or terror. No, first and foremost, why was she wearing a sailor uniform? There were so many things he wanted to ask about, but the most pressing thing was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're… the demon lord?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I am the demon lord Ayanon."</p>
<p class="null-p">She certainly didn't line up with any of the speculations that Keiki had gathered about the big bad demon lord. He had thought that he would have to fight some monster-like beast, but in front of him was nothing but a lone, adorable girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like our surprise attack was a failure, Hero-dono."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it could have been worse, I guess. I mean, I didn't expect to run into you the second we entered the castle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the King's room, after all. Of course I would be here." "Yeah, I guess it does look like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">No wonder the place looked so big. Keiki even spotted a luxurious throne behind the girl. This was truly the most worthy stage for the final battle. While Keiki started to get fired up, the demon lord just tilted her head in confusion. She didn't seem menacing in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So… Who are you two, anyways?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Keiki! I'm the hero who came here to defeat you!" "And I am his trusted partner, the holy sword Lolii!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The hero and his holy sword… So basically, you're my enemies?" "That's what it boils down to, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that's the case, then I won't hold back."</p>
<p class="null-p">The demon lord quietly muttered to herself and pushed her right hand forwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Keiki was wondering what she was planning, an invisible force assaulted him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-dono?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Presumably, it was magic that could control the wind. Since no magic had any effect on Lolii, he could only watch as Keiki took the attack head-on. His body flew into the curtains behind them, through those, and even deeper into the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, he landed on something soft that cushioned his fall, and the pain from hitting his back on the ground wasn't too grave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was scary… if this cushion behind me weren't here, then-Hm?" When he got up, Keiki doubted the scene in front of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha… What's going on here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was, in the most literal sense, a nightmare. It wasn't a soft cushion that had caught the hero's body, but rather a mountain of male underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ahhh, so you found out. Even though I went out of my way to hide it." "Ayanon?! What is this about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is my underwear collection."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I could have guessed as much! Why do you have all of these?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't even begin to fathom how many pairs of underwear he was looking at. When he asked the girl for her reason as to why she had kept this unbelievable amount, her cheeks turned a faint red, and she confessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ayanon likes how boys smell. I had all the boys throughout the capital deliver a pair of used underwear to me like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad, I have no clue what you're saying…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing he understood in the midst of this chaos was that the demon lord in front of him was unbelievably perverted. Just then, another horrifying fact made its way to the forefront of Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was just saved by a mountain of used male underwear…</p>
<p class="null-p">The hero's eyes turned dead, but he quickly caught himself before he was completely lost in the abyss. The final boss was right in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-So that's why you had your own general steal underwear like that…" "I was after the best-smelling ones, so I figured I'd get a lot of samples." "Oh my lord…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the demon lord was really just a smell fetishist…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Lolii was unable to hide his shock from the sudden revelation. However, the person in question didn't pay any heed to their reaction. She just picked a pair of underwear off the ground and gave it a sniff.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, this is the pair I stole this morning from the knight in the castle."</p>
<p class="null-p">Brazenly announcing the crime she had committed, she gazed at the underwear like it was her lover, shoved her nose into it, and took a deep sniff.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniff sniff… Haaah… What a great smell. So sweet, luscious, and rich… it makes me so excited."</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Um… Ayanon… san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The demon lord just continued to sniff the underwear, her facial expression distorting in pleasure. But, soon after, her expression turned into one of sorrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This… isn't the smell I'm looking for. Even after gathering so many pairs of underwear, I've been unable to encounter my one and only perfect smell…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why-I'll have to check the smell of Hero-san's underwear as well." She dropped the underwear in her hands and pointed one hand towards Keiki. This isn't good! Is she going to hit me with another one of those attacks?!</p>
<p class="null-p">It was going to be the same wind magic that had sent Keiki flying just earlier. "Lolii!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But as he called the holy sword to his defense- "I won't let you get in the way."</p>
<p class="null-p">The demon lord acted first. She moved her hand like a conductor of an orchestra, and the curtains that Keiki had flown through a second ago suddenly started moving. They wrapped themselves around Lolii's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah?! I can't move?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"L-Lolii?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just learned that direct magic doesn't work against work him. But as long as the magic isn't directed at him specifically, it should work, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was right that Lolii's anti-magic ability wouldn't activate under these circumstances. That was why the demon lord used wind magic to prevent Lolii from moving like this. Just from a single observation, she had been able to see through his powers and think of a way to counter them-That's the demon lord for you. She was on a completely different level from her generals.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-san, don't just space out like that!" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've used my wind magic to restrict your movement." "When did you-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was busy admiring her strength, shackles made out of wind had appeared around his hands and feet. No matter how much he tried to break them apart, it was to no avail. While he was restrained, the demon lord approached him, smiling. Abruptly, she crouched down in front of him and put her hands on his pants.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha?! W-What are you planning on doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry, leave it all to Ayanon. I'll strip you gently." "Nooooooo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she was trying to pull off his pants, our hero let out a maiden-like scream. He didn't want his little son to be revealed to anyone other than his future lover. But now that he couldn't move an inch, he could only watch it happen in front of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Resigning himself to his fate, Keiki stopped resisting, and just looked down at the scene happening, despair flowing from his expression. Just then-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will protect Hero-dono's chastity!" "Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A medium-sized dog suddenly leaped at Ayanon. "A-A dog? From where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolii!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The demon lord was taken by surprise, and Keiki immediately realized that his saviour was in fact Lolii, who had changed into the appearance of a dog.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… So even if you can't deflect the magic, your transformation ability still works…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am the holy sword, after all. Now then, Hero-dono, how about we finish this? Let's punish her so that she doesn't even think of doing anything evil ever again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that sounds good. For now, strip her of her panties." "Got it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Earnestly obeying the hero's order, the dog-form Lolii dashed towards Ayanon's lower half and stuffed his face beneath her skirt. Then, once he got a good bite on it, he ripped off her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noooooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having lost her last defense beneath her skirt, the demon lord crouched down on the spot. At the same time, the wind shackles that had been restraining Keiki disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-sama, I have brought the spoils of war," said the dog Lolii, a pair of pure white panties in his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well done, Lolii."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What are you planning on doing with my panties?" "Now, I wonder. What will you do, Hero-dono?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well well well, there's only one thing to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, what would be the best way to punish this pervert? "You do something like this!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He held the white panties up in front of him and shoved his nose against the fabric. And then, he took a deep, deep sniff of the girl's freshly worn panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiff" "Nooooooooooooo?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the perverted hero took a deep whiff of her panties, Ayanon let out a girly shriek. The fun had just started, but she had already been brought to tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Stop, this is too embarrassing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Embarrassing? Weren't you enjoying yourself while you were embarrassing other people? And now you complain when it's being done to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet again, Keiki took a good whiff.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… You probably took a morning shower, I can't smell much of anything but soap… No, there's also a bit of sweat mixed in there… I have to check a bit more… Sniff sniff sniff!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… I'm being sniffed… My own smell is being sniffed by a boy I just met…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The demon lord's face was as red as a tomato. Even so, the hero didn't stop just yet. He was busy enjoying the sweet scent of a girl's freshly worn panties while standing right in front of her. At first glance, this looked nothing more than sexual harassment. Just as Lolii had said, Keiki decided to punish the demon lord Ayanon to such an extent that she wouldn't dare do this to someone else again. If he made her feel the embarrassment that other people had to go through, she should stop gathering underwear from other people like this. If that succeeded, nobody had to live in fear of the demon lord again. Or in other worlds, the world would be saved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuahahahahaha! Marvelous! What a sweet-smelling scent!" "S-Stop it already!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really can't tell who the bad guy is here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lolii, who had turned back into his human form, showed a bitter smile. A young man, was taking deep whiffs of a girl's panties, and said girl was screaming 'Stop!' at him with tears in her eyes. No matter how you looked at it, the hero was clearly more worthy of being called the demon lord. The King's room was filled with chaos. The hero was so focused on punishing the demon lord that he didn't realize that a few other people had appeared in the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hero-senpai?" "…Hero-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hero?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was called back to reality by voices cold as ice, and he spotted people who were familiar to him. The three generals of the demon lord, Yuika, Sayuki, and Nanjou, were there, as well as the nurse from Cherry Boy, Mizuha. They were all glaring at him in contempt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why are you all here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They all ignored the hero's desperate question, and just glared at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you have a masochistic maid like me, you're going around sniffing other pigs' panties like that! Hero-kun, you're not qualified to be my master!" Sayuki responded with an equally crazy comment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sniffing panties that don't belong to your little sister… Nii-san, you cheater…!" Mizuha brought weirdly believable logic to the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not allowed to play with anyone's panties but Lolii-kun, okay?!" The BL fanatic Nanjou had a one-track mind as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you like panties that much, Yuika and the others wouldn't mind feeding you some?" Yuika flashed a devilish smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan, what are you saying?!" "Agreed!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">To Keiki's shock and despair, the other three girls agreed with Yuika's nightmarish idea. And then, all the girls suddenly started to take off their panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hero-dono… I don't really get it, but aren't we in quite a pinch right now?" "Y-Yeah… It's time for a strategic retreat."</p>
<p class="null-p">The demon lord's punishment had been done already. After having gone through this amount of embarrassment, she was just cowering on the ground, not paying attention to her surroundings. She surely would never do anything bad in her life ever again. Now he just had to live through the aftermath, and his mission would be a success.</p>
<p class="null-p">It'll be fine. We've managed to make it through all kinds of challenges and dangers up until now. We'll overcome this pinch as well!</p>
<p class="null-p">Stealthy footsteps… stealthy steps… soft steps. Holding his breath, he tried to sneak away, but-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't let you get away!" "Uwah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki used her magic to freeze the ground beneath Keiki, which made him fall on his butt. Immediately after, he was surrounded by the four girls, all of them with panties in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero-senpai…" "Hero-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hero…" "Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eat up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then they all pushed their panties into his mouth at the same time. His mouth was filled with soft fabric, and he frantically tried to scream, but only muffled groans came out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mugh?! Mughughughguh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">F-Four at the same time?! I can't breathe!</p>
<p class="null-p">Just the one pair from Koga Yuika had caused him to die by asphyxiation. Naturally, when three more were added to that number, he found himself unable to breathe anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back on it, a lot has happened since I came to this world…</p>
<p class="null-p">He had met a goddess with the appearance of a grade school girl, and promised her that he would defeat the demon lord and be revived. Then, in this other world, he had gone on to defeat all demon lord generals with his newfound partner, the holy sword Lolii. First he had freed a town from Yuika's enslavement, then he had rescued Sayuki, who was being assaulted by lewd tentacles. After that, they took down Nanjou, who was controlling a city with brainwashing magic in order to gather BL material, and then they had launched away the Keiki look-alike who was stealing male underwear in order to build his own harem. Finally, they had even managed to best the demon lord, Ayanon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it was a tough battle, I managed to save this world…</p>
<p class="null-p">The hero had managed to bring peace back to the world, just as the goddess had ordered him to. Thus, his role was fulfilled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks for everything, Lolii. And goodbye, this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's last thoughts were words of gratitude and parting. And then, he lost consciousness completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">* "………Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened his eyes, he found himself in the nurse's office of his school. The setting sun illuminated the interior of the room, and Keiki was lying on a bed while trying desperately to remember what had happened that got him here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… I was force-fed panties in the library storage room…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had received an abnormal confession from his kouhai Yuika in said storage room, she had stuffed her panties into his mouth, and he had lost consciousness. He felt like he had been dreaming about something else just a moment ago, but he couldn't remember what.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you're awake?" "Tachibana-sensei?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he lifted his body, a rather sexy and arousing nurse, Tachibana Kaori, walked towards the side of his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How are you feeling?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes, there seems to be no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear it. Also, Kiryuu-kun, I heard from Koga-san~ She confessed to you, and you collapsed on the spot out of happiness, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not bad, not bad. You're a lucky guy for a beauty like her to confess to you." "Ahhh, so that's what happened…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Yuika had kept quiet about the real reason why Keiki had lost consciousness. Well, the confession part was true, but it wasn't the bittersweet, youthful kind of love like the nurse suspected. Instead, it was a request for Keiki to become her slave. It was an abnormal wish through and through. Also, he had rejected her confession, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, Tachibana-sensei?" "What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you give me some psychotherapy drugs?" "Psychotherapy?! Why would a young boy like you need that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Keiki's memory was hazy, he faintly remembered being fed several pairs of panties in a dream, and ended up unconscious because of asphyxiation caused by panties stuffed in his mouth. This developed into quite a trauma. As a side note, Tachibana-sensei was never able to cure that trauma.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">For this short Hensuki episode, I wanted to write something that I could have never put in the main series, so I decided to make it an Isekai adventure. Did you enjoy it?</p>
<p class="null-p">When it comes to Isekai, there has to be a reincarnated protagonist. When it comes to Isekai, there has to be a cute Goddess.</p>
<p class="null-p">When it comes to Isekai, there has to be a cheat-like, overpowered holy sword. When it comes to Isekai, there have to be clothes-melting tentacles.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so on, but the most important things to add here were of course the Hensuki typical perverted heroines, and still making them the focus of everything. The scene I personally enjoyed the most was the very first scene with the Goddess. Their conversation was so calm and soothing, almost fluffy, with no tension at all. That might be similar to the original source, but there, Koharu- senpai acts more like a guide, like an important person for moving the story forward. She gives crucial information to Keiki for his Cinderella investigation and cheers him up with supportive words. Taking that into consideration, I thought that giving her the role of the Goddess was fitting.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now, the scene I should mention lastly is the tentacle + maid Sayuki scene. The beauty is assaulted by grotesque tentacles, and her clothes slowly melt away from the acid. Really, if this isn't Isekai at it's best, then I don't know what is (Personal opinion). And of course, this kind of scene couldn't have fit anyone any better than the masochistic Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">I made a small checklist about what would need to be in an Isekai, now we have fight scenes using magic, a dragon-flight scene, the aforementioned tentacle scene, and many more. Sadly, since this is nothing but a short Isekai episode, there were many things I couldn't write about, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, we still have the typical Hensuki scenes. Asking the protagonist to become one's master, being forced to eat panties… It was a lot of fun to add them in a fantasy setting (LOL). If I ever get another chance, I would love to write</p>
<p class="null-p">something like this again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, since I've filled my pages, it is time to let even this afterword come to an end. Thank you all for reading, and I hope that we can meet each other again.</p>
