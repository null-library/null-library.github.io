<p class="null-p">"-Hey, Keiki-kun, wake up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn…? Eh, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt his shoulders shaking, and slowly opened his eyes to find a black-haired beauty in front of him. She was wearing a white blouse with a red ribbon on top and a long skirt, which gave her a very adult look. Sayuki softly smiled at Keiki. The location was his own living room, and the time was already past midnight. It seemed like he had fallen asleep on the couch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Sayuki-senpai at my house?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, are you still half-asleep? I'm not your Senpai anymore, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… that's right. We're married after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, the day when Keiki and Sayuki went on a date at the amusement park, Keiki had taken responsibility for shaming Sayuki like that, and they had started going out. After Keiki graduated, they got married. Now the girl's name wasn't Tokihara Sayuki, but Kiryuu Sayuki. Their Senpai ‐ Kouhai relationship was now completely gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. It seems like Keiki-kun is tired. You're really giving it your all, always working like this," She looked at him with an expectant gaze. "Tomorrow is a free day… so it should be fine, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. Come here, Sayuki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes," She happily sat down in front of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">She slightly lifted up her long hair so that Keiki could put a bright red collar around her neck, which caused Sayuki to smile a bewitching smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, when Master puts it on for me, I'm so happy."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_6.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"You really are a pervert, getting excited by this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhn, don't tease me like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you like it when I tease you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah. Ehehe, I love it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's go for our nightly walk. I hope that no one sees you while you're crouching on all fours."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I'm so happy. So happy, Master!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The hardcore masochistic wife with the collar around her neck, and the hardcore sadistic husband with the leash in his hand. Like this, the perverted married couple's nightly walk began.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Woahhhhhhhhhhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki jolted upright.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah… Haaah… H-Huh? T-This is…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at his surroundings, he realized that he was in his own room. Realizing that everything that just happened was merely a dream, he let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was cloooooose… Thank God it was a dream…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The dream was so realistic that he thought he'd actually gone down the Sayuki route, but it seemed like he was still safe from that. Checking the time on his clock, it was a bit before 7:00 am. He had woken up a bit earlier than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What a terrible dream that was."</p>
<p class="null-p">A dream where he had become his masochistic Senpai's owner, and they did a dog walk roleplay late at night. Keiki was still horrified because of the</p>
<p class="null-p">hideous contents of the dream. If he could, he'd really like to avoid that future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see. I went on a date yesterday with Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The previous day was a Sunday, and in order to find out if Sayuki was his Cinderella, he invited her on an amusement park date. And a particular accident had happened on their way home. In a deserted park with dim light, Keiki found out that the girl had been wearing no panties the whole day. Because Sayuki had seemed conscious about her skirt during the date, Keiki thought that she might be hiding the fact that she was wearing Cinderella's panties. So Keiki, as her master for the day, had ordered her to lift up her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">The result? Sayuki wasn't wearing Cinderella's panties. Even worse, she was wearing no panties at all, getting an exhibisionistic thrill out of the very thought of being seen like that. This Cinderella candidate was a hardcore masochist.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that incident, Sayuki asked an embarrassed "What should we do after this?" Keiki's response was simple. He took the girl's hand and escorted her home. To be honest, he was really shocked by the whole no-panties thing, and there were moments when he just wanted to run away, but there was no way that he could leave a girl alone in a park at that hour. They didn't speak a single word during their trip to her house, and nothing major happened. After Keiki brought her home, he returned to his own house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, I still didn't find out if Sayuki is Cinderella or not."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Cinderella who dropped her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who wrote an anonymous love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Sayuki was still the leading candidate, Keiki had yet to find any definite proof.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I even say to Sayuki-senpai when I see her at school?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he hadn't known that she had no panties on, he had still ordered her to lift up her skirt, only to see her naked below her belly button. Though the dim electric light hid his view a bit, Keiki's face still burned up every time he remembered it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, going no-panties for a whole day is totally crazy, don't you think…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't like it was a picture or on the Internet; he had seen it in person right in front of him. The impact on a virgin like him was just too strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… Sayuki-senpai still looked really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">The sight wasn't too bad, he thought, recallingher bright red face and shivering hands as she lifted up her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wait, doesn't this make me a complete pervert as well?" He hurriedly shook off that sadistic thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being her master was supposed to be a one-day-only experience. He was Sayuki's owner no more. And while he was trying to return his mind to reality, he heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, are you awake?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The door opened slightly, and the face of the girl whom Keiki loved the most in the entire world peeked into the room. Wearing an apron, and sporting shoulder-length hair, it was his little sister Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you're awake. Good morning, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning. The sight of Mizuha wearing an apron should be treasured as the cutest world heritage ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. I see that you're as much of a siscon as ever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think your beloved Nii-san is about to fall asleep again, so could you gently wake him up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll pass. I'm not that much of a brocon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you change your clothes and wash your face? Breakfast is ready."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood… Ah, Mizuha. Wait a second."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? What is it?" Mizuha was almost out of the room as she stopped and turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a question. Mizuha, uhm… have you ever… gone out of the house without wearing panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I just wondered if there were days when girls would walk around with no panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's absolutely no way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might not be okay…" After all, he had started his day by sexually harassing his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This is a story about my friend. That guy, uhm, he saw the most embarrassing place for a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, he basically saw her naked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, yeah. Something like that. In that case, how should the boy take responsibility?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm……… How about marriage?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Marriage?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As that word left his little sister's mouth, Keiki felt himself reliving the nightmare from before. That they would marry, and lived a newlywed lifestyle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't tell me… Will that dream come true…?</p>
<p class="null-p">That would mean that the future had already been decided, and he had already gone down the Master-route.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just joking about the whole marriage thing. Shouldn't the boy just apologize?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, if something of this calibre were to happen between a boy and a girl, the boy would be the one to apologize.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like accidentally seeing her while she was changing, or happening to see her panties. Man, boys really have it hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess… I'll go to school."</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem wouldn't solve itself if he were to run away. Keiki's goal was still to find the Cinderella who dropped her panties. But since there had been that incident with the most promising candidate Sayuki, he had to clear that up first before he could continue his investigation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bring out Cinderella, and Keiki's dream of getting a girlfriend would finally come true. This wasn't the time to hesitate because of his no-panties Senpai.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: No Panties No Life</p>
<p class="null-p">After putting on his indoor school shoes, Keiki was headed to his classroom when he ran into the one person he wanted to avoid the most.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a Senpai one year above Keiki and the club president of the calligraphy club that he was a member of. More importantly, she was the perverted girl hadn't worn any panties on their date the day before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"G-Good morning, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After they finished greeting each other, they just stood there in awkward silence. With slightly flushed cheeks, Sayuki looked up at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?" Keiki responded with an embarrassed look on his face when the girl struck up a conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's about yesterday, but… uhm, going on a date without panties… is pretty indecent, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I got back home and finally calmed down a bit, I realized that I had done something incredibly disgraceful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really wish that you'd realized that earlier."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It did feel really good, but I'll stop from going without panties for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really wish that you'd stop that for all eternity."</p>
<p class="null-p">Everytime Keiki's eyes met Sayuki's, he started wondering She's wearing panties now, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">No Panties No life.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to spend a calm and relaxing daily life, wearing panties was an absolute must. That being said, this idiotic exchange with Sayuki helped Keiki relax a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And I really gave it some thought yesterday. I completely understand now," Sayuri said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really do understand. Keiki-kun's feelings, that is. It felt like a blindfold had been taken off of my eyes. As an obedient pet, I have to be prepared to understand the intentions behind what my master wants."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai? What are you saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, that's… L-Let's talk after school about it, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ok… Let's do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could only watch Sayuki's back as she walked away quickly. Though her words were indeed filled with mystery, that was always the case for Sayuki. Keiki decided to stop worrying about it, since that would only cause him to suffer from overthinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine. I'll leave that worry to my future self."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it was a bit awkward, their conversation ended like that. Once they had managed to put this incident behind them, though, Keiki was going to continue his Cinderella investigation. Or at least he thought so, but reality wasn't always that accommodating. From the get-go, it didn't quite pan out how Keiki thought it would.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day after classes, three figures could be seen inside the calligraphy clubroom. Keiki and Yuika were sitting at the table, facing each other, while Sayuki was sitting on a tatami mat, quietly painting the white paper in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The year had already entered its 7th month, and in order to counter the summer heat they had opened a window, which filled the room with a soothing breeze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki, who was currently working, had her black hair in a ponytail, which revealed her snow white neck. He was just spacing out staring at her, but every time their eyes met, Sayuki hurriedly looked down again. And her cheeks were probably not flushed from the heat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started feeling a bit bad about it, so he focused his gaze on the window. The atmosphere between the two of them was still just as awkward as before. They both tried to not be overly conscious of one another, which caused the complete opposite to occur. The third person inside the room noticed their awkwardness and opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, did something happen between you and Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai is completely spacing out, and Witch-senpai isn't able to focus at all. It's pretty obvious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though they had talked a bit this morning, you couldn't exactly call the</p>
<p class="null-p">current atmosphere pleasant. There was no way that Yuika wouldn't notice that. Still, they couldn't exactly tell her about the no-panties incident, so they had to cover it up some way or another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not the case…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yesh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That didn't sound very convincing… Something's fishy," Yuika narrowed her eyes like a cop glaring at a suspicious man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her gemstone-like eyes looked like they could see through Keiki with ease.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… It doesn't matter. Yuika will just ask Witch-senpai instead," Said the cute inspector.</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing up, she went towards the tatami mat Sayuki was sitting on, and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can Yuika have some time, Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Ah, yeah. What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something happen with Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu…" Hearing Yuika's direct question, Sayuki's cheeks went red in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">She started fidgeting, and glanced at Keiki several times. Then-</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Something like that… There's no way I could say it out loud because it's so embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">She blurted out a phrase that basically proved that something had happened. Hearing this, Yuika looked even more displeased.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Somehow, this makes it sound like you're both guilty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guilty?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kouhai's doubt towards her Senpai had only grown. That being said, fessing up was out of the question, which is why he tried to get away by averting his gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it doesn't matter. There's something that Yuika wants Keiki-senpai to see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika took a math workbook out of her bag. Moving next to Keiki, she opened up the book to a certain page and pointed at a certain problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika isn't very good with math. Do you understand this problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, you just have to factorize the formula here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Borrowing Yuika's pen, Keiki started writing in the workbook.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it gets a bit messy, so you have to put the coefficients in order… Like this. See, now you can use this formula instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that makes sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't get an answer, then your way of solving it might be wrong, or the formula in general doesn't work, and you need a different one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, Keiki-senpai looks like a senpai now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I technically am your senpai, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It might just be by one year, but he indeed was a student older than her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, since we have finals next week, can you help me with my math studies until then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why don't you ask Sayuki-senpai to teach you? She's much better at it than me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is afraid of what Witch-senpai may ask for in return."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what kind of low opinion do you have of Sayuki-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai forced Yuika to wear a bunny girl outfit in return for allowing her to join the club, remember?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">The adorable photo he had taken of her that day was still stored safely on Keiki's phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was a quarter Western, and a blonde-haired beauty. With a small stature, she always looked cute, and Keiki often had to hold back from just hugging her out of reflex. And Keiki understood what it meant to be forced to wear a bunny girl suit. It seemed like the desire to make cute girls wear cute clothes was the same for both genders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That story doesn't matter right now, so please teach Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it, okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. A slave should just listen to his master's orders."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you stop saying such terrible things with such a wonderful smile?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At first glance, she looked like an angel, but she actually was a hardcore sadistic devilish girl. That was Yuika's real identity.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then adjusted her chair to sit even closer to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, let's start studying for the test."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, Yuika-chan? Aren't you a bit too close?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? There's no way that's the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">Impossible. They were so close that their shoulders were almost touching. But Yuika didn't pay any attention to it and started earnestly studying. In the</p>
<p class="null-p">end, Keiki gave up on resisting her and focused on his own studies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muuu…" Sayuki looked at the two of them and pouted like a dog whose owner wasn't giving them enough attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even though she stared at them, she didn't do anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh? Weird. Normally, Sayuki-senpai would immediately try to separate us…</p>
<p class="null-p">The normal Sayuki would immediately insult Yuika's small chest or something like that. But it didn't seem like she was planning on doing that currently. On the contrary, she simply returned to her work. Even Yuika realized that this was abnormal behaviour.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Somehow, Witch-senpai is really acting weird. She did glance at us, but she's just endlessly writing 'Patience' on her paper. Really small, too; as small as a grain of rice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, that sounds really scary…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it was true that Sayuki was acting weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it's because of what happened yesterday…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, is it really fine to leave Witch-senpai alone like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's a bit weird between us. Something like an accident happened, you could say…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So something happened after all…" She looked at Keiki, pouting, only to change her expression into a teasing smile the very next second. "Well then, let's test this a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How long Witch-senpai can hold… back," Saying that, Yuika clung to Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">While her sweet smell was filling his nose, she started rubbing her head on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Yuika appreciates that wonderful reaction."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, what exactly are you doing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"An experiment. Yuika wants to find out how long the jealous Witch-senpai can hold back. Though Yuika really doesn't think that bitch can hold back very long when someone's trying to steal her owner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what you would expect from a hardcore sadist… Knowing exactly what Sayuki-senpai would hate…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once, Sayuki had shown jealousy towards Keiki and the vice president of the student council getting intimate. Like a dog who was afraid of losing her owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder if she is going to be able to hold back?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmm… Witch-senpai isn't moving at all. She's actually pretty stubborn."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But she keeps glancing at us…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she clearly was interested with what was going on between Keiki and Yuika, she didn't utter a single word, and continued to sit there without moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… Yuika didn't expect her to hold back this much… Then, we have to raise the level a bit. Keiki-senpai, excuse Yuika for a second."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Wai-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Keiki was wondering what she was about to do, Yuika stood up from her seat and sat down on Keiki's lap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha. You can't do something like this with someone like Witch-senpai, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well yeah, Yuika-chan's body is a lot more compact…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl with the small stature who was sitting on his thighs seemed to be in a good mood. With an even closer smell of her and her soft feeling on his legs, Keiki had to give his very best right now. Why? If his crotch were to show a reaction in this situation, he would surely be branded as a pervert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, let's check for Witch-senpai's reaction."</p>
<p class="null-p">The 'witch-senpai,' Tokihara Sayuki, looked over at them with a lonely expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sayuki-senpai looks like she has tears in her eyes, doesn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, she's probably about to cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started to feel pity for Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To think that she still isn't getting mad at us. This is the perfect time to pay her back, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouldn't we stop now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was the type to hold a grudge. Just thinking about the payback for this payback made Keiki shudder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-senpai, you really are too kind towards Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has to discipline Keiki-senpai for being kind to girls other than her," With these words, she turned her small body around and kissed Keiki on the cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of this sudden action, he felt his head suddenly burn up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, ahhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Senpai, don't move like that-Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The virgin boy started to panic, which resulted in the chair falling over. Though Keiki wanted to move away as fast as he could, the blue diamond-like eyes in front of him prevented that. As their eyes met, both of their faces turned red.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The door opened, and a female student with brownish-red hair in a side tail entered. It was Keiki's classmate, the popular BL mangaka Nanjou Mao. Mao stopped and stared at the couple with cold eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You guys… what are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… Studying for tests?" Keiki offered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Physical education?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of studying makes you end up in that position?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I want to know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… This would be an ideal situation if Yuika were a beautiful dude…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please keep such thoughts in the afterword of your doujinshi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as always, all of the calligraphy club members were complete perverts.</p>
<p class="null-p">While standing up, Yuika gently rubbed her butt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if it's Keiki-senpai… T-The butt is a no-go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu. Even Yuika is tainted by BL. It seems like it was worth gifting her the complete series of my work!" Mao smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you do that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Keiki, Yuika's hardcore sadism was already quite difficult to handle. What would happen if she ended up becoming a fujoshi as well? He really wished that Mao would hold back on gaining new fans like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, like that, the hardcore masochist, sadist, and the fujoshi had all gathered together. And, when Keiki looked over at Sayuki, she had returned to her work. Inside this lively clubroom, only Sayuki seemed like an adult. And the fact that Keiki continued to only gaze at Sayuki wasn't lost on Yuika either.</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, and even the day after, Sayuki still kept acting weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's wasn't like they had a fight and were avoiding each other, but they still didn't exchange many words. Sayuki for her part just kept working on her calligraphy and didn't show any interest in joining the conversation of the other club members.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she seemed to be jealous while Keiki was helping Yuika's studies, she couldn't strike a conversation with him, probably because she still felt weird about the no-panties incident. And like that, without being able to solve the problem, time passed. It was now after classes on a Thursday. Keiki was sitting alone in an empty classroom, muttering something to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something really is wrong with Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a time before when the two of them had an awkward atmosphere and were unable to properly talk with each other. But this time, they couldn't find the right words to repair their relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe I should ask Koharu-senpai for advice…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He decided to give up on worrying alone. With that in mind, he made his way to the astronomy club on the third floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me…… Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he entered, the sight that greeted him completely robbed him of his words. Though there were still pictures of Shouma on the walls, that wasn't exactly it. Inside the astronomy club room, Akiyama Shouma was pushing down a small girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three of them were silent for a moment. In this unpleasant situation, Keiki was the first one to take action by taking out his phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuhm, what's the number for the police again…?"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_7.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Can you please not call the police?!" Shouma hurriedly stopped Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, you know, I wanted to stop this before we'd have to go to court."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How rude! I'm aiming to be a clean lolicon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell is a clean lolicon…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't it bad the moment you start liking smaller girls…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, you're completely wrong about this. I wasn't attacking Koharu-chan or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's right. He went to catch me when I fell over," The girl who slowly stood up - Ootori Koharu - said as she stepped forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl, wearing an out-of-season hoodie, was about 145cm tall, and even with that small stature, she was actually a 3rd year student, a senpai of Keiki and Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, right. It's just as Koharu-chan says. I didn't have any ulterior motive or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? So Shouma, you're saying that you have absolutely no interest in Koharu-senpai? After being so close, you haven't thought once of going hasuhasu at Koharu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hasuhasu? Don't take me for a fool - of course I want to do that all the time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's plenty enough ulterior motive for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what you would expect from a schooled lolicon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly is this 'hasuhasu'?" Koharu tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hasuhasu means that he gets excited while sniffing you-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Keiki's explanation, her face went as red as a ripe tomato.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, even if it doesn't look like it, Koharu-senpai is older than us. I don't care of you sniff her or lick her or whatever… but… she does look like a gradeschooler…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Grade school…" Loli-senpai grumbled and put her hands on her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Shouma wholeheartedly smiled at Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry about it. You're plenty cute just the way you are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun… I'm happy…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… I'm glad that you two seem to be so close, but can you keep the flirting for when it's just the two of you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a girlfriend-less virgin, the atmosphere was a bit too much to handle. Though Shouma and Koharu aren't exactly dating, they often went on dates, and they really looked like a couple. Keiki could barely hold back the phrase "Normies should just explode".</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Kiryuu-kun, why did you come here? Is it about Cinderella?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it is related to that… Recently, my relationship with Sayuki-senpai has become a bit awkward, so I wanted to ask Koharu-senpai for some advice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something happen with Tokihara-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He reported what had happened on their date. In great detail, at that. About what had happened at the amusement park, their conversation on the way home, and of course, the no-panties accident.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-I see. A no-panties date, huh? Tokihara-san really is bold. I would be way too embarrassed to do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A vast majority of people would agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">As a side note, Koharu and Sayuki had gotten acquainted when they were in the same class during their first year. Even at that point, they were already complete opposites. It was really hard to believe that they were in the same grade.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And since that date, Sayuki-senpai has been acting weird. She seems like she's oddly docile, and very modest. She wouldn't even go along with Yuika-chan's provocations."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were still studying together, and during these times, Yuika would always try to get some sort of reaction out of Sayuki, only to be disappointed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels very awkward for me as well. Sometimes I think that she's still mad that I forced her to do that, but sometimes it looks like she doesn't care about it anymore. She's not even teasing me anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe - you're just lonely? You want to get attention from Tokihara-san, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, it seems like Kiryuu-kun really likes Tokihara-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, they've been all alone in the club room for almost a year now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma as well?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both the senpai and his classmate couldn't keep from grinning. For him, it felt like the two of them were reading his innermost thoughts, making him feel embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki was always in a good mood, and she loved to tease her Kouhai while she gleefully laughed, so of course Keiki would like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun, you're quite the spoiled kid I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please take it easy on me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But we still don't know why she's suddenly not that lively anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe Keiki did something? Like peeked on her while she changed, or stole her panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just who do you think I am? And, even if I did that, she'd only be happy about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, Sayuki is a hardcore masochist. To her, sexual harassment is a reward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, shouldn't you already have an answer for what you should do?" Shouma asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I also think so," Koharu agreed to his words with a smile. "I think the problem at hand is what Kiryuu-kun wants to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What I want to do…"</p>
<p class="null-p">What does Kiryuu Keiki want to do?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki doesn't like the calm, composed Sayuki. He liked the Sayuki who was lively, who liked to play pranks on her Kouhai and tease him with a beautiful smile. He couldn't let her stay like this. He wanted to see her smile. Because he had given it too much thought, he hadn't been able to find that simple answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the moment Keiki found that answer, he jolted up from his seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm - going to talk to Sayuki-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the astronomy club room behind him, Keiki hurried towards the calligraphy club room. He went down the stairs and put his hand on the door of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uh? It's locked? Did she say that there wouldn't be any club activities?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he took out his smartphone to check, he heard the movement of someone past the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're in there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Wait a moment, I'll open it up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as she said, Keiki heard the sound of the door unlocking. And, the moment he set foot into the room, he was pushed down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The cold feeling of the floor on his back, and the warm body temperature of another human on his belly. As silence returned to the room, the senpai sat on top of her kouhai and looked down at him with flushed cheeks and watery eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai?! What are you doing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't anymore… I tried to hold back for Keiki-kun, but I can't do it anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recently, Keiki-kun has been all over Koga-san. You've only been kind to her, and completely ignored me… so cruel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I didn't mean to do that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But he couldn't deny the fact that he had spent much more time studying with Yuika. It was a small wonder that Sayuki had picked up on that as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san is small and cute after all. For the lolicon Keiki-kun, she's like the forbidden fruit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a lolicon. Not a lolicon at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">He emphasized the important part. He really didn't want to be put into the same group as his perverted friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. You did a 'Suspense play' right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Suspense… play?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The words she blurted out weren't used in daily conversations, which was why Keiki was a bit taken aback.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a moment, please. Let me get this clear. What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Keiki-kun. After our date, we went home like nothing happened. I was prepared to get punished with a spanking, at the very least. No, I was hoping for it. But instead, you just brought me home and left. Thanks to that, I was left behind with all these unfulfilled desires."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And at that time, I realized. You were doing a suspense play."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would it ever end up like that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, you made me get my hopes up, only to let me down like that. And it's the same with Koga-san. You only look at her. Like that you make me jealous, and enjoy watching me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what I would expect from Master. You find the best way to play with a young maiden's heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm telling you that you're wrong! I didn't do it with that in mind!"</p>
<p class="null-p">For Keiki, it felt like they were talking past each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, the reason that Sayuki-senpai was so weird recently is because you thought I was doing this… suspense play…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I feel like all my worrying was for nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really felt like a dog these past few days. At first, this kind of neglect actually felt good. But, after some time, my chest started to hurt, and I wasn't happy at all anymore. That's why I wanted to get a monopoly on Keiki-kun again. To make sure that the others wouldn't interfere, I told them that there wouldn't be any club activities today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's why the door was locked…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun? I really held back, you know. I won't forgive you if you don't give me a fitting reward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-A reward…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty simple. I want you to slap me on my butt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu… Then, for now, I'll fluff Keiki-kun until I'm satisfied. And I'll have Keiki-kun pat me on the head."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, prepare yourself. I'll make sure to get a lot of love from you today."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Keiki-kun continued to lay on the ground while being hugged by Sayuki, and simultaneously patted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu, now I'm satisfied."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having been freed from Sayuki, Keiki stood up and cleaned his uniform from any remaining dust. But he had finally found out the reason why Sayuki was acting weird, so at least that problem was gone. That meant that he could continue his Cinderella investigation. The true identity of the person who had sent him the love letter. But, as it stood now, Sayuki, the most prominent candidate, didn't show any signs of revealing herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me get straight to the point. Did Sayuki-senpai steal the panties from my room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A double-edged question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, if she really is Cinderella, I don't think she'll confess that easily-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yes. I can't help it now that it's out," But Sayuki gave an unexpectedly honest answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? It really was Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I'm the one that stole the underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While awkwardly averting her eyes, the girl confirmed that she was indeed the criminal. Keiki started to get excited, thinking that Sayuki was actually his Cinderella-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even today, I'm wearing that exact underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the girl declared these words, she stepped in front of the boy and slowly lifted up her skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-, Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started having PTSD from the no-panties incident, and was about to avert his eyes. But, let's just say that she was indeed wearing panties - or as they're more commonly known, underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing underwear, but not a girl's. Indeed, she was wearing a boy's boxers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Boxers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Amber-colored boxers, unmistakably a boy's underwear. And for some reason, Keiki thought that they looked oddly familiar, like he was seeing an old classmate again-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait! Those are mine, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, they indeed belonged to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why? What? Why does Sayuki-senpai have my boxers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was just a sudden impulse. I happened to spot them while I was searching for porn magazines. I knew that I shouldn't do it, but I couldn't win against my curiosity."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What kind of things are you doing in another person's room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wearing a boy's underwear like this is strangely exciting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pervert?! You're a pervert aren't you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, these harsh worlds feel so good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person is just…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though they were speaking the same language, they couldn't communicate at all. It was like speaking with an alien.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, can I have them back…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind, but… forcing me to take them off here… Keiki-kun really is bold," She said as she put her hands on 'her' underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, stop! Time out! You can just return them later! No, tomorrow is fine too! Please wear your own panties!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, such a shame. I thought you were ordering me to do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was not."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that Sayuki had stolen underwear from Keiki's room. But sadly, those were not Cinderella's panties, but rather Keiki's boxers. Apparently, she wasn't Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, why are you wearing them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you've been ignoring me, I wanted to feel Keiki-kun's warmth, which is why I decided to wear them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of novel-like excuse is this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, a boy's underwear feels a bit loose… It's so windy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't play with your skirt like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun. Won't you try wearing my panties as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As always, Keiki didn't understand a single thing Sayuki was saying. But, he couldn't deny the fact that her teasing smile was really cute-</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Keiki was had been adversely affected by her idiotic jokes and pranks, because he didn't mind this at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day, it started raining after lunch. Since the sun was hidden by the grey sky, it felt a little bit chilly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the second day of their three-day-long finals, after classes. Keiki, whose grades were neither good nor bad, had the bad luck of getting cleaning duty on that day, and headed towards the entrance. But his feet suddenly stopped in front of a blackboard, which was filled with posters about summer vacation, summer festivals, part-time jobs, and more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Summer vacation, huh… It's right after exams are over."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the tests were over, he just had to overcome a few days of normal school until he could finally enjoy some quality vacation time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I'd really like to figure out Cinderella's identity before vacation starts…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Getting his first girlfriend ever and being all lovey-dovey with her was his goal. And starting that this very summer vacation would be ideal for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sea, fireworks… There were countless opportunities to enjoy the company of a lovable, cute girl. But if things kept going like this, his days would be as dull and gray as the rainy skies at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This year I want to spend my vacation with a cute girlfriend!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, he could narrow down the Cinderella candidates to only two people. When both of them had confessed their abnormal personalities, they had been wearing pink underwear, hoping that it would raise their chances of success. And on the day when the two of them had gone over to Keiki's house, Cinderella's panties disappeared. Thus, Keiki deduced that one of them must've taken her, basically Cinderella's, panties back. But Keiki couldn't find any proof to confirm that the most obvious candidate, Tokihara Sayuki, was the one who had done this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Tokihara-senpai isn't Cinderella, then that only leaves…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once he stepped out of the school building, he spotted the Kouhai in question. She leaned with her back on the wall, using the roof of the building as a shelter from the rain. There was no way that he could mistake her blonde hair in this world filled with grey.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?" As he raised his voice, the girl raised her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Are you waiting for someone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Yuika happened to forget her umbrella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why you're standing here, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though Yuika watched the weather forecast yesterday, it completely slipped her mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll escort you home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Really? Yuika's home is in the complete opposite direction."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Leaving my troubled Kohai here would leave a bad taste in my mouth anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Going this far just for Yuika… Are you finally ready to become her slave?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring that dissatisfied protest, Keiki took an umbrella out of his bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">Opening up the blue umbrella, he stood next to Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, let's go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… Yes…" She modestly stepped under the umbrella.</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with the calm, cat-like Kouhai, he stepped out of the school gate. Under the soothing sound of the rain hitting the umbrella, he matched his pace with the small-bodied girl and walked a different route from usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much. You really saved Yuika. At this rate, she might've</p>
<p class="null-p">had to go home while being soaked by the rain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really is unfortunate to not have an umbrella on a rainy day like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai looked like a prince on a shining horse."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly do umbrellas and shining horses have in common?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the prince will become captivated by Yuika's charm, and swear eternal loyalty to her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The prince was made into a servant?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The picture book that the girl had created was fantasy in a lot of ways. The story within it, however, was something that kids should never be allowed to hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, they continued walking next to each other while talking about various things. After a bit, Keiki's arm bumped into Yuika's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really is narrow under such a small umbrella."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, this umbrella was created for only one person. Though Keiki didn't consider it such a bad thing to be so close with such a cute girl, he still would've prefered to have a bigger umbrella right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, how about we do this?" With these words, Yuika clung to Keiki's arm. "Now it should be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But now it's pretty hard for me to walk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you unsatisfied? As a boy, shouldn't you be happy that such a cute girl is clinging to you like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it does have its benefits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How honest. If you were to become Yuika's slave, she might even let you experience the feeling of her breasts as she pushes even more onto you."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_8.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"No thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then this service is over. But don't come crying to Yuika later~"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, she separated from Keiki, only to let out a cute 'Hyan' as the cold rain hit her shoulder. With that, she clung to him once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't want to get wet, so she'll give you a bit more service."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, thanks for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like this, the rain continued to fall as the two of them continued to walk closely next to each other until they arrived at Yuika's house. It took them around five minutes altogether.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much for bringing Yuika home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem. Well, I'm gonna go my own way now - Achoo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki let out a sneeze as he went to walked away, probably because of the rain. It was oddly cold for July, and Keiki felt a shiver down his spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is a bit cold day, yes. If you want, you can come in for a bit. Yuika will make you warm tea as a thanks for bringing her home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this rate, you might actually catch a cold, and Yuika doesn't want that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll take you up on that offer."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, he entered the house and was guided to Yuika's room. After she showed him to his seat, he put down his schoolbag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We don't have green tea right now, sadly. Which do you prefer, black tea or coffee?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… I'll take coffee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Please a a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, Yuika left the room. Having been left behind, Keiki found himself unable to calm down in this new environment, and glanced around the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is Yuika-chan's room, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The room was properly tidied up. It had a table and a bed, big bookshelves filled with countless books to prove that Yuika really was a bookworm, and various stuffed toys. And the sweet aroma that he could always smell when he was with her was very prominent here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Not good, not good. For some reason my heart's beating faster…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since this was his first time in a girl's room, except Mizuha's, he found himself getting nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a moment? This situation… isn't this my once-in-a-lifetime chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Last month, Cinderella's panties had disappeared from Keiki's room. And on that day, he had two visitors over: Sayuki and Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he had determined that Sayuki wasn't the thief, there couldn't be any possible culprit other than Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Yuika-chan is Cinderella, she might've hid her panties somewhere in here."</p>
<p class="null-p">He carefully checked outside the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's probably still preparing the drinks, so I should have some time…</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that she wasn't here, and the room wasn't protected, he could do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, he gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no better chance than this…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wasting no time, he hurriedly started looking around the room, which made him feel like one of those spies in movies. But there could only be one place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, it can only be in here, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What entered his field of vision was a small dresser. It was rectangular in shape and reached up to Keiki's stomach. With a pounding heart, he moved closer and opened it up with a shaking hand. Just as he expected, in said chest was Yuika's underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan really has a quite lot of panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">White and blue striped panties among others… they really were cute designs befitting Yuika. As Keiki imagined that Yuika was wearing such a pair right now, he-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, no… I'm getting a bit excited over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Here was a boy who was getting excited from a girl's panties while being inside said girl's room. Though he had to accept that he looked like a pervert, he had to pull through this to figure out Cinderella's identity. With his heart beating even faster than before, he checked every single pair of panties. But he couldn't find Cinderella's panties among them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're not here… Maybe she's actually wearing them now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… right now I'm looking through Yuika-chan's panties to look for… Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">-Did someone just ask me a question?</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, he saw Yuika standing there with an angelic smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Yuika-chan. You were really fast, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have an electric tea kettle, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a plate in her hands, with two cups on top of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Senpai. What exactly does this mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She showed him her phone, and on that screen was a photo of Keiki holding up a pair of Yuika's panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's over… My life is over…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way to talk himself out of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Yuika took a picture as proof. What would happen if Yuika went to the police with it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This smiling angel looked like a demon to Keiki's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Yuika always wanted a docile slave."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki knew immediately what she meant by that. But his answer still hadn't changed from when she confessed. He still didn't want to become a slave, stripped of his pride and worth as a human being.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the current circumstances were different. The picture on the girl's phone felt like a collar around his neck. Now he had no other choice but to obey her-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-senpai. You will become Yuika's slave, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I will become Yuika-chan's slave."</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that, the prince became the hardcore sadist's slave.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: Yuika-Sama Wants To Be The Only One</p>
<p class="null-p">This is a story of something that happened before the love letter incident, in April. In a library room after class, a blonde-haired girl was reading a book.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Koga-san, you're here today as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't have anything to do with Kiryuu-senpai, Yuika believes." Keiki's normal question was met with a weird response.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it was at least better than the beginning, when she never answered him at all. This was how they always spent their time in the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first time that Kiryuu Keiki and Koga Yuika met was when the boy was in his second year of high school. They had a Senpai-Kouhai relationship, but it wasn't like they were exceptionally close. Keiki for his part was still interested in the blonde-haired beauty with pure blue eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her foreign hair and looks, she was on a different playing field than most people, for better or worse. Be it classmates or other library committee members, everyone kept their distance from her, which made it impossible for her to fit in with these groups. The girl for her part showed no interest at all in joining these groups, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yuika from that time was clearly excluded from her surroundings, and that resulted in her seeming ice-cold and distant. Keiki thought this was the main reason that other people avoided her. Her gem-like blue eyes were always fixated on some book in her hands, and she rejected any sort of contact with other people. Even so, Keiki continued to reach out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san, what book are you reading?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without a single word, she showed Keiki the cover of said book. The title was 'The world's most indecisive prince.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… a pretty crazy title. Is it interesting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. It has a bit of an comedic touch, and Yuika thinks that it's pretty interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation had already ended, and Yuika returned her gaze to the book. When she closed her mouth, she really looked like a puppet. The soft breeze from the open window made her hair flutter gently. This picture in front of Keiki looked like it was straight out of a painting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is it that weird?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thinks that it's pretty rude to just stare at someone like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, sorry. You're right. It was just so beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beautiful…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. What beautiful hair- is what I thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai really is a weird person," The girl let out a sigh and looked even more closely at Keiki. "Kiryuu-senpai, why are you so concerned about Yuika? Such an audacious Kohai isn't cute at all, right? …Does Senpai think that making fun of girls is fun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, could you keep quiet? As you can see, I'm in the middle of reading," She said with no hesitation, and returned her gaze to the book once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">But before he could fall into self-loathing, Keiki noticed a book lying on</p>
<p class="null-p">top of the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I've heard that book before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I thought that the scene were the protagonist made himself the enemy of his own country for the heroine was really cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right! This book's protagonist is incredibly cool!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He overcame many troubles, and the end of the story when he saved the heroine from imprisonment was really the greatest!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah. I was really moved by that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right?! Just thinking about it makes Yuika's heart beat faster!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the girl's eyes sparkling and seeing the bright smile on her face, Keiki let out a giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san, you finally laughed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuika heard that, she realized that she'd gotten a little bit too excited, and her cheeks turned slightly pink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't think that you have something you can use against Yuika now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't anything special.</p>
<p class="null-p">The trigger was simply because the two of them had read the same book.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after that, they started talking during their job as library committee members about their favorite books, and gradually started to get on better terms with each other. Slowly but steady, the girl began showing an honest smile. And Keiki thought that his Kouhai's smile was so much more charming than her cold gaze from before.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that day when Keiki was found searching through Yuika's underwear, his slave life had started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai. Yuika wants to drink some cold juice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll buy one immediately!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Running immediately when the girl wishes for a drink…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai. Yuika's shoulders are a bit stiff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As you wish, I will massage your shoulders!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Massaging the girl's shoulders on command…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai. Yuika's socks have gotten a bit hot. Help her change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, gladly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Or helping her change her socks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Senpai. Yuika knows that you have a knee-sock fetish, so no sniffing, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't. And I don't have a knee-sock fetish either."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will stomp on you if you try to look at her panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't look."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he wanted to, he couldn't because her skirt was blocking his view.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she commanded, he took off her knee-socks and put on a new pair that Yuika had taken out of her backpack. He was kneeling down in front of her, which made him look like the butler of an egoistic Ojou-sama. And since they were doing this inside the club room, it was no wonder that the black-haired club president was looking at them with an astonished expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun- rather, Master?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not your master, but what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you obeying Koga-san's orders like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… well, a lot happened, and I became Yuika-chan's slave, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, this is how it is," Yuika hugged Keiki from behind to prove Keiki's statement. "Keiki-senpai became Yuika's slave. Such a shame, isn't it, Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki calmly responded to Yuika's obvious provocation. "Hmph, you're probably just exploiting one of Keiki-kun's weaknesses to make him follow you, right? My Master won't be led astray by those small breasts of yours, Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How sharp…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what you would expect from a genius with top grades. She might be a hopeless case when it comes to sports, but her head totally makes up for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no meaning to that kind of relationship. This master and servant play surely won't continue for much longer, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu…" The pin-point accuracy of Sayuki's deduction robbed the small girl of her words. "I-If that's the case…! Keiki-senpai, swear to Yuika, here and now, that you like small breasts more than big breasts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Why has it come to that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, you like fondling Yuika's breasts and pretending that it was an accident, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-, Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, is that so? In my case, he's already put his hand deep into the valley of my breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them certainly weren't lying. Of course, both events either were an accident, or a higher force had influenced them greatly. Though he would have been lying if he said that he wasn't happy about either one, an accident was still an accident.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this about, Keiki-senpai? Did you really put your hands between her breasts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this about, Keiki-kun? Did you really fondle Koga-san's small breasts? Was it a lie when you said that you liked big breasts? What a cruel betrayal…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them attacked him at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please say it clearly! Small…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or big! Which do you prefer?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">On his right were small breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">On his left were big breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">While his Kouhai's modest chest had its own charm, the melon-like breasts of his Senpai could play with the heart of every single boy in this school. The feeling he got from Yuika's breasts was wonderful, and the marshmallow-like breasts from Sayuki almost held him captive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Big breasts are superb, small breasts are justice. There was no need to discuss which was better. Both of them were peerless flowers in this world. But, if Keiki had to choose one here and now, the answer was obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like big breasts! Even if I become a slave, that answer won't ever change!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot Idiot! Keiki-senpai you idiot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, this time it's my win it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">The loser softly hit her servant on the chest, while the winner showed a smile. But the judge still had something he wanted to add.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But don't get me wrong, it's not like I hate small breasts or anything. Be it small or big, I like them all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Saying it like it's a famous proverb doesn't make it any better!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, the howling of a loser isn't very nice to look at."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gunununu…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Sayuki's provocation, the blonde beauty grit her teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that it's come to this, Yuika will have to show you our bonds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Koga-san, what do you mean-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika turned to face Keiki and stretched out her small hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, paw!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing these words, Keiki unconsciously put his hand on top of hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, crap… that was by reflex."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the day that Yuika had taken that ominous photo of Keiki searching through her panty drawer, Yuika had drilled various commands into his body. Because of that, his body reacted on his own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun… To think that your training has progressed this much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tears started building up in Sayuki's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I don't want to see my master being servile to another bitch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait, Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Sayuki took quite a lot of damage from that, because she dashed out of the room like a maiden in love whose confession had just been rejected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehehe. It seems like she understood who Keiki-senpai really belongs to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no no…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The master showed a self-confident smile while the servant could only look at the door with an exasperated expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh, all this dealing with Witch-senpai made Yuika tired. She'd really like a massage now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, my lady."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can push a little harder."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ahhh, that's good."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like this, Yuika continued to show her hidden personality: A hardcore sadist with a cute face. But of course, Keiki didn't plan on staying her slave</p>
<p class="null-p">forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Hold back for now, Kiryuu Keiki. You have to bear with it for now. There will come a day when you find find out if Yuika-chan really is your Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Yuika was Cinderella, it would mean that she was deeply in love with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that was the case, I could maybe make use this master-slave contract, and use her feelings to my own ends. Making her do this and that might be a possibility! For example, I could make her wear risky maid clothes and serve me!</p>
<p class="null-p">Making Yuika wear a maid uniform and serve Keiki… There should be no greater humiliation for that hardcore sadist.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could force her to go on all fours and pat her cute butt… That might be nice, yeah.</p>
<p class="null-p">He envisioned it: Yuika with a bright red face, trying her best to withstand the embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">The perfect revenge. A perfect plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">To improve his current situation, he had to find tangible proof that Yuika was the Cinderella who dropped her panties. To achieve that, he had to find said panties. That was his reason for playing the role of an obedient slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hehehe, just you wait. You'll suffer just like I do," Whispered the servant who had planned great humiliation for his master, while continuing to give her a massage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… should I just put it in here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, a bit lower. Slowly, okay? It's a bit narrow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn… Huh? It really is narrow, I can't quite fit it in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, don't be so rough. You're gonna tear it apart."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I know……… Ah, it went in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It did… go in. That really got my heart racing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having finished pushing the boxes into the metal shelf, Keiki stepped down from the ladder and checked his surroundings for any leftover boxes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It seems like that was the last of them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, thanks. You really saved me," said the girl with one eye hidden by her bangs, Fujimoto Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a fellow student in the same year, and the student council vice-president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for suddenly calling you over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's no big deal."</p>
<p class="null-p">Friday, after classes, Keiki had received a mail from Ayano, saying 'Emergency spotted. Requesting back-up,' calling him to the student council office to help her sort out some boxes. Inside said boxes were bundles of papers and student council documents. Since they were pretty heavy, Ayano had no other choice but to ask Keiki for help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really saved me. We only have girls in the student council, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, right, the president is also a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So is our secretary. That's why the student council is trying their hardest to recruit boys. Kiryuu-kun, how about you join us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm… I sadly have to decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because you're satisfied with your calligraphy club harem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The calligraphy club isn't as much of a utopia as you might think it is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, every single member except Keiki was a pervert through and through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a shame. Just when I thought that I could get a chance to sniff Kiryuu-kun's scent every day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that's what it was."</p>
<p class="null-p">This honor student named Ayano was actually an olfactophile, and she especially took a liking to Keiki's smell, which is why she once drugged him by putting sleeping pills inside his tea in order to take off his boxers one day after gym class.</p>
<p class="null-p">And said dangerous individual continued smiling with a cute face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be a bit sudden, but how much do you want for your worn underwear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not a product you can buy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For your underwear, I'm willing to pay even 30.000yen. If you had gym class on that day, I'd make it 50.000."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't sell them, okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Ayano really wanted to get Keiki's panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are countless girls who would sell their worn panties to old guys, so it shouldn't be too weird for a boy to sell his underwear to a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hate the idea of selling my underwear to a girl in the same year as me."</p>
<p class="null-p">An old man who wants the panties of a high school girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">A high school girl who wants some quick cash.</p>
<p class="null-p">Supply and demand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, please give up on my underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a shame. Then let me at least get a good sniff of Kiryuu-kun today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't just cling to me like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, this smell, I really like it. I might become addicted to this. Sniff sniff Haah… Haah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person's done for… I have to get away quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ayano looked like a cat as she clung to Keiki with a red face. Even though getting hugged by such a cute girl should've been a happy occurrence for Keiki, he couldn't accept it as such.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he tried his best to escape the grip of this pervert, he heard some light footsteps behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he turned around, she was there. Standing inside the door frame was the blonde-haired western-looking Queen. Having spotted the two of them clinging to each other, Yuika stiffened up and just smiled at them like an angel, but that gave her an even scarier atmosphere than usual.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_9.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?! W-Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Yuika's question, Ayano's cheeks turned slightly pink as she strengthened her grip on Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun is the person who satisfies my sexual needs the most."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's expression darkened after hearing these bomb-like words from the vice president.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-, Fujimoto-san?! What might you be saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the truth. Ayano-san is the prisoner of Kiryuu-kun. I get aroused just from hugging him like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her bomb-like statements aren't stopping?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she was actually a prisoner of Keiki's 'smell', there was no time for him to clear up that misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without speaking a single word, Yuika just tightly grabbed Keiki's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Come with Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">These words were filled with an immense amount of pressure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Understood…" His voice shook.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was pulled along by Yuika's hand and the two of them left the room behind them. They walked down the hallway, and Yuika led him into an empty classroom. After locking both the door and the windows, Yuika turned around to face Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, it's finally just the two of us."</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, Yuika always acted like a domestic cat in front of people other than Keiki and Sayuki, but it looked like she was barely able to hold back just earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Keiki-senpai. Do you have any final words?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm innocent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Every guilty person says that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this a witch trial?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been declared guilty from the very start.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Senpai? Yuika is mad, you know? She didn't expect you to go cheat on her like that. It seems like there's a dire need for punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm probably going to regret asking this… but what are you going to do to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, please turn around."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, you're going to slap me on my butt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, that might not be a bad idea at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">With stiff movements, Keiki turned around. He had no idea what she would do, and because of the building heat in the room, Keiki started sweating. The moment one drop of sweat hit the floor- he got hugged from behind. At his back, there was the soft feeling of a female body, and he could feel her breath as well. Because of this sudden development, Keiki's heart started beating like crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan? W-What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's punishment. Getting hugged like this on such a humid day isn't very comforting, is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even more than that, he was embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika didn't have the same fetish as Ayano, so there should be no reason for her to hug him like this. That would mean that there was no other meaning behind this hug other than 'punishment'. Thinking that, Keiki's heart almost jumped out of his chest. Maybe this actually is her intended punishment?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's about before. I was just helping Fujimoto-san rearrange some boxes in the student council office. Those boxes are quite heavy, which is why she asked me for help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmph."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't believe me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just this once, Yuika will believe you… She will, but don't get so close to other girls like that," She sounded like she was pouting as she put more strength into her arms. "Right now, Keiki-senpai is Yuika's slave, after all." Though she only softly whispered those words, they arrived at a certain boy's ear loud and clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he understood her true intentions, it was still enough to obstruct the boy's logical thinking-</p>
<p class="null-p">He decided to keep secret the fact that he got excited because of his cute master.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slaves don't have any free days. Even on Sundays, they can't get away if their master calls. That being said, after Keiki was woken up by a love call from his cute Kohai, he immediately made his way towards the Koga household. Though it was only morning, the sun was shining pretty intensely.</p>
<p class="null-p">With sweat on his cheeks, Keiki arrived at his destination barely in time. Shortly after he rang the bell, the blonde-haired beauty showed her face. The girl who greeted him was wearing a white one-piece. Since it was a shoulder-free type, her refined, bright shoulders were in plain sight. With that white one-piece, she looked like a real angel, and was without a doubt incredibly cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good Morning, Keiki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You arrived just on time. It looks like you're slowly starting to awaken to your slave nature, fufufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said that you would send that picture to Mizuha, after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. It would've been a lot of trouble for you if Mizuha-senpai saw that picture."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As always, you're as sadistic as it gets…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just imagining Mizuha seeing that picture sent shivers down his spine. Since she was a clean freak, she would surely scorn him. Keiki was confident that he would die from shock if Mizuha said "Nii-san, you're the worst" with that lovable voice of hers. This siscon's heart wasn't strong enough to live on if his sister hated him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well for now, please come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Koga household was as quiet as before. It seemed like both her parents were working all day until late at night. Or maybe they weren't going to return that day at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder if she's lonely being here alone all the time…</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the Kiryuu household's parents were gone just as, or even more, often, Keiki at least had his sister at home, who help counter the loneliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">With these thoughts, Keiki followed Yuika to her room again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, Yuika will have Keiki-senpai work as slave again today, but before that, please change into this."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Yuika took out was a black piece of western clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this… a suit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Completely wrong. These are butler clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Butler clothes…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he had only seen them in manga or dramas before, once he took a closer look at them, he could tell they were indeed different from a suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is handmade, you know? Yuika was the one who made it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously? This is insanely good quality, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is good at sewing and such. Actually, she stayed up all night to finish this, so she's a bit sleepy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you go so far…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those clothes are a present for Keiki-senpai, so please hurry up and change into them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has to check if it fits you, so please don't mind her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got it. Then I'll strip here- wait, isn't this weird?! Get out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaaaaay."</p>
<p class="null-p">After waiting to let Yuika leave the room, Keiki took off his clothes and changed into the clothes she prepared for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Somehow, the size is perfect. Even though she didn't take any measurements…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder if she made it just by guessing.</p>
<p class="null-p">After being surprised by his Kouhai's unexpected talent, he called Yuika back. Seeing the poof of Keiki's job change from student to butler, Yuika's face brightened up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, it does fit you quite well. It really gives you a butler-like feeling."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for not saying something weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Try calling Yuika 'Ojou-sama'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood, Ojou-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew, that really has a lot of impact. It makes Yuika want to tie you up and make you cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't… Or rather, why butler clothes anyway?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, do you hate maids?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really love them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the same reason. Girls adore butlers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was a bit confused, but it somehow made some degree of sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, since the preparations have been finished, we can go out now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go out… where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To a bookstore. Since our tests are over, there are countless books that Yuika wants to read. But it might be a bit too difficult for her to carry them by herself, so she would like some help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, books can be pretty heavy, can't they?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, let's go immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Wait a moment. We're going… in these clothes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course? After all, Senpai is Yuika's butler today. Please satisfy Yuika and give her all of your attention today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of humiliating idea is this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika's looking forward to the bookstore~" The butler's master completely ignored that remark and turned around on her heels.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Yuika actually looked like an Ojou-sama with that white one-piece, Keiki could only stare after her in awe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, don't space out over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As his Ojou-sama pulled him by the hand, the freshly-made butler left the Koga household behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as he'd expected, the butler clothes gathered a lot of attention from customers and employees alike. After Yuika decided on the books she wanted, they took a quick break in a nearby park on their way home.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their goal wasn't to play on the playground equipment, but rather to rest in a quiet place. Because the park had a pavilion that was surrounded by trees and covered by a roof, it was really soothing. When they arrived, Keiki dropped the bookbags and took a seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so heavy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, you're supposed to be a boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heavy stuff is still heavy for boys, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was close to a 20-minute walk from the Koga household to the bookstore, and the plastic bags were filled with about 10 hardcover books, so it wasn't any wonder that Keiki's arms had started to hurt from carrying them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even if you complain, you're still happy to be able to work for Yuika, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not that much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm, you say that now. But sooner or later, Yuika's education will start showing its effects and you will gladly do anything for her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please keep it easy on me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it is a fact that you're working hard for Yuika. As your master, she has to give you a fitting reward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah reward… no, please no more panties!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's gaze naturally wandered to Yuika's lower body as she sat next to him. After all, she had a habit of presenting him her panties. But, contrary to his expectations, her cheeks turned a soft pink and she tightly gripped the bottom part of her dress and looked up at Keiki with a sulking expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, to think that you want panties on this hot day. Senpai really is a hopeless pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a pervert, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You lost your right to say that sentence the moment you started rummaging through my panty drawer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Giving you Yuika's sweaty panties is a bit too embarrassing, so please put up with it for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The time when I became a panty-loving pervert inside my kouhai's</p>
<p class="null-p">head…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even now, Keiki still hadn't found any definite clues that pointed to Yuika being Cinderella, but he couldn't give up yet. This was currently his only hope for freeing himself from being her slave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tada! This will be the reward this time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What Yuika took out of a plastic bag was a cup of vanilla ice cream. Before they stopped in the park, she had bought that at a convenience store. Taking out a wooden spoon, she scooped out one portion and held it towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just this once, Yuika will feed you. It's a reward for working so hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay. Then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he was a bit confused by the sudden development, he was unable to say no to that soothing-looking ice cream and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it was sweet, cool, and very delicious, Keiki couldn't fully enjoy it since the 'Open wide~' from Yuika completely stole his attention and made his heart beat faster. Not to mention that Yuika had an embarrassed, blushing smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now Yuika wants to eat some as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah. Yuika-chan can just eat what's left."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then will Senpai feed me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay~ Ah, but, we only have one spoon. And this would turn be an indirect kiss…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Yuika doesn't mind, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's Keiki-senpai, then Yuika doesn't mind an indirect kiss…" The girl nervously fidgeted as she said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that lovable sight as she looked up at him, Keiki gulped once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He took the spoon in his hand and scooped out a spoonful of ice cream, bringing it towards the girls mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…H-How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm… Ehehehe, it was so embarrassing that Yuika didn't pay attention to the taste."</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That bashful smile of hers made his heart skip a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">T-That was a really unfair surprise…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-senpai? Give Yuika some more, please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, yeah. Leave it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to cover up his embarrassment, Keiki scooped out another spoonful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Feeding each other ice cream like this makes it seem like we're lovers, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lovers?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing his Kouhai's words, the virgin's hand shook. As a result of that, the ice cream on the spoon, which should have gone into the girl's mouth, dropped onto her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hya?! Cold!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, s-sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, really, what are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. I'll wipe it away immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, please wait a moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's words stopped Keiki as he was about to take out a tissue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take responsibility, and lick it away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? ……Eh?! L-Lick it…? Me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there anybody else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki looked around in confusion, checking if any other people could see them right now. In the meantime, the little devil continued speaking with an angel-like smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't hurry up, it will melt, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting himself get teased any more would him a failure of a Senpai. Making up his mind, he brought his body closer to the girl next to him. Her eyes, somewhat expectant, somewhat afraid, looked straight at him. And- he brought his tongue to her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyan?! Nnn……" Yuika let out a shriek once, only to forcefully push her</p>
<p class="null-p">lips together. "Nnn… Ah, fufu, it tickles…"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_10.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Every time his tongue moved over her pure-white skin, she let out a moan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ahahaha. Senpai, so cute. You're licking like your life depends on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">You look like a god."</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't have the leisure to respond to that. The girl's skin was so unbelievably smooth and soft. Not to mention he could taste the sweet flavour of the ice cream and smell the impactful aroma of the girl. He could feel his head starting to spin.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was clearly different from a normal Senpai-Kouhai relationship. Even if the boy was her slave, would a girl really allow something like this to happen if she didn't have any feelings for him? Normally, that would be unthinkable.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, is that affection of hers love? Was Yuika really his Cinderella?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki finished his duty and separated from her. Even after that, he hadn't found his answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's over already? Shame," Yuika said, displeased, but judging from her red cheeks, she was indeed embarrassed about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, like that, she started patting him on the head like he was her beloved pet dog.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well done. Good boy, good boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"First I'm a butler, now I'm a dog…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But as long as his mistress was laughing, the servant thought that it wasn't too bad. At first, he had really hated it, but recently, his resistance towards acting as a servant had started to disappear slowly, and he found pleasure in giving his everything to Yuika-</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, I really shouldn't be getting happy about that, though!</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like how he had acted sadistic during his date with Sayuki, Keiki felt</p>
<p class="null-p">like he was awakening to being a masochist.</p>
<p class="null-p">No no, this is just for one week! As soon as that photo is gone, I'll stop being her slave immediately!</p>
<p class="null-p">Reassuring himself that he wasn't actually getting used to being a butler, he once more reminded himself of his goal. Namely, he wanted to find out if Yuika was really the person who sent him the love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai? Did something happen? You're making such a difficult face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you getting agitated about now? Senpai is so weird," Even as she stared at him in bemusement, she looked cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart might be filled with malicious intent, her looks were that of an angel. Her fluffy blonde hair was extraordinarily beautiful, her blue eyes looked like gemstones, and her small stature made you want to hug her every time you saw her because she was so cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether if he was a slave or not, if a boy had the opportunity to stay close to her 24/7, there might not be any greater happiness in the world. Though she says a lot of unkind words, the sweet reward, namely being pat on the head like this, might actually be worth it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being a girl's slave… Might not be so bad after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, the lamb was once more lost in its thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they returned to the Koga household, and Keiki finished his duty of bringing the spoils of war into Yuika's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, good work today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing much if it's for my lady."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Then please rest a bit, Keiki-senpai. Yuika will take a shower in the</p>
<p class="null-p">meantime."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, have fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika knows that you probably are interested in a girl's naked body, but please refrain from peeking, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but if you really have to peek, then Yuika doesn't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which is it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But a wonderful punishment will be waiting for you in that case."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll stay here obediently~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had enough of punishment. Getting freshly-worn panties stuffed into his mouth, being pushed down and violated… He had enough memories already. Seemingly satisfied with her slave's answer, the girl nodded and left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so… Taking a shower while there's a boy in her room… Isn't she a bit too carefree?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be because she trusted him this much, but it could also be because she doesn't even see him as a boy. Just thinking about the possibility of it being the latter made him feel sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fu fu fu, you can let down your guard as much as you want. Once you've started taking a shower, I'll take the opportunity to search through your panties again!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Also, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mistress?! W-W-W-What would be your business?!" The butler's shoulders twitched as his name suddenly got called out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika forgot to say it, but if you search through Yuika's panties again,</p>
<p class="null-p">you'll get a life-long punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Life-long punishment?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, please behave like a good boy, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl started humming as they boy saw her off. He gave up on his plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…But still, at this rate, I'll never find out who Cinderella is."</p>
<p class="null-p">He still did not know the whereabouts of the panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was wondering if there weren't a good way to quickly find that out…</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!" Yuika's scream rang out from inside the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that his Kouhai was in danger, Keiki dashed out of the room. He rushed down the stairs and hurriedly stormed into the bathroom. There he spotted Yuika, whose body was shaking like crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai! Spider! There's a spider!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh… A spider?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at where Yuika was pointing, there was a small, eight-legged living being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really. It's just a spider…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not just a spider! This is horrible! P-Please do something!" Her eyes started tearing up, seemingly unable to handle that small living being in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">A queen who was afraid of spiders. Keiki had found out a new weakness of the little devil.</p>
<p class="null-p">He picked up a hand-sized broom inside the bathroom, lured the spider onto it, and carried it to safety out of the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. It's okay now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Thank you very much…" With the imminent danger gone, Yuika let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki then finally understood the current situation. Inside the bathroom was Yuika, who was in the middle of taking a shower. Of course, she was wearing appropriate clothing. Namely, nothing at all. Because of that, Keiki could see everything. Her small, yet soft-looking breasts, her lower region, everything. And in the next second, Yuika realized that Keiki was just staring at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai? --Fueh?!" She hurriedly hid her body with her arms and her face went as red as a tomato.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… Ah…" Her pink lips were softly shaking as tears started forming in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, her hand reached for a bottle of soap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How long are you planning to stare!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guha?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The soap bottle landed a clean hit on his face. And sadly, it was still filled to the bream, which brought intense pain to his facial region.</p>
<p class="null-p">After barely covering her body with a bath towel, the girl gave her slave the two-command combo of 'Sit' and 'Wait' in her room, and went back to finish her shower. After doing that and changing into clothes with more defensive power, she returned to the room. Now she wasn't wearing the</p>
<p class="null-p">white one-piece anymore, but rather a black dress with black knee-socks. It seemed like she had changed from being an angel to being a devil. She was sitting on top of her bed with crossed legs, looking down on the criminal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there anything left you want to say? Nothing? Then, the judgment- Death penalty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The judge brought down her cruel judgment immediately, intending to end the boy's life once and for all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The crime for seeing Yuika's naked body is heavy. Now, the punishment. Lower your head! And reflect on your mistake!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"L-Like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he lowered his head, sitting in dogeza, he heard a faint laugh from above.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More. Beg for forgiveness. Say 'Please massage this bad dog's head with Yuika-sama's foot!'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please massage this bad dog's head with Yuika-sama's foot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. I can't help it then. Just this once, Yuika will do as Senpai asks."</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, punishment time began.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's feet softly went up and down on the slave's head. Apparently, a human's leg had three times the strength of an arm. Even though it was done by a girl, the pain couldn't be understated. Not counting the socks, he was being directly stepped on by a girl younger than him. Though it was quite the humiliation, Keiki didn't resist at all. Maybe because of his guilty conscience from seeing the girl naked? Or maybe because he actually started feeling comfortable being treated like this by that beauty? If it was the latter, Keiki might've already been done for at this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Senpai? Do you have no words of apology?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeaaaah…! I-I'm very sorryyyyyyyy!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you know why you've incurred Yuika's wrath?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I stared at you in your birthday suit while my eyes licked every inch of your body!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. How pitiable, Senpai. That face of yours is the best! Yuika can't help but get excited!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki once more painfully realized that the girl above him was a hopeless hardcore sadist. But the most he could do about it was let out a muffled squeak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Really, Senpai is a hopeless mongrel," With a quiet voice, Yuika separated her foot from his head. "But, Yuika is also happy that you immediately came rushing to her aid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but she won't forget about the sin you committed! It's a serious crime! Don't think that she'll forgive you just like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, okay…" A bit taken aback, he could only nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Yuika took a deep breath and patted the bed beside her. She probably wanted him to sit next to her. As he did so, she leaned against him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is also punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please pet Yuika's head."</p>
<p class="null-p">While he did as he was told, the girl slowly closed her eyes, seemingly enjoying the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow, this is really nostalgic. When Yuika was younger, she often had this done to her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Past Yuika's gaze was a photo, standing on top of her desk. Shown on said photo was a small girl with blonde hair and an older woman. There was no mistake that the small girl was Yuika, though her hair was a bit longer now. That means that the woman next to her was-</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person, is it possibly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It's Yuika's grandmother."</p>
<p class="null-p">The grandmother from England. As far Keiki could tell, Yuika probably had inherited her hair and eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As you can see, Yuika has always looked like this. She hated being teased about it, which is why she was always alone. And to fill that void, she was always at her grandmother's home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging from her voice, these memories were painful rather than nostalgic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika's grandmother was a kind person. She would listen to Yuika's stories, and cheer her up when after she was teased again. She often… pat her on the head. Yuika really loved her grandmother. As long as she had her, she didn't need anything else. That's why she felt betrayed once she lost her grandmother. 'Even though she loves Yuika, she left her alone', something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It must've felt like a loved person suddenly had started ignoring her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After Yuika's grandmother passed away, she distanced herself even more from her surroundings. Yuika built a wall, got close to nobody, and in the end, forgot how to love other people. 'Like this, she won't get hurt anymore,' she thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why Yuika-chan was like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alone in the library, only reading books. No doubt she had passed all the years after she lost her grandmother the exact same way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Thinking back on it, Yuika really was a kid."</p>
<p class="null-p">She let out a self-deprecating laugh, and continued with her monologue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If only Yuika would've taken one step forwards, she might've found some friends. There were people who tried talking to her, after all. The reason she was left alone wasn't because of her looks, it was because of herself. She chose to be alone herself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a short break from her monologue, Yuika smiled at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, even though Yuika isn't cute at all, Keiki-senpai still talked to her. Countless times. So much that Yuika thought of you as troublesome."</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, she started to cheer up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first, she thought that Senpai was a rascal who found pleasure in being insulted by her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a hideous misunderstanding…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person, maybe he wants to become Yuika's slave? - is what she thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, what a terrible misunderstanding…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, even so, Senpai was also so kind towards Yuika," She now had a soft smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Yuika really wanted to be left alone, then there was no need for her to stay in the library. Even though she told you to leave her alone every day, you still came in, talked about something weird… And at some point, Yuika started waiting for Senpai to start talking to her. 'Maybe he'll start talking to me today as well,' something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">If she really wanted to be left alone, she could've read her books at home. But still, she continued to come to the library every day after class, hoping that this boring upperclassmen would start talking to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was happy. Happy that you still talked to his cheeky, not-cute-at-all Yuika. Happy that you were so kind to her. This was the first time Yuika actually became interested in somebody else. And because of that, Keiki-senpai - became 'special' to Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">The time they spent together wasn't all that long. Just about a few months since April. But these days were very special for Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Somehow, this has gotten really embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, the situation they were in was rather special: They were alone in the girl's room, leaning against each other. Anyone would be embarrassed in their position. Not to mention that Yuika had spilled out all her feelings towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika's gotten a bit hot. She'll go get something cold to drink."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not being able to stand this atmosphere, Yuika stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? Wah- Woah?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Purely coincidentally, Yuika collapsed back onto the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha. Yuika had gotten a bit dizzy. Maybe because she's missing some sleep?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai? What's wrong? Such a scary face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without answering the girl's question, Keiki turned her waist and put both of his hands on the bed sheets, next to his Kouhai's small body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…? Sen… pai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't move."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fueee?!" The girl started to panic because of the sudden development.</p>
<p class="null-p">For his part, Keiki brought his body closer to her with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… no… Something like this so suddenly…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever future she was imagining in her head, her cheeks started to turn a deep red and she closed her eyes. Even though she had just taken a shower, sweat started building up on her pure white skin again. Every time the bed creaked, her shoulders twitched.</p>
<p class="null-p">And - Keiki pulled out something that was hidden underneath her pillow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yuika-chan, what exactly is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Under her pillow was something that should definitely not be there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something that a girl would never use - a boy's underwear. And, of course,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki definitely recognized them, since they were his.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Why are my boxers inside Yuika's room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… uhm… Tee hee~☆"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Trying to hide it with a smile won't help. I won't stop questioning until I get my answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, her smile froze up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhmm… It's going to be a pretty long story…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keep it short, if you would."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be a bit difficult."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keep it short."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yuika lifted herself up to sit properly on the bed, she starting talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It happened when Yuika was inside Keiki-senpai's room. She wanted to look for porn magazines and such…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing, really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is there some sort of unspoken rule that girls have to look for porn magazines as soon as they enter a boy's room?</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Yuika happened to spot them by pure coincidence. She had never seen a boy's underwear before, and she needed to see how they looked for a reference if she wanted to draw something in her picture books, after all… Before she knew it, she had already put them in her bag…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would count as theft, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the second time a perverted goal had robbed him of a pair of underwear in such a short amount of time. Sayuki aside, to think that even Yuika would do something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, you didn't sniff them, did you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-A little bit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Police, it's this girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika couldn't help it, could she?" The blonde-haired beauty screamed out with a bright red face and tears in her eyes. "Girls, you know, are also curious about a boy's underwear!"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_11.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not counting Ayano's smell fetish, the same had happened with Sayuki as well. Just like boys are interested in a girl's panties, the same could be said for girls about a boy's underwear. Though that didn't give them any right to just steal them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, just realize it already, me… that there are two pairs of underwear gone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, he took back his underwear from Yuika, and she was forced to delete the blackmail photo, which finally freed Keiki from being her slave.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: This Love Is Being Manga-Fied</p>
<p class="null-p">It was after school after the closing ceremony had ended. The last school afternoon for that semester. Trying to escape the late July sun, Keiki and Shouma were sitting on a bench in the shadow of a tree and talking about whatever came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's finally summer vacation tomorrow~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Another year, another summer vacation without a girlfriend~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Shouma has Koharu-senpai, and she's like a girlfriend. You traitor~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're not officially dating yet, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Being more than friends and less than lovers is the same as going out in my book. You're gonna be all lovey-dovey with her during this vacation, right? You're gonna go to the sea and gaze at her swimsuit figure, or make out behind the shrine a fireworks festival… What is this? I'm so envious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today has been really high-stress for you, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Heat and envy can make a person go crazy. For Keiki, who had once again failed to get a girlfriend, just seeing Shouma having a girlfriend (in name) like this made his envy burn fiercer than the mid-summer sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that Koharu-chan's cute, you know. She's small, compact, and her body is easy to hold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't all of those the same thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But there are also enough problems to completely negate all that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, just a while ago, Koharu-chan invited me to her room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, were the walls full of pictures of you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it was a completely normal room at first glance. But there were a lot of DVD's inside her shelves. And they were labeled 'Shouma-kun documentary.' And there were over a hundred volumes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, she had diary entries for almost every daily activity that I do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The stalker girl was as active as always. Her body was small, but her feelings for Shouma were big enough to make up for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if we're talking about that, then what about Sayuki-senpai wearing my underwear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It seems like both of us have it hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the types of perversion were different, the problems they posed for the boys were similarly difficult to deal with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it, even though I wanted to spend this year's summer vacation with a cute girlfriend…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, you still couldn't figure out the identity of your Cinderella, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki received a love letter from an unknown sender back in May. For the</p>
<p class="null-p">following two months, he tirelessly searched for the Cinderella who dropped her panties, to no avail. Just recently, Cinderella's panties had disappeared. Since both Sayuki and Yuika were guests at the Kiryuu household on that day, he deduced that they had the highest possibility of being the thief. If he were to find Cinderella's panties in their possession, that would be the definite proof.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to go now. I've got club," Shouma said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, keep at it."</p>
<p class="null-p">After sending off his friend who left for tennis practice, Keiki once more leaned back against the bench.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaah, I guess that there really wouldn't be a girl who'd actually confess to me," he muttered, reminiscing about past events.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, there had never been a girl who had confessed her love for him (Not counting the confessions from the perverted girls; those didn't make him happy at all). To Keiki, that love letter in the club room had felt like a gift from the heavens above.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah, there he is. Kiryuu," A girl with reddish-brown hair and a sidetail walked towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Nanjou? What's wrong? Did you come here to gather some more material?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without answering, Mao just stopped in front of the bench Keiki was sitting on and pointed her finger towards him. The color of her cheeks then turned a faint pink, and she looked like she had made up her mind about something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu! Become my boyfriend!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, Keiki was unable to grasp what Mao's words meant. The 'my'</p>
<p class="null-p">naturally referred to Mao, and boyfriend referred to… lover. Basically, Mao had just asked Keiki to become her lover-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh?! Did I finally become popular?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiryuu Keiki, in the summer of his second year in high school. On the last day before summer vacation, he had received the first love confession of his life.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day - the first day of summer vacation - the weather was perfect for a stroll. Walking down the asphalt under a bright blue sky, towards the train station, Keiki once more thought about that day's plans.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…To think the day would come where I would go on a date with Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">To Keiki, Mao was a classmate, a friend, and a member of the same club. Though she was in fact a BL mangaka who used Keiki and Shouma as models for her manga, she was also a very kind girl. And for some reason or another, he was going on a date with her on this very day.</p>
<p class="null-p">While mulling over these thoughts, Keiki arrived in front of the train station. Waiting there was a girl he didn't know resting her back against the wall. She seemed to be around the same age as Keiki. She was wearing a tunic with a skirt, and her clothes really gave off a summer-like feeling. In addition, she had her hair hidden by a stylish hat. Her looks basically screamed out "I'm going on a date!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She's crazy beautiful…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was sure that the lucky guy who would be going on a date with her must be a Shouma-level ikemen. And as he was thinking that, he checked around, seeing if he could spot Mao, but to no avail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like Nanjou isn't here yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, there's still some time before we're supposed to meet up…</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, Keiki decided to do the same as the girl and rest his back on the wall, while waiting for Mao. As he did-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Hey, why're you looking away?" While saying that, someone poked Keiki's cheek with their finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he turned around to look at the person in question, the beauty from before was looking straight up him and pouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning. It's pretty hot today, isn't it?" She gave a friendly greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… Have we met somewhere before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that supposed to be a new greeting that's in recently? Or is this just a new trend of yours, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Kiryuu…? Wait, Nanjou?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's me. Aren't you a bit too shocked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but, your atmosphere is so different from usual…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person he thought was just another stranger turned out to be the acquaintance he was waiting for. Mao had her reddish-brown hair straight down, making her look like a completely different person. That grown-up look of hers made Keiki's heart skip a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really put a lot of effort into this, so what do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-It's really cute… I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe. Well, that should be obvious. I totally made you flustered, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm not flustered at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your bright-red face doesn't have a lot of persuasiveness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made Kiryuu's heart beat faster with my different atmosphere… Shouto's image change after cutting his hair made Keeki's heart flutter… Ahh, this might be useful for my next doujinshi. Fufu… Fufufufufufufufufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's Nanjou. This girl's clearly Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">At first glance her appearance might've changed, but deep down she was still the same pervert as before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'm looking forward to today, Mr. Boyfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, well, it'll work out in the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pull yourself together, okay? Today is my important research after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I feel like you're just abusing the situation, I'll give Mizuha a copy of my doujinshi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you please stop using that BL manga to threaten me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way that Keiki could show his beloved little sister a BL manga where he had been used as a model. Hence, he had no other choice but to accept Mao's request.</p>
<p class="null-p">I never expected that things would turn out like this…</p>
<p class="null-p">As he walked next to the well-dressed Mao, Keiki reminisced about the events the day prior. When that girl had approached him in the courtyard, and blatantly stated "Become my boyfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-You were scouted by an editor?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Just recently, there was a doujinshi event, see, and an editor from a monthly magazine spoke up to me. They wanted me to draw a one-shot for a magazine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, that's amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">After she suddenly confessed out of the blue, Mao sat down on the bench and explained her circumstances. Apparently, an editor from a magazine spotted her work at an event, and became really interested. Setting aside the content, her drawing style was the real deal, so it wouldn't be that weird for something like this to happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, wait a moment? You're not telling me that the 'Shouto-Keeki' series is going to be serialized in a magazine, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though the magazine is filled with wonderful romantic developments, that's not the case. It's just a normal monthly shoujo magazine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank God, that's really reassuring."</p>
<p class="null-p">The "Shouto-Keeki" series Keiki was talking about was a series of doujinshi drawn by Mao, and it was an R-18 BL manga with protagonists based off of Keiki and Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But have you ever drawn a shoujo manga before, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never have, but I thought that this might be a good chance to broaden my horizon. I don't know what I will do in the future, but I'm sure that wasting this chance would be a bad choice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry… I was just thinking that you're really giving this a lot of thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? That sounds really rude for some reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that Nanjou's head was only filled with BL manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't really deny that. I mostly think about BL, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Figures."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's enthusiasm for BL was really something to be feared. And the quality of her work was something that even a complete amateur like Keiki understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But in the end, I don't know what it takes to make a shoujo manga, and I just can't get any material at all. So that's why I asked you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing about me becoming your boyfriend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I want you to become my temporary boyfriend and help me out with my research. Since I've only drawn BL manga until now, there'd be no way I'd know what having a boyfriend feels like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wouldn't Shouma be more suitable for a temporary boyfriend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lolicon wouldn't be a good example."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A solid reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you keep saying 'research,' but what exactly do you have in mind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to go on a date with me tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow? That's a bit sudden."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please. Kiryuu is the only one I can ask for this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if you put it like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it was a tremendous request, it was a hundred times better than 'making more material' for her BL manga. And since the prince had failed to find his Cinderella before summer, he didn't really have any plans. All that considered, he didn't have any reason to decline his friend's request.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under these circumstances, the first day of summer vacation arrived, and</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had decided to go on the date with Mao as her temporary boyfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that Nanjou should apologize to me for playing with my pure heart like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Did you really think I was confessing to you? There's no way, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, okay. I'm not popular. I get that." "…………………That's not the case I think." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing- Look, the train's coming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Mao's leadership, the two of them entered the train station.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you're really amazing. To think that an editor would give you such an offer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's still not decided, you know. I'll try drawing it and see how it works out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, today's research is essential."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. So, Kiryuu, make sure that you properly treat me like your lover, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lover, huh… Then should we hold hands?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?" As a shocked voice leaked out of Mao's mouth, her feet stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">And her face went as red as ripe apple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou is unexpectedly pure, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha- I-Idiot! Kiryuu, you idiot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she writes R-18 BL manga, she's embarrassed about holding a boy's hand. Keiki still couldn't understand a fujoshi's way of thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't stay such weird stuff. Let's go already. We'll miss the train," Mao tried to hide her embarrassment as she once more stalked walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without turning around, she wordlessly took Keiki's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So we're still holding hands in the end, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is just for my research. Just today, I have no other choice but to act like lovers with you, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, okay, I'll go out with you just for today~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with that response? That kinda pisses me off."</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite muttering under her breath, she still didn't let go of Keiki's hand. Like this, the fake, one-day couple headed towards the train track while holding hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first place they headed towards was the game center. Unlike their local game center, this one was completely massive. It was the first time that the two of them had come here without Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you think about dates, a game center is an absolute must, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can have fun even without being good at the games, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">The first thing they tried was a 3D fighting game. And ten seconds after the battle started, Mao wiped the floor with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou really is strong, huh? What do I have to do to get to your level?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In these games, the muscular characters always wrestle with each other, right? I was always zoning out, just looking at them, and all of a sudden I became good without realizing it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that training method…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, fighting games are the best. Every time the male characters receive damage, they breathe so hard. It's so great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've never played a fighting game with the viewpoint of a fujoshi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that's right. Today I'm supposed to be a normal girl. I have to seal away the fujoshi inside me… No BL~… No BL~…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sounds like you're summoning the devil rather than sealing it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After suffering defeat at the fighting game, Keiki made place for the person behind him. Said person was definitely more experienced than Keiki, and a heated battle ensued between them and Mao. After that ended, Mao separated from the game with a pleased expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's go to the next game."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I have no chance of winning, I'd like to pass on any competitive ones."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How pitiful~ You might win against me in a racing game right? Come on, let's go," Saying that, Mao suddenly clung to Keiki's arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nanjou-san? Why are you clinging to my arm like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're lovers, so something like this is completely normal, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her certainly-not-small breasts were hitting his arm directly. There was no way that Mao wouldn't mind that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you embarrassed, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot… As if… I wouldn't be embarrassed…" Mao pouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">That reply was so cute that it robbed Keiki of words. Mao didn't fail to</p>
<p class="null-p">notice, and she awkwardly smiled at him as they started moving again. Even though it was extremely hard to walk like that, he still didn't separate from her. On the contrary, Keiki's heart was beating so fast that he was worried that Mao might be able to hear it. But her actual reaction was different…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kiryuu. That," she said as she stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm? Ahh, a crane game, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as the name suggested, it was a game where you'd try to grab a prize with a crane. In this game center, there were countless types of crane games with different prizes, like figurines or sweets. Anyone who liked a challenge would surely appreciate this sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In manga, this is usually where the boy tries to get a stuffed toy for the girl, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a very date-like event, so how about I try it? Nanjou, which one would you like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me see… Ah, this one there."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Mao pointed to was a cute-looking penguin toy. The penguin had a stern expression and thick eyebrows. Keiki guessed that the frozen fish in its hand was supposed to be a weapon, because the penguin was holding it its hands like a club, like it was ready to beat someone to a pulp. According to the paper on the machine, it's name was 'Sergeant Penguin.' Keiki wondered why they'd let someone with clearly no naming sense come up with that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously? …No, that's impossible…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that the boyfriend who overcomes any trouble to give his beloved girlfriend a stuffed toy is the coolest ever, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a difference between being courageous and impulsive."</p>
<p class="null-p">One attempt was 100 yen. Though judging from how difficult it looked to get that penguin, it surely would end up costing much more than that. Maybe it was because of its size, or maybe everyone had already taken the rest of the</p>
<p class="null-p">prizes, but the penguin was the sole remaining item in the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, here goes nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">In a nearby money-changing machine, he converted 1000 yen into small 100 yen coins and inserted one into the machine.</p>
<p class="null-p">But of course it wouldn't be that easy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This one's no good. I can't grab him at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what you would expect from a sergeant. He's not very easy to handle."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Keiki skillfully moved the crane on top of the penguin, the big body wouldn't move at all. If he tried to pull him up by his fish weapon, the crane just slipped off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is my last try. I can't use any more than this at a game center."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. Any more and I'd feel bad about Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was his 10th try. After putting in his last coin and pushing the button, Keiki went into full concentration mode. But in that moment, Mao suddenly moved to his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do your best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no way that he could show an uncool side when a girl was cheering him on. Even Keiki had his pride.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Right nowwwwwwwwwwwww!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fully energized, Keiki let go of the button.</p>
<p class="null-p">The crane stopped, and the claw descended on the toy. But he missed it by an inch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh… so it's no good?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment that Keiki had given up, the crane's opened arm hit the penguin on the head. Unable to withstand that impact, it lost its balance and toppled over. Just like that, the toy continued to roll down, like a golf ball, and fell into the hole.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching this unexpected incident, both of them were at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I accidentally got it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You got it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And shortly after, both of them let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu. Ahahaha. What is this? It's just like a manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just unfair. How round even is that penguin?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them had finished giggling, Keiki took out the stuffed toy and handed it to Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, your sergeant penguin."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, thank you. I'll treasure it," Mao tightly hugged the stuffed toy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her wholehearted smile, the fake boyfriend's heartbeat accelerated once more. How many times had that happened so far today?</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they continued their date without any problems. They went to a karaoke bar, did some window shopping, and so on. They must've looked like a genuine couple. Maybe it was because of the research, but Mao was</p>
<p class="null-p">strangely buoyant, and even though Keiki was well aware that she was acting, he couldn't stop his heart from beating faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, the time passed 1pm, and they decided to take a break in a family restaurant. They sat down at a table facing each other, and the penguin, stuffed in a plastic bag, found its place next to Mao. The girl ordered some cheese doria and salad, while Keiki ordered omurice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you like omurice, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I like the fluffy eggs."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about I make some for you next time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Nanjou, you can cook?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu can be really rude, I see. I'm actually quite proficient when it comes to house work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't imagine Nanjou doing house work at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, since my mother's always busy with work, I had to learn it all for myself. Same with cooking. I also prepare my own lunch box."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously. I didn't expect that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I have to skip doing that if my deadline's close."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does your mother know that you're drawing BL manga?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, she does. She's even supporting me. The same with that magazine. She said that she'd feel at ease, knowing that I could live off of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry. Talking with you about this doesn't change anything, does it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, I think it's really great what you're doing. I really like that about you, Nanjou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's really unfair if you say stuff like that," Mao muttered as she averted her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… ah, that's right. It seems like we still have some time before the food is ready."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Doria can take some time to make, after all." "Then, if I may be so bold, I'll interview Kiryuu for a bit." "Interview?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Finding out about recent trends with youngsters these days is also important data."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that the same as just gathering data about me only?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's completely different. That being said, I hope that you'll answer honestly, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It depends on the questions."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. Then, question one. What's your favorite dessert?" "Mmm… Pudding, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that's nice. Then, next. What's your favorite fruit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Peaches, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not bananas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why bananas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't like a thick, hard banana?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you stop with the analogies?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch. Then, next question."</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_12.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Mao took a deep breath and looked at Keiki with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who's the girl that Kiryuu is the most interested in right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What's with that question?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm asking about the girl you're interested in right now. Is it the president? Is it Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait wait wait wait, why did you suddenly bring up both of them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're in the same club as you, right? President is beautiful after all, and Yuika is really cute. Yuika's a half-pint, and President has those big breasts you love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not the kind of person who judges girls by their breast size, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you like big breasts, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love them!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought so…" Mao glared at Keiki with an ice cold gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">" *Cough* Putting that aside for now, I'm Nanjou's boyfriend today, so I'll only look at you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what's up with that? Disgusting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey?! I swallowed my embarrassment and tried to act like a boyfriend, and this is what I get?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa… now that you put it that way, I'm also getting embarrassed," Mao put her head in her hands and sank down on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the fact that her cheeks were burning bright red wasn't noticed by a certain boy, which made him once more unable to understand the girl's feelings. But Mao for her part certainly was happy to see that Keiki was trying his best for her. While still keeping her head down, she glanced up at</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Kiryuu. What would be your ideal kind of relationship?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Um, I guess a normal relationship would be great. It doesn't have to have that passionate development like in a shoujo manga or anything. Just a common love is fine, and it doesn't have to be special. I think a normal love with a wonderful girl would be perfectly fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So… kind of like our date today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I wouldn't mind if it was like today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that so… I see…" Mao muttered as she slowly lifted herself up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But still, I wonder if we really managed to act like lovers today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't misunderstand. We're just pretending to be lovers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, well… It feels like it's going to be some good data, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">At least Mao felt that these two close friends were doing a good job acting like a couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Though, I'm not really getting any closer to that other goal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's another goal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's nothing," Mao let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Mao were able to be honest, she would tell him that she had only used this research as a means to an end, because her true intention was for Keiki to look at her more. Mao had seen Keiki getting closer with Sayuki and Yuika, but since she was so busy with her manuscript, she was unable to obstruct them as much as she wished to.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had taken her a lot of courage to ask Keiki out on this date, even under the</p>
<p class="null-p">pretext of it being for manga research. To make sure that she had enough time, she rushed to get a lot done on her new manuscript the day prior. And there was one other, more important goal for this date. Mao wanted to close the distance between her and Keiki, even if it was just by a little bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why she held hands with him and pushed her breasts against him. However, since Keiki was under the impression that this was just for research, he didn't realize that Mao was trying to show her affection towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">REPORT THIS AD</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, why does this guy have to be so thick-headed…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's frustration only continued to grow as Keiki's reaction towards her approach only continued to fall flat. In that moment, the young maiden in love decided to play another one of her cards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kiryuu? So about what we're gonna do after we're done eating…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To get some more data, I think that we have to make this date a little bit more intense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"More intense?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. Since we're on a date, I thought-" Mai looked at her insensitive 'boyfriend' with a provoking gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a serious face, like she had finally caught her prey, the girl opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should we do something-more like what lovers do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For the second half of their date, the two of them made their way to a department store after finishing their lunch.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the two of them entered the air-conditioned store, Keiki looked around</p>
<p class="null-p">and realized that this certainly wasn't the place for a boy like him to be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Um, Nanjou-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is this place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A swimsuit store?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the store that the two of them had entered was a swimsuit store for women. And of course, the store was filled with such women, which made Keiki stand out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are we in a swimsuit store?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I want to buy a swimsuit?" Keiki's reddish-brown-haired classmate threw him a teasing smile. "I will have Kiryuu choose my new swimsuit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you think that that this is a bit too intense here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no use complaining. I won't let you go home until you decide on a swimsuit for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of punishment is this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't this what a boyfriend would normally do on a date like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be the case, but still…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Keiki's hesitation, Mao wordlessly took out her phone with a grin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I have some of my manga illustrations on my phone here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you continue to protest like this, I might just accidentally send this data here to Mizuha~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please let me choose a swimsuit for Mao-sama!"</p>
<p class="null-p">(TLC: Possible wordplay; Maou-sama = Demon Lord)</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, the fake couple started happily picking out swimsuits. Like she was a fish swimming through the ocean, Mao skillfully walked through the store, picked out some swimsuits that piqued her interest, and headed towards the dressing room. After a short amount of time, she opened the curtains and spoke a perfectly girlfriend-like phrase.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How does this look?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah… isn't that a bit too revealing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I think it's normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki froze up and could only stare at the impactful swimsuit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what about this one??"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll regret asking this… but aren't you embarrassed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shut it! I didn't expect it to be so revealing."</p>
<p class="null-p">The swimsuit seemed to be made out of the least amount of material possible, which almost made Keiki's eyes explode.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… what about this one?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was completely at a loss for words after the curtains opened once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu? Uhm… how does it look?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ahhh… it really suits you. You look cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, okay… thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, it looked like that swimsuit was made for her. The orange color gave off a very lively feeling, and it really brought out Mao's already great style. Keiki was certain that this sight was of more worth than any jewel. Even though it was just as revealing as normal underwear, looking at a swimsuit wasn't considered sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her bright legs, her cute navel, the slim line of her waist; a swimsuit perfectly brings out everything beautiful about a girl. This is probably why everyone always looks forward to summer, because they can enjoy this kind of sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I guess I'll take this one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">As the two of them agreed to the choice, they surely looked like a normal, flirty couple. In order to change back into her normal clothes, Mao once more closed the curtains, and Keiki turned his back to the dressing room. As he did, familiar voices reached his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-I didn't expect to meet Koga-san in here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's Yuika's line."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Keiki saw as he turned towards the direction of the words were a black-haired beauty wearing short pants, and a blonde-haired girl wearing a miniskirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the hardcore masochistic molester girl Tokihara Sayuki, and the hardcore sadistic little devil Koga Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai and Yuika-chan?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh, really?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A reply came from beyond the curtains as Keiki raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait?! They're coming in this store?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, come here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The curtains opened, and Mao grabbed Keiki by the arm to pull him into the dressing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">What entered his sight was his female classmate, in a rather stimulating position. Apparently, she had been about to take off her swimsuit, because the back of her bikini top was opened, and Mao was barely holding it up with her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't look over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki returned to reality, and hurriedly turned his back towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wait, why are we hiding in here, anyway?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They'll surely have a misunderstanding if they see us here, and I'd rather avoid any trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki carefully peeked through the curtains.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you also come here to buy a swimsuit, Koga-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The one from last year doesn't fit Yuika anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, are you sure that this wasn't just a miscalculation on your part? It sure doesn't look like you've grown at all. The previous swimsuit should still fit you perfectly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. Yuika hopes that you'll lose your bikini top in front of other people."</p>
<p class="null-p">As always, the two of them were hurling insults at each other. Even in a swimsuit shop, big breasts and small breasts are always engaged in fierce battle. It seemed like the two of them both had plans to buy swimsuits and</p>
<p class="null-p">coincidentally ran into each other. And they continued to spit venom at each other while they were browsed through the sortiment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good… it looks like they'll take some time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah, how long are they going to look around here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao continued to hold up her bikini top with her hands as she glanced outside the curtains. As her pure white shoulders entered Keiki's view, he hurriedly averted his eyes. While trying his best to force his eyes away from her, he focused on the conversation between Sayuki and Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I plan to bewitch Keiki-kun with a new swimsuit of mine. That way, Keiki-kun, who will finally realize my charm, will pull me to a deserted place and do with me as he pleases."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika won't let that happen. After all, he will completely fall in love with Yuika's swimsuit appearance instead. When Keiki-senpai finally becomes an obedient boy, she will ride on top of him as they walk down the beach."</p>
<p class="null-p">REPORT THIS AD</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that conversation, Mao's eyes narrowed in a displeased fashion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun seems to be really popular."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. But, for some reason, I'm really not happy about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say that, but you're actually pretty happy, right-- Huh? E-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Mao noticed a weird feeling on her body. To be precise, it felt like something was hitting Mao's butt. Something thick, long and hard-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh… Wait a second… Is this… don't tell me… A di-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, what the fujoshi imagined was a man's most important place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Kiryuu?!" D-Don't push that weird thing onto me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Weird thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't play dumb! …Ah?! N-No, stop! A-Anymore than that… stop playing around with it…!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The hard object kept pressing on her but, and Mao was unable to keep her voice down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah, sorry. The fish of sergeant penguin was hitting you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…? P-Penguin…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What was hitting Mao's butt was the 'weapon' that the stuffed toy was holding. And she had happened to mistake that for a man's little son.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-So that's what it was… Haaaah…" Realizing that it was only a misunderstanding, she let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she completely forgot that she was supposed to hold onto the bikini top. With nothing to hold it back anymore, it dropped to the floor. And just like that her breasts were completely exposed and visible to the male classmate that was with her in the same room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this small booth, Keiki's gaze seemed to be glued to Mao's chest region. Confronted with this fact, her face went red as a tomato in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-K-Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that scream, Keiki was slapped right on the cheek and he stumbled backwards out of the booth and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was about to push himself up, he realized that two beauties were looking down at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun? What exactly does this mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai? Can Yuika ask for an explanation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their voices were as cold as ice, and their gazes were equally harsh. And then there was Mao, who was furiously blushing, trying her best to hide her breasts with tears in her eyes. Even though he hadn't done anything worthy of this treatment, he could only mutter in resignation:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, I didn't do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">With no other choice, he was forced to answer the fierce questioning of the girls present. They decided to change location to a cafe since they didn't want to bother the other customers, and after the questioning was done, the date was declared over.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, of course, the drinks in the cafe all were paid for by Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they split up with Sayuki and Yuika at the train station, Keiki walked Mao home. With the setting sun at their backs, Mao looked at the boy walking next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your cheek is still a bit red."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You did put a lot of strength into the slap, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. I wasn't able to hold back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, well, I was the one at fault…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had pushed the stuffed toy's weapon against her back, and happened to see her naked upper body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm glad that I managed to gather a lot of material. I feel like I can draw something good with this. Though it might actually end up in a shounen magazine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really sorry… I didn't think that the penguin was hitting you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, you pervert… Ero devil."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really feel bad, okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm actually still mad, but let's forget about that for now. You went out of your way to help me today, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for your kind words."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Mao had forgiven Keiki, even after all that had happened. The fake boyfriend was still holding the plastic bag with the stuffed toy in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"President and Yuika were really mad, weren't they?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the two of them want to make me their master and slave respectively, after all. Though they seemed to be satisfied with our explanation when we said it was for your research."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you sure that you're not secretly happy about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let me ask you this. Would you feel happy if the same thing happened to you, but it was two boys?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, I guess I wouldn't be happy about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"See~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like you really have it hard, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you really think so, then stop using me as a model for your BL manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediate rejection. It seemed like Keeki-kun's hell would still continue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-My home is here," Mao said as she stopped in front of a five storey building. "Thanks for bringing me home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm still your boyfriend for the day, after all. It's my duty to safely escort</p>
<p class="null-p">my girlfriend home, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really had fun today… A lot of fun…" Mao looked really lonely as she said that, and continued to gaze straight at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">A soft summer breeze gently made her hair waver, and with slightly flushed cheeks, the girl slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Kiryuu…? How about we go out for serious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Are you talking about another research?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course not. I'm talking about us becoming real lovers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a delayed response."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, well, you'd only do that with the person you really love, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what if I said that I was actually in love with Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou loves me? H-How did it end up like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In my first year, you remember when I had bad luck at the lottery and was doomed to work in the library committee? You volunteered in my place. At that time, my heart skipped a beat because of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that Keiki had saved her back then. After all, he couldn't just leave her alone when he saw her sitting there, close to crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… It was because of that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love works like that, right? The trigger can be the most casual occurrence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about you, Kiryuu? Did you have fun today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, do you not like the thought of having me as your girlfriend…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I---"</p>
<p class="null-p">A situation he had dreamed of for so long: A love confession. It was the first time in his life that something like this happened. And standing in front of him was a single, cute girl. With stylish clothes, a nice hairdo, a small amount of make-up… what if she had done that to get his attention today-?</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, Keiki felt his cheeks getting hot. His heart was pounding so intensely that it started to hurt, and things like that day's date and the love letter in his room started flying around inside his read, making him dizzy.</p>
<p class="null-p">-And while he was still in shock, Mao pinched his nose and her serious expression turned into that of a teasing smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-I'm just joking~" She said and giggled.</p>
<p class="null-p">The courageous girl who just confessed was nowhere to be found anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only person standing there was a female friend who liked to tease him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was the continuation of my manga research. I tried to act out a confession scene. How was it? Don't you think that I can use this for my manga?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, so it was that. A research, huh? I think that was good. Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad. It's a shoujo manga, so a confession scene is a must."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. A shoujo manga without a confession scene is like a hamburger without meat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Kiryuu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you… get flustered?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I did not?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, so you did~ That face tells me everything~ Ahahaha, Kiryuu really is an idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay okay, I'm an idiot," Keiki said, as sighed in relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, somewhere deep inside him, he also felt a small feeling of disappointment. Of course, he kept that a secret.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'll go my own way now," he said as he handed her the plastic bag with the stuffed toy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Ah, wait, Kuryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was called, he turned around, and a soft sensation touched his cheek. He smelled a sweet shampoo scent. Mao's face seemed to be a bit flustered as she separated from him. The moment Keiki realized that he had been kissed on the cheek, the girl had already turned her back to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nanjou?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for today. See you."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was still processing what had just happened, she threw him a smile over her shoulders and escaped into her mansion.</p>
<p class="null-p">To Mao, this date was a huge success. After all, the dull protagonist's face was bright red, and it was obvious that his heart was about to leap out of his chest.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Later that day, Mao was sitting at her desk in her own room. She had a notebook and a pencil ready, and wrote down notes from the data she had collected from the date. She was wearing her glasses she only wore while being in fujoshi mode. Like this, her preparations were complete.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I've gathered enough data for today, so let's get to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the first time she would draw something other than BL manga. However, failure wasn't an option. Unlike fan-made doujinshi, she would be drawing something for an official magazine, so if either the story or quality were not up to par, she would lose her chance. The manga industry wasn't nice to newcomers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm, for now, the hero invites the heroine for a date, I guess…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She built up a story based on her memories from the date.</p>
<p class="null-p">They meet up at the train station, the girl gets praised for her choice of clothes, they hold hands, they're crossing arms, the hero wins a stuffed toy for the heroine-</p>
<p class="null-p">She tried to draw on the feelings she had when she did these things with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This feels really embarrassing for some reason…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she drew BL manga with Keiki and Shouma as models all the time, this time she herself was a model as well. Thinking that she was basically laying bare her feelings for the readers made her feel really flustered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaa… T-This isn't good. I need a break."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she worked hard for about an hour, she was unable to withstand her beating heart, so she laid down the pencil. While doing so, she glanced at the other end of the table, where sargeant penguin was sitting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This guy… every time I look at him, he reminds me of Kiryuu… But, setting that aside for now… I wonder when I'll ever have enough courage…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though she had confessed to him out of spite, she had hurriedly covered it up with a lie, because she was afraid of hearing his answer. She really hated herself for that. But she was happy that Keiki showed such a reaction towards her confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu said that he wants a normal love, right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was his dream to have a normal love, with a normal girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…If I finished this manga, and stopped being a fujoshi… would he fall in love with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she spoke these words, she felt embarrassment, and heat in her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What kind of embarrassing things am I saying… L-Let's continue!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The thing called love really was a strange thing. It made your head go crazy, and your heart went wild as soon as you thought of the other person.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she somehow managed to get back her focus on the manga. From the looks of it, she was getting close to completion-</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was a critical flaw.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, all of a sudden, the heroine turned into an ikemen…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now it was a story of a boy confessing to another boy. It seemed like no matter how much she tried to change, deep down she was a BL mangaka. Apparently it wasn't that easy to escape from the BL world. Minami Maho-sensei proved to be the biggest enemy of Mao when it came to drawing shoujo manga.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Is The Order A Cat-Eared Maid?</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki woke up, he was greeted by the cute sleeping face of a girl. The beauty lying in front of him had long eyelashes and fresh and youthful looking shoulders, which robbed Keiki of his breath as he stared at her, entranced.</p>
<p class="null-p">That beautiful girl was actually his little sister. Mizuha was using her older brother as a hugging pillow while she slept.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Mizuha in my room…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nnnn… Nnn… Nii-saaaan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha slightly moved, and then she buried her head into Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn… Nii-san… so hot…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it is. Of course you'd get hot clinging to me like that in this heat…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was only the middle of July, the sun was already doing its best, and it was only comfortable right now because the air conditioner was running. However, in two or three hours, even that wouldn't help anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the girl's thin pajamas, her softness was directly transmitted to him. And Keiki knew very well that if this girl weren't his little sister, something bad might very well happen. However, since that wasn't the case, he decided to poke Mizuha's cheek with his finger. While he was enjoying doing that, the girl slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nnn? Huh…? Nii-san's here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, good morning, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Nii-san in my bed? …Don't tell me; is this a sneak attack?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong, okay? This is my room, and Mizuha was the one who entered the wrong bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you're right. It seems like Nii-san being a siscon rubbed off on me." "How does something like that even rub off?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometimes, Mizuha used weird excuses. His little sister slowly lifted her body up and rubbed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I must've been half-asleep. I remember going to the toilet, and then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Things like that happened from time to time. And as Mizuha checked the alarm next to the pillow, her expression slightly clouded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's already past 8am. Sorry, I overslept."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's summer vacation, so sleeping in a bit isn't a problem at all, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it is. I have to keep a healthy lifestyle exactly because it's summer vacation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha really will be a fine wife in the future." "Oh? Did Nii-san just propose to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't. Siblings can't get married, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I have to go change now. I'll go prepare breakfast," Mizuha smiled kindly as she left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha really is cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was cute, good at cooking, and considerate. A girl you'd have trouble finding any faults with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That being said, I guess my summer won't be any different from usual, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Playing games with his little sister, borrowing a DVD and watching it… He'd be doing lots of things that weren't all that summer-like.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh, all the normies are probably enjoying their summer vacations right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Going on a date with their boyfriends or girlfriends, flirting at a pool or at the beach, getting excited over swimsuits…</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder why I have this dark feeling inside of me… Those normies can all just explode…</p>
<p class="null-p">Mentally cursing all the normies in the world who lived fulfilling lives, Keiki begrudgingly lifted himself up out of bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing their breakfast, the Kiryuu siblings sat down on the couch in the living room and watched TV. Currently, a news show was airing. After a story about a political scandal, the show "Today's horoscope corner" started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apparently, their horoscopes are pretty accurate most of the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really like that sort of stuff, don't you, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"All girls like it; it's in our genes. Though we try to ignore the horoscope for the day if the result is bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't a happy sugar life, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">A young maiden's magic could turn a gray-colored day into a rosy-pink one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha is a Pisces, right? Your birthday is the 3rd of March, so it's easy to remember."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san's is also pretty easy to remember since it's the 10th of October… Ah, Pisces is in the sixth spot today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's pretty normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Normal is good. After all, it makes you happy the most."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly agree. That's something I wish the club members would understand, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls from the calligraphy club weren't normal at all. And Keiki, who was constantly being led astray by them, wished for a normal daily life more than anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the horoscope continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Libra is in fourth place today!]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, it says that you're fourth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not bad, not bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki was born on the 10th of October, he was a Libra, and his luck seemed to be rather good today.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Today will a fulfilling day for you. If you are honest with the people around you, you might make an unexpected discovery!]</p>
<p class="null-p">"An unexpected discovery, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Your lucky item today is 'An email from the opposite gender'!]</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's supposed to be a lucky item?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, with as weird of timing as always, Keiki's phone vibrated, and the new email sound played.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe it's your lucky item?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder? Uhm… The subject is 'I want to meet you right now'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The mysteriousness is off the charts here. How about meeting them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I answer that email, I might be forced to pay for some shady product."</p>
<p class="null-p">They might have gotten his email address legitimately, but you really can't let down your guard with these scam emails. As Keiki was about to delete the suspicious-sounding email…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh? The sender of that… It's Sayuki-senpai. I was about to delete the email."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened up the mail, he saw that it said "Come to the clubroom immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave the house to me. I'll watch some movies here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, you borrowed quite a few since it's summer break, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha really liked movies.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was summer break, you still had to wear your uniform if you were to go to school. With that in mind, Keiki went to his room to change, and afterwards returned to the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll be going now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Wait a moment, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was about to leave when Mizuha stopped him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have a handkerchief, right? And your collar is crooked."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha walked towards him in her slippers, handed him his handkerchief, and fixed his collar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Alright, now it's better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This really makes it feel like we're newlyweds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say such weird things. Go to school already. Senpai is waiting, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. Thanks for the handkerchief. I'll see you later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeh, be careful," Mizuha said in a soft voice and smiled at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki, who had been sent off by this girl who would no doubt become a perfect wife, finally stepped out of the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Hot."</p>
<p class="null-p">About 5 minutes after he had left the house, he was already regretting it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, during summer break, the school was wrapped in a somewhat different atmosphere. Though there were some people still attending their club activities, it was significantly more calm than a usual school day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he could hear the voices from faraway sport clubs, nobody passed him at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">And while he was trudging towards the school building, he encountered Fujimoto Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's Kiryuu-kun. Been a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">One of the female student's eyes was hidden by her bangs. She was the vice president of the student council, and also in the same grade as Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san. Are you here for student council work?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. There's still some paperwork left that I have to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your job sounds as tough as always."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. So I would really like some reward for giving it my best," Ayano said. Without waiting for a response, she clung to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki was already pretty used to it, he just let it happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn… The smell of your sweat… I can't get enough. Haaah… Haah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This already counts as sexual harassment. I would like to file a complaint to an applicable institution."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, Ayano-san doesn't want to let go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're that determined?! And it would be pretty bad if someone were to see us like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. In this heat, this would only look like two people being lovey-dovey."</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, this situation certainly didn't look like Keiki was being sexually harassed. Just as Ayano had said, they would only look like a couple flirting with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean… we might as well date for real… right?" She said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Keiki looked down at her in surprise, her one eye was staring straight at him. Maybe it was because of the summer heat, but her cheeks seemed slightly flushed. And because these words came out of this cute girl's mouth, Keiki couldn't stop his heart from skipping a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we did that, I could sniff Kiryuu-kun's underwear whenever I wanted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm flattered, but I have to decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">The worst possible kind of confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, even if we really became lovers, I wouldn't let you sniff my underwear all the time anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I don't mind if you smell, you know? Rather, that only makes me more excited."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just because Fujimoto-san is weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">As usual, she was just a pervert with a cute face. It seemed like the boy she would go out with in the future was destined to give her his underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Recharging completed."</p>
<p class="null-p">She finally seemed to have sniffed him enough, and she let go with a refreshed expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your smell was even more intense than usual. I really have to be thankful to the summer heat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of response should I make to that comment…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To the olfactophile Ayano, summer was the best season. After walking beneath the burning sun for a few minutes, Keiki had gathered up quite the sweat, which was like a feast for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right, I have to properly thank you. Here, take this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A coupon for a pool in a nearby city. You can take up to five people with you. I'll give it to you, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, she had won it at a store's lottery. With the coupon, entry to the pool is 50% off for up to that number of people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You aren't going to go, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If there are too many manly smells around her, Ayano-san might actually lose control of herself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How crazy can you be…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But to Keiki, it felt like the better choice to thankfully accept this, rather than running the risk of having this dangerous individual go there herself and go crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll take it. Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't mind it. All I'm asking you to do is to keep supplying me with this magnificent smell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I cannot promise you that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mhm, what a shame. It seems like I really have to take Kiryuu-kun's underwear with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not immediately put your hand on my zipper?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The smell fetishist seemed to be in as high spirits as always, but Keiki didn't want to have his underwear stolen, so he tried his best to escape from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">After being victorious at defending his underwear, Keiki was now on his way to the calligraphy club room. While walking down the hallway, he gazed at the coupon he had received from Ayano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A pool, huh…? I guess I'll invite the girls from the club."</p>
<p class="null-p">He stuffed the ticket into his bag and headed up the second floor while thinking about this summer plan. After arriving at his destination, he opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Welcome back, Master!"</p>
<p class="null-p">What greeted him him was a blonde-haired maid. Her outfit was a maid uniform with black and white as the basic colors and it really enhanced the breast region. In addition, she was wearing black cat ears and a tail. A maid outfit with cat ears was almost foul play.</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Please don't stare like that. It's embarrassing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With an intense glare towards Keiki, Yuika's face went red, and she tried her best to pull her short skirt down.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_13.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">I wonder why girls pulling down their skirt like this has such an impact… I could probably write a 20 page paper on that topic if I wanted to…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… Why is it a cat-ears maid?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Please ask Witch-senpai about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki looked past Yuika and found Sayuki sitting on a chair, enjoying her tea while watching the situation unfold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I was bored, I made Koga-san wear this maid uniform."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So basically, it's the same as usual."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was just so cute wearing it that I thought Keiki might've wanted to see her as well. Only taking a photo would've been a waste, so I called you over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You called me here on this hot day just for that? Thank you very much!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-senpai, why do you seem so excited?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you be so kind as to let me take a picture of you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you're already taking them…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy named Kiryuu Keiki was rather honest about his own desires. The sight of Yuika wearing that maid uniform was incredibly cute. If he could, he would've taken pictures of her for all eternity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's very cute, right? Her maid appearance is really dangerous, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. She's extremely cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with both of you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's slight blushing while being praised by her Senpais was also cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But to think that Yuika-chan would calmly wear something like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did a little game with her after all, with the condition that the loser had to listen to anything the winner asked. By the way, it was a game of concentration."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a bit more, and Yuika would've won…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Do I hear the howling of a loser dog? - Ah, excuse me. Today it would be the meowing of a loser cat, I believe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki stood up, walked towards Yuika, and started scratching her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yuika didn't mutter a single word. Only her body slightly quivered from the humiliation. As the loser of the game, he had no other choice but to silently accept. And, since the sight of that was rather arousing, Keiki averted his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that it's come to this, how about we have you act as a waitress today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?! S-Something like that…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, how about you try calling Keiki-kun 'Master' one more time. And this time, with more love than last time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Understood," whispered Yuika, as she looked at Keiki with her round, cute eyes. "M… M-Master?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thuuuuuuuuump?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The impact of Yuika's 'Master' was too much for him to handle. As a result,</p>
<p class="null-p">he unconsciously spoke out the sound his heart made that second.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't good… If Yuika-chan asked me to become her master today, I might accept without thinking…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Keiki-kun, I can't ignore that. You have to become my master, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Yuika is Keiki-senpai's master!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I don't even know what's happening anymore…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl who wants to be Keiki's master.</p>
<p class="null-p">And a girl who wants Keiki to become her master.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment in time, Keiki had no plans whatsoever to say yes to either of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. Then let's test if Koga-san really is worthy of being Keiki-kun's maid. From now on, Koga-san will serve Keiki-kun in whatever way he wants."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph. Though it's humiliating to serve Yuika's own slave, letting Witch-senpai think that she won isn't an option either. Alright then, Yuika will accept this test."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's decided then. So to start, how about you properly greet your master Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's nothing special," said the cat-eared maid. She turned around and looked at Keiki with a cute smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today, Yuika will be serving Keiki-senpai as your own personal maid. My name is Koga Yuika-Since she will be Keiki-senpai's owner in the future, you should be thankful for this with tears of joy in your eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said some really scary stuff with a smile just now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's no good, Koga-san. Your master is your god, you know? You shouldn't be trying to talk down to him like that. And any rude way of speaking is also forbidden. You have to be friendly to your master, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu… Understood," Yuika accepted Sayuki's conditions with a pout.</p>
<p class="null-p">She took a deep breath, and created another perfect smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, Master, Yuika will promptly prepare some hot tea for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, hot tea on this humid day might not be the best idea…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Yuika's master seems to be a bit egoistic - Really, Master is as greedy as a pig."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master? If you want some cold beverage, you have to beg for it, okay? How about you start squealing like a pig?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've never heard of a maid calling her master a pig, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This might have been a reward for a hardcore masochists like Sayuki, but sadly, Keiki was a normal boy. For that reason, it didn't exactly fit his tastes to be insulted by the maid standing in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no question. Koga-san isn't fit to be a maid - It seems like there's a dire need for punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What kind of punishment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, I thought this might happen, so I brought some handcuffs with me. A bad maid has to suffer her master's punishment, after all. With this, you can can apply some more radical training."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I have to do it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's very unhealthy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't wanna be told that by the person who finds pleasure in kicking boys."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't want to be told that by the person who finds pleasure in getting kicked by boys."</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation between the two high school girls turned into chaos. Even during summer break, the calligraphy club room was wrapped in a heated atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, Koga-san, accept your fate and let me bind you with this rope."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't! This kind of training is impossible!"</p>
<p class="null-p">H-Hey… both of you, you can stop it already-"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Keiki stretched out his hand to stop the fight, a ominous, metallic sound rang out inside the club room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">And of course, that sound was related to the handcuffs. One end was connected to Keiki's right hand - while the other end was connected to Yuika's left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh well, this happened because Keiki-kun was about to go rampant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this really the time to add false pretext to this like that? Please take them off already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're so impatient. That's not really a good attribute for a boy to have, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What exactly are we talking about?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About your endurance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it already, so please take them off, will you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. That's impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like I left the key at home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaah?! So that means that we can't take them off, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's correct."</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Sayuki's flippant reply, Keiki couldn't help but raise his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a problem, though! Yuika can't change like this, and she can't go to the toilet either!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, going to the toilet together with a boy… Isn't that rather exciting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That just goes for Witch-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Setting aside Sayuki's fetish, this was indeed quite the pickle. With handcuffs, they wouldn't be able to change properly, and if someone were to spot a boy and a girl (wearing a maid costume) together with handcuffs, the resulting misunderstanding would be difficult to clear up. Not to mention that things could even end in suspension if a teacher were to spot them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, we really can't leave the room like this, so can't you do something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess it can't be helped. I'll go home to get the key, so wait here for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">After grabbing her bag, Sayuki turned around one more time before she left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that Koga-san can be very cute, but don't put your head inside her skirt, or accidentally touch her butt, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please just go already."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Sayuki finally left the room, which left the two of them in silence. Since their hands were connected, they pulled two chairs next to each other and sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Witch-senpai makes nothing but trouble. To think that she would forget the key."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She really can be absent-minded from time to time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her brain should be pretty good judging from her grades, but sometimes you would wonder if she weren't actually just an idiot. When Sayuki herself was wearing that maid uniform, she had also happened to drop the key into her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika can't go out wearing these clothes, so there's no other choice but to calmly wait, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that skirt's crazy short and very risqué to boot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Can you stop looking at Yuika's legs, please?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The difference between a skirt and a mini skirt is very significant. Her dazzling legs were robbing Keiki of his ability to think straight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, without an air-conditioner, you really feel the heat in here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Every room in the school should be equipped with one, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At least the fresh breeze from the open window helped cool them down a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But still, it's only July and it's already hell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika still likes it more than the cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are a lot of girls like that. Mizuha, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's easier for girls to get used to the cold after all… Ahhh, this table is so</p>
<p class="null-p">cold, it feels so good!" Yuika said as she rested her body on a table close to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he gazed at the profile of his Kouhai, Keiki took out a small bottle of tea he bought at a convenience store on the way to school. When he went to open up the bottle, he unconsciously tried to use his right hand-</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, he pulled Yuika's left hand, and the girl herself, closer to him with quite some force.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah?! S-Sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, pay some attention, will you? That really hurt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really sorry… I'm not used to using my non-dominant hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">But he somehow managed to open it with his left hand. Even something as simple as drinking was problematic for him with these handcuffs. When Keiki looked to his side, he saw Yuika, also taking a sip of her mineral water. Because of her clothes and her unnatural cuteness even while drinking, Keiki couldn't help but be entranced by her. Before he realized it, Yuika was staring straight back at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Don't stare at Yuika like that. It's embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's really that embarrassing, why did you even agree to wear that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Punishment or not, Yuika could've just said no because the order was too embarrassing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai said that she would call Keiki-senpai if Yuika wore these clothes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. It's really embarrassing to be seen in this… But Yuika wanted to make Keiki-senpai happy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words that she spoke made Keiki's heart skip a beat. After all, she was wearing this maid uniform just for him. When she had confessed her sadistic nature, she had also stuffed her white panties into his mouth, thinking that it would make him happy. It wouldn't be too far to say that this might be a sign of affection for him. However, was that affection love, respect, or something completely different?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is Yuika-chan Cinderella…?</p>
<p class="null-p">If she really was, what kind of answer would Keiki give?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn… I don't know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sighing in resignation, he took the same position as Yuika and rested against the table. Maybe it was because of the heat, but he suddenly felt very sleepy. And it didn't take very long for him to completely enter the land of dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Senpai. Keiki-senpai, please wake up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Nnn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling his shoulders being gently shaken, he opened his eyes. And what greeted him was the calligraphy clubroom. Apparently, Keiki had fallen asleep while resting on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, I completely fell asleep…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not important now! There's a huge problem!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan? Why are you panicking like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has to go to… Let…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what? I didn't quite catch that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Toilet! Yuika needs to go to the toilet! She is about to wet herself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, who was standing next to Keiki, continuously pulled down her skirt, fidgeting with her legs. Judging from that gesture, she seemed to be pretty close to her limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… The toilet should be at the end of the hallway, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika knows that! But our hands are connected because of the handcuffs!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki finally remembered their circumstances. If she really had to go to the toilet, she could've just let Keiki sleep and gone to do her business without him. But with their current circumstances, she couldn't do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, uhm, is it really okay for me to just stand there? I mean… the sound?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika already is over that! This isn't the time! She's really at her limit here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Yuika had been trying to hold it in for quite some time. Keiki didn't know for how long, but he was certain of one thing. As a man, he had to do his best so that Yuika wouldn't embarrass herself like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's go, then!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it feels a bit complicated that you're so motivated… Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika herself had quite the resistance to what was about to happen, but anything was better than wetting herself in front of her slave candidate.</p>
<p class="null-p">However - at the entrance of the new world, there was another roadblock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Not good, some girls are occupying the entrance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they opened the door of the clubroom, they saw a group of girls standing in front of the toilet, having a conversation. At this rate, there was no way for them to use the toilet. In the middle of this despair, Yuika's cheeks went bright red as she leaned against Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Senpai… Yuika… can't… keep it… any longer…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second?! Whatever you're going to do now, please hold on a bit longer!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Yuika nodded countless times. Judging from that, it really was getting close.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There's no other choice but to do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could only think of one way to solve the situation peacefully. However, it held its own risks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yuika-chan, would you take off your panties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Excuse me? W-What are you saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's necessary to save Yuika-chan. You don't want to wet yourself, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Uuu, this is getting even more embarrassing… You better remember this for later," She complained, but still proceeded to take off her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today's panties were blue with white drops on them, and they looked very cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, perfect. Then, excuse me for a second…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh? Hyaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki then proceeded to walk around Yuika's back to face her head-on, and lifted her small body up. Grabbing both her legs, which were wrapped in knee-socks, he spread her legs apart. With her legs forming an M shape,</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was completely in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Senpai?! What are you doing?!" Her face went as red as a tomato.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki ignored her protest, however, and brought her towards the open window. When they arrived there, his Kouhai's expression darkened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-senpai… Are you serious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It's summer, so one will see. And right below us are plants too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not the problem here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's better than wetting yourself in front of me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika doesn't want that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"See? There's no other way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot idiot idiot! Keiki-senpai, you pervert! What are you going to do if someone sees?" Her face was still bright red, with tears in her eyes, as she continued to hit Keiki on his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's still better than the alternative, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, with these clothes, from the window… Yuika can't believe it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for drinking that water earlier."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…! No no no no no!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to her protests, he slowly brought his mouth closer to her ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-If you aren't careful, your skirt will get wet, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing these words, Yuika's right hand went towards her skirt. But, instead</p>
<p class="null-p">of lifting it up, her hand remained on it, holding it tightly. In the end, she never lifted it up, and finally reached the critical point, which made her body shiver.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No… more…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, even with tears in her eyes, her hand on her skirt didn't move.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that ear-splitting scream of hers, the dam broke - and in that moment, Keiki's consciousness was cut.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….N? H-Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he came back to his senses, Keiki was once more resting on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Sayuki, who was sitting next to him, brought her face closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How rude. You don't have to act so shocked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was gone from the room, and instead it was the school-uniform-wearing Sayuki who greeted him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where's Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san already went home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She went home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked at his right hand, he saw that the handcuffs that should've been there were gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I came back, Keiki-kun was sleeping, so I took them off of you without waking you up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's such a shame. If you were awake, you would've seen Koga-san changing her clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That really is a shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently Yuika went straight home after having changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though, Koga-san looked like she was panicking. Did something happen? Did you put your face into her skirt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't… But, I'm glad. So that really was just a bad dream."</p>
<p class="null-p">The incident that occurred only seemed to have been a dream. Thinking back on it, Keiki's actions towards Yuika really were weird. Even if he caught her in such a weak situation, making her do her business out of the window was too much. Though it really seemed like it had been rather real, he was relieved to find that it was just a dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nnn? An email? From Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His phone chirped, signaling that a new email had just arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">[That was really embarrassing today. Please forget that it ever happened.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It was a dream… right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The embarrassing part she's talking about is her maid clothes, right? That toilet thing out the window from the second floor was just a dream, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki wanted to ask about it in his reply, he was too scared and couldn't do it. Ignorance is bliss, after all. That mystery was better kept a mystery.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what were you doing peering at my face like that, Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. I didn't do anything amoral."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That comment only makes me worry even more though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't use this opportunity to take a picture of your sleeping face, poke your cheek, or lick you, or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lick?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, should I do it again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds scary, so I think I'll pass."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki started to wonder if she really didn't do something outrageous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also, taking a picture of my sleeping face… it's not that interesting, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. I was almost dying from laughter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I really make such a hideous face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This evening, you'll have fun looking at the pictures of Koga-san in her maid outfit, right? It's the same for me. When I go to bed, I will look at Keiki-kun's photos and have fun. In a lot of ways - right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, I guess I'll go home for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. Ignoring that isn't fair. I tried my best to say that out loud."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't ignoring you a reward for this hardcore masochistic Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're such a tease, Keiki-kun. You can do it more aggressively, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder. When you're asking for it, I kind of lose my motivation to punish you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I know. That's what they call a tsundere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a tsundere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of tsunderes, Koga-san is also one, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you compared her to an animal, she'd be a hedgehog. Her caution is unnecessarily high, and she's so rebellious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because Sayuki-senpai is always provoking her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first glance, she looks cute, but her real self clearly isn't. That girl is always sulking when Keiki's not here, you know? If you left her alone, she'd just stay at home and read books."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, now that's something I know already."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was now able to wholeheartedly smile while dealing with customers in the library, it wasn't like that in the beginning. To be precise, Yuika wouldn't get involved with other people. Thinking about it, the comparison with a hedgehog might be pretty fitting for Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. That's why you called her here, Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're always fighting, but you can be pretty kind, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-?! Y-You're wrong…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm just worried about her as the club president. I have to look after my Kouhai, even if I don't like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you think of her as your kouhai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you that you're wrong. You have the wrong idea… Y-Yeah, that's it. I just used Koga-san as an excuse because I wanted to meet with Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also wanted to see Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fue?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just kidding~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?! You're going to get me excited with those kinds of words!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Here was a girl who would actually get excited by her male Kouhai teasing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But honestly speaking, I also kind of felt happy getting a new kouhai like this. It's not like I wasn't happy when it was just the two of us, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Yuika and Mao had joined the club, it had gotten more lively. Maybe it was similar to how Sayuki spent her first year in the club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Either way, I won't hand Keiki-kun over to Koga-san," Sayuki teasingly said as she grabbed Keiki's arm. "Fufu, now I will monopolize Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a dog jumping at its owner, she didn't even try to hide her happiness as she tightly hugged his arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">This person really is cute, isn't she…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was actually a pervert who liked teasing Keiki, she looked like a normal, cute girl. It was so troubling. Since Keiki didn't want her to see his red face, he averted his gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai. It's hot, so will you please let go of me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you trying to hide your embarrassment? My Master really is cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not your master."</p>
<p class="null-p">Could she actually be Keiki's Cinderella? What if, behind her wish for him to become her master, there was an actual feeling of love hidden-</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, Keiki found himself even more unable to make eye contact</p>
<p class="null-p">with the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, it was about 1pm, and Keiki had left the working Sayuki behind in the club room as he stepped out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So, who's even is Cinderella in the end?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His progress still hadn't changed one bit from before summer break.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Cinderella's panties disappeared from my room, it should've been either Sayuki or Yuika…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Cinderella had tried to hide her real identity, there was almost to chance for her to actually reveal herself. Hence, Keiki highly doubted that he would get a favorable answer from asking something like 'Are you the sender of the love letter?'. And his only proof was gone at the moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I really have to find Cinderella's panties first, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His best option would be to search through the girl's rooms, but the risk was too high. After all, something had happened with Yuika the one time he tried.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about I try lifting up their skirts every day? …Wait, that would make me a total pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki slapped himself on the head, trying to rid himself of his still-present sleepiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh? Koharu-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he walked down the stairs, he met up with his small senpai, Ootori Koharu. The uniform-wearing girl had a large box in her hands, which completely hid her small upper body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you carrying that to the astronomy club room? Should I help you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? That would be a huge help."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the box wasn't that heavy, you had to keep the size of the girl in mind here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really saved me. They were really heavy. Are your arms okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's totally fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun really is a boy, isn't he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do think that I'm as strong as your average boy. Because of the tennis club, Shouma's muscles on his arms are crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. When he pats me on the head sometimes, I can feel their sturdiness, and it makes my heart throb like crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai is still as madly in love with Shouma as ever, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course! There isn't any more wonderful boy besides him, and his smile when he sees little girls is something to die for. Ah, just recently, Shouma-kun actually-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I did it. I flipped her switch."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Koharu started talking about Shouma, she couldn't be stopped easily. While listening to that adolescent-like dialogue of hers, Keiki arrived at the astronomy club room. By now, he was completely used to being greeted by Shouma's countless pictures on the walls, so he didn't pause at all before setting down the box on a table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what exactly is in there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pictures of Shouma-kun. My locker was getting full of them, so I decided to sort through them here during summer break."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really becoming honest with yourself, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Koharu opened the box and started taking out the photos and setting them on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah, that's quite a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're interested in one, feel free to take it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I'm not interested in photos of that bastard…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Friends or not, Keiki really didn't want to own a stalker photo of Shouma. But since Koharu's photography skills were so apparent, he unconsciously picked some up. One was of Shouma hitting a ball on the tennis court, and it looked like it was taken by a professional photographer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seeing him like this, it makes Shouma look like some sort of idol…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma has the looks to become one, after all. Though that's not really good for me, since I want to be the only one looking at Shouma-kun… Ah, what kind of embarrassing things am I saying…? Really," Koharu put her hands on her cheeks as her face turned red.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her looking cute like that, Keiki felt really jealous of Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? This picture…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was looking at a single picture. As always, it showed Shouma standing on the tennis court in the evening, but in the corner of the picture, in a very tiny size, he could see a girl who was very familiar to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What is this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that picture made him leak out a doubtful voice. In the bottom right corner of the photo was the exact date and time when that picture had been taken, and by pure coincidence, it was the day when Keiki had found the love letter. However, rather than the date of the photo, the time was far more interesting to him. The picture had been taken around 6pm, which was when Keiki had already been on his way home. In the background of the photo, there was a girl walking towards the school gate. He checked it countless times.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, no matter how much he did, it was still weird. The day when he found the love letter, when he remembered back to that incident, there was a big</p>
<p class="null-p">contradiction.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, that girl should not have been there at that time, at that place-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, this is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai… I might have just found out who Cinderella is."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who had left the love letter behind in the calligraphy club room. He had finally found a trace of the girl who had sent him the letter. The letter with the words 'I like you' written in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Cinderella who dropped her panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">That photo the stalker girl had taken by pure coincidence was definite proof, and it became the glass shoe that connected him to Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: A Blessing To These Wonderful Swimsuits!</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the first of August. Even though it was still the middle of summer break, Keiki was on his way to school. On this very day, he would correct these past months where he had been drowning in chaos. He put on his uniform, left for school at his usual time, and self-studied for about two hours until the school's study period was over. After being freed from their studies, the other students went their separate ways, and the members of the calligraphy club gathered in front of the school gate. The four members were the president Sayuki, Keiki, Yuika, and Mao. In addition, Keiki's little sister was also in attendance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san, it's been a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Hello, Tokihara-senpai. It has indeed been a while." She bowed her head towards the black-haired upperclassmen. "Hey, Nii-san, what kind of gathering is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the only person who wasn't a member of the club, and she voiced her confusion to her older brother, who was standing next to her. This confusion was to be expected, since he had suddenly called her here on the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're all going to the pool after this. Since this ticket is for five people, I thought that I would invite Mizuha too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh. But you didn't tell me to bring my swimsuit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I've prepared the perfect swimsuit for you. Here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki handed her a plastic bag. Inside this bag was a cute swimsuit that would surely fit her, as well as a new towel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I'm a bit scared to ask since you're the one who brought it… Is it really going to be the right size?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For a breast connoisseur like me, guessing the size of your swimsuit is no problem at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a cautious gaze, Mizuha hid her breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, are you the kind of older brother who knows his little sister's bust size?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Mao and Yuika glared at him coldly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki didn't know Mizuha's size off the top of his head or anything. He had asked Koharu for advice on how to choose a swimsuit for Mizuha. Koharu took photos of her in order to estimate her size and helped him choose one. Though it was pretty embarrassing to buy a girl's swimsuit, it was a special surprise just for today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're always cooking for me and doing the housework and such. So I thought I'd give you this swimsuit as thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh… okay. If that's it then… thank you?" Mizuha responded, clearly confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">And since the conversation was derailing a bit, club president Sayuki took the lead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then let's head towards the bus stop. And watch out for cars."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow this feels like a grade school trip."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Koga-san looks like a grade school kid in a lot of ways. Pfft."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika isn't that small."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika is adorable the way she is. Let's see if we can get Onee-san to cast a charm so that your breast growth doesn't stop there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-senpai, you teaser…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three girls were chit-chatting gleefully. Mizuha, who was walking behind them, let out a small giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The calligraphy club really is lively."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well it's not boring, that's for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">There were a lot of different personalities in the club, so some degree of trouble was guaranteed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope I wasn't being a bother, suddenly inviting you out here like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I wish you would've told me earlier, it's totally fine. I'm happy about the present, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'm a bit worried about the swimsuit you chose for me. What if it's one of those string bikinis?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't let my cute little sister wear something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I'm just joking. I'm actually kind of looking forward to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing his little sister smile cutely like that made his heart skip a beat. Maybe there was a gap in Keiki's rational thinking. But more than that, it was probably because he was a siscon just as much as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short bus ride, the calligraphy club members and Mizuha arrived at the pool in the neighbouring city. Said pool was often advertised in magazines and whatnot under the name "Pool amusement park," and that was for a very good reason. It had a water slide, a springboard, a wave pool, and so on. It was no surprise that it was actually a very popular spot. Using their ticket to get the reduced entry fee, they went inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">After having changed in the men's changing room with countless other naked men (which would've made Mao very happy to see), Keiki waited outside for the other girls to arrive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That girl is pretty big, isn't she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was gazing at a girl passing by, he heard a voice from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for waiting, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's Sayuki-senpai right off the bat…"</p>
<p class="null-p">All of a sudden, the last boss was standing behind him. Just thinking about her overwhelming chest region, Keiki wished that she had arrived last so that he could get used to seeing a girl's breasts. But, since he had no other choice, he slowly turned around to see his long, black-haired Senpai standing there in her bikini figure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty normal! For Sayuki-senpai, it's pretty normal!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The colour was a beautiful blue, and it was unexpectedly neat and clean. To keep it short, it really suited her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I was a bit afraid of what kind of killer swimsuit you'd bring out, it's normal, cute, and it looks really good on you, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu. Right? Thanks to Imouto-san providing some information, I found out that Keiki-kun actually likes this normal kind of design."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that I like this sort of stuff… but because of those breasts, it still looks pretty indecent."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though the design was perfectly neat and simple, the swimsuit was still only barely able to hold back her big breasts, so it made it look even more erotic. To be completely honest, it was terrifically erotic. Not to mention her plump butt perfectly finished up the all-around combo, and she attracted a lot of gazes from the guys walking by.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, thanks for waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're back~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next two to appear were Yuika and Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-How is it?" Mao asked, looking weirdly nervous for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was in fact wearing the orange swimsuit that the two of them had chosen on their research date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It really suits you. You look really good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…" Mao's cheeks turned a faint red.</p>
<p class="null-p">A true tsundere, Keiki thought when he saw how flustered she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way Nanjou, why exactly do you have your sketchbook out right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that I can draw the naked bodies of the men around me, of course. It's good practice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, a random man who was passing by became the fujoshi's target.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, aren't you going to say anything to Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan is also cute, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehehe. Does it make you want to become Yuika's slave?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's swimsuit was pink with frills. Of course, combining that with her angel-like looks, it was obvious that she would also attract a lot of attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mizuha's last, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His little sister looked up at him nervously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it…? It's the best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha for her part was wearing a mint-green swimsuit with white stripes. Her cute belly, her well-formed chest, and her well-formed body were all perfect, and Keiki could only stare at her in awe, admiring that perfection. Yuika was also staring in admiration. More specifically, she was staring at Mizuha's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-senpai doesn't look that big when she's wearing clothes. Yuika is a bit envious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're not bad, right? All natural," Keiki said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you respond to that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to her older brother's sexual harassment, Mizuha once more hid her breasts with her arms.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_14.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"I hate it when Nii-san says weird stuff like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm very sorry! Please don't start hating me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki watched her Kouhai apologize like that with a cold gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-kun, you're not just a normal siscon, are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a siscon, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thinks that Keiki-senpai is a massive siscon, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how you look at it, Kiryuu is a siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san totally is a siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Weird. Everybody thinks that I'm a siscon. I wonder why?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, let's set that aside for now and have fun at the pool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'll be drawing some sketches over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like to try the wave pool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika wants to go down the water slide."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess that everyone playing together isn't an option…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There are some people who don't stay together when at the pool. Since all of them were the type of people to do their own thing in the clubroom as well, it was probably a bit too much to ask them to coordinate as effectively as, for example, a sports club.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, let's have some fun at the water slide, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Keiki-kun will come with me to the wave pool."</p>
<p class="null-p">At his right arm was Yuika, and at his left was Sayuki. Both of them were holding onto him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could both of you please let go for now? My reasoning is starting to crumble."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it was the same sort of development as always, these two girls were currently wearing swimsuits. The soft feeling of their bodies, the slippery sensation of their skin… all of this was currently pumping energy into Keiki's lower body. Keiki forced himself to remember that he currently wasn't in the safe domain of his own room, but rather a public place with people all around. And to make it even worse, hot gazes of envy were directed at him for having two beauties clinging to him like that. These gazes were filled with killing intent, which sent shivers down his spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is really popular."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's really not like that, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, this wouldn't be just a relaxing day at the pool. And, probably trying to display her breasts, Sayuki crossed her arms and declared the following.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, how about we compete for the right to play with Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds good. What will be the competition?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we're at the pool, it has to be something summer-like. Competitive swimming would bother the other guests, so how about we do it with guns, like those old western movies?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A gun stand-off, huh? Yuika accepts that duel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I don't really care either way, but it doesn't look like you don't care about my opinion anyway, does it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after, the two girls came back with rented, double-handed water pistols.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd like to nominate Nanjou-san to be the referee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood~. Since its water pistols, five steps apart should be enough, right? After five steps, you both turn around, and the one who hits the other first is the winner," Mao explained the rules to the two girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't lose, Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's Yuika's line, Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">The both of them started their preparations. Mizuha, who was standing a small distance away from Sayuki, started talking to her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, Nii-san, who do you think will win this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. Since those pistols look rather heavy, I think that Sayuki-senpai has the upper hand here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Then I'll bet a crepe on Yuika-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then I'll do the same for Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">While making their bets, the siblings looked over the duel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then - start!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Mao gave the sign, both of them started walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">…One step… Two steps… Three steps… Four steps… And finally, the fifth. In that moment, both of them turned around. However, Sayuki was a bit behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had completely forgotten that Tokihara Sayuki was a hopeless cause at everything sports-related. By the time Sayuki had finished turning around, Yuika was already done aiming, and she flashed a confident smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will win this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A spray of water shot out of her pistol and hit Sayuki right in the chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's breasts started shaking up and down from the impact.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaaaaaaannn?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, you're way too weak?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe it was because of his male instincts, but Keiki immediately focused his gaze on her shaking breasts, and it looked to him like it was in slow motion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks for the meal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having been shot, Sayuki sank down to the ground. Her cheeks turned red, and she started breathing heavily with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The winner is Koga Yuika!" Mao, the referee, declared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika took a winning pose and let out a giggle. Maybe part of why she was so happy was from seeing this "Witch-senpai" in such a defeated state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufufu, it seems like Yuika is the winner."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, Yuika gained the right to play with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika led Keiki towards the water slide. The loser, Sayuki, went to the wave pool alone, and Mao started drawing while watching the pool. Mizuha for her part decided to not be a bother, and she stayed behind as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those stairs are pretty tall."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. It is a pretty huge water slide, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">They went up the stairs and waited in line for a short while, until it was finally their turn. Keiki sat down first at the top of the slide, and Yuika quickly followed, sitting down between his legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, here? You're going to sit here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it fine? Yuika thinks that we should ride this together now that we're</p>
<p class="null-p">here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't really mind, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, please hug me tightly so that nothing dangerous happens."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Doing as he was told, he put his hands around her soft stomach. After they finished their preparations, his Kouhai turned around to smile at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Please don't let go of Yuika, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That angel-like smile made his heart skip a beat. While worrying that Yuika might've been able to actually feel his heartbeat, Keiki scooted forward, and the slide started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa… this is faster than I expected…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their speed gradually increased, and even the manly Keiki started getting a bit scared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Yuika turned her body around to tightly hug him. She wrapped her thin arms around him with all her might, pressing her breasts into his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-Yuika-chan?! What's wrong?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Actually… Yuika isn't good with water slides…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika rode it once as a kid, and now has trauma from it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why did you want to ride it?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika thought that it would be fine now since she's grown up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did you get that confidence from?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A trauma is a trauma because it's something that you can't overcome that easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, wait! I can't see anything in front of me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not being able to see anything while going down a high-speed water slide can be pretty terrifying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And your breasts! Your soft breasts areeeeeeeeeeeee-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though they certainly weren't close to Sayuki's level, they were indeed still soft. And with these soft breasts pushed against Keiki's face, both of them finally reached the end of the slide. However, Keiki's sight was still obscured as they shot off the end, so he ended up getting water up his nose and mouth, and he almost drowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">After having somehow survived the water slide with his Kouhai, Keiki let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah… Haaah… I almost paid for getting a feel of those breasts with my life…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Breasts…? Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently Yuika had finally realized what position she had used to cling to Keiki while they rode the water slide. Her cheeks were slightly flushed as she sat by the poolside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yuika was once more embarrassed by Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This time was definitely Yuika-chan's fault, though. That's what you get for going on a water slide when you're not any good with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… But, knowing Senpai's preferences, you probably weren't satisfied with Yuika's small breasts, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you say that?" Keiki started softly stroking his pouting Kouhai's head. "Yuika-chan is plenty cute already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika's white skin went red as a ripe apple when she heard Keiki's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Really, for a slave, Keiki-senpai is so cheeky…" the girl said as she stood up and turned her back to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yuika is going to go cool her head over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, wait! Yuika-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The blonde-haired beauty just walked away without stopping, trying her hardest to hide her red face with her small hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There she goes……… What should I do now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Keiki was left alone at the poolside. But when he looked around, he saw a huge mass of people gathering in one pace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's going on over there…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What greeted his gaze was a huge graffiti, written with black paint.</p>
<p class="null-p">[To K-kun. I'm waiting at the water pool. From your S-Senpai.]</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a message written on a wall near the pool. Putting two and two together, Keiki realized that this must be a message from Tokihara Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki arrived at the destination, he found his black-haired upperclassmen relaxing. Noticing that her Kouhai was approaching, she lifted herself up and looked at him with an assertive gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh if it isn't Keiki-kun. What a coincidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, a man-made coincidence. And can you not draw graffiti on the walls here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just normal black paint, so it'll go away once you wash it off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I was the one who had to actually wash it off."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided that it was his fault, so he took it upon himself to clean the wall. He felt like a kid who had done something bad at school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you have fun with Koga-san on your waterslide date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Somehow, I feel like your words are a bit aggressive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really," She averted her gaze. "Since I didn't have Keiki-kun at my side, all these strangers started talking to me, wanting me to come with them and such."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, Sayuki-senpai is a beauty, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd make sense that guys would try to lure her in, especially when she was by herself at the pool.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How irritating. Both my body and my heart already belong to Keiki-kun, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not say things that could easily be misinterpreted?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The only thing that piqued their interest about me was my breasts, don't you think? They only spoke to me because they wanted to have their way with them. Really, just the mere thought of it gets me excited!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's not go overboard here. There are kids around."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Sayuki seemed to be in quite the bad mood. Maybe she was still mad about Yuika winning the right to play with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, why are you still here at the wave pool?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, isn't it…? I like the wave pool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Why's that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…When I was younger, my father took me to the sea once. Because I couldn't swim, my father held my hand the whole time. Because of that, I was so happy, and I had so much fun. I could never forget about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe these artificially created waves seemed nostalgic to her, which is why she immediately gravitated to this wave pool.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait… Sayuki-senpai can't swim?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu… Yes, that's right. I'm sorry for having bad coordination."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see. So you were sulking here because you can't swim in the pool normally."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…For some reason, Keiki-kun today seems like even more of a tease than usual."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that response, Keiki giggled like a child and grabbed her by the hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I will be the one to hold your hand today. Shall we go in together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them slowly entered the wave pool, and Keiki softly pulled Sayuki along with both of his hands. Every time a wave hit them, their shoulders disappeared into the water, and Keiki felt Sayuki's grip on his hands tighten.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-Don't let go, okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't let go."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki was enjoying that cute reaction, a big wave came closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaa?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them were swallowed by the water, only to surface again shortly</p>
<p class="null-p">after.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, that was a rather big one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that isn't anything to laugh about - wait, ahhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This really wasn't anything to laugh about. After all, two big problems of Sayuki's upper body were completely exposed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai - Sayuki-senpai, your swimsuit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's bikini top had disappeared to some unknown place. And right now, her big breasts were in plain sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai, your breasts! Hide your breasts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh? Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having finally realized her situation, the girl's face went bright red. Maybe it was from the shock of it, but she couldn't react immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Senpai, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he didn't want anybody to see her like that and make her feel ashamed any more than she already was, he tightly hugged her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Keiki-kun…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. This is an emergency situation, so please bear with it."</p>
<p class="null-p">That soft feeling directly pressed against his body toyed with the boy's ability to think, but he had to ignore it for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… What should we do now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Keiki would have to search for her bikini top eventually, he couldn't just leave Sayuki here like this. Luckily, a reddish-brown-haired girl came to their rescue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You people, what are you doing in a public space like this?" Mao spoke to them in a disgusted tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she looked like a goddess to Keiki. One able to save both of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou! Perfect timing! Please look for Senpai's bikini top!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, so that's what it is. Okaaay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming to understand the situation with just that brief command, Mao dived into the pool and started searching for Sayuki's bikini top. And until Mao returned with said bikini top, Keiki and Sayuki were forced to stay in that position.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao found the bikini top rather quickly, and Sayuki bowed down to her saviour as they stood back at the poolside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much for finding my bikini top for me, Nanjou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. It felt like a treasure hunt, so I had my fair share of fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike Sayuki and her lack of swimming ability, Mao had looked like a human fish as she swam through the pool.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And Keiki-kun too… Thank you… for protecting me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I should apologize since I couldn't come up with anything better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. I was really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki stared blankly at the girl's face, and her face turned as red as a cherry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu… I-I'll go rest for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah, Sayuki-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His upperclassmen ran away as fast as her feet could take her. Mao looked</p>
<p class="null-p">after her with an astonished expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu is quite the sinful man…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what I said. Well, you're completely fine just the way you are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could only tilt his head in confusion while the girl nodded in understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, Nanjou. What about your sketches? Are you done already?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, yeah. When I got too excited and started drawing the real deal, the staff found me. I was about to get kicked out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really shouldn't draw R-18 stuff in public places…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't quite on the same level as Sayuki's wardrobe malfunction. After all, Mao's drawing had the power to inflict great trauma upon a growing child's psyche.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They confiscated my sketchbook, so I thought that I'd have some normal fun myself. After all, it would be a waste not to go swimming after coming all the way here. Perfect timing, though. Come with me for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind, but where are we going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm~ If we're gonna swim, then the pool should be fine, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, Mao started walking, and Keiki followed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me… How did things go with your shoujo manga?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, well… I'm having a bit of trouble with it. It's pretty difficult. If it was a BL manga, I'd have no problems, but I can't just draw it like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time that I've actually had problems coming up with a good story. In that regard, Yuika is pretty amazing. She can come up an entire world in the blink of an eye."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't use her talent as reference."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, Yuika's work was the hybrid of a children's picture book and hardcore sadism. The contrast between the cute drawings and the content was a sight to behold. The story of the princess disciplining her beloved prince could make a lot of readers excited, in a lot of ways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. I might need Kiryuu to help me out with another kind of research."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't mind helping you out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Yay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike her normal deadpan expression, Mao actually showed him a beaming smile. And in the very next second, Mao slipped as she stepped on the wet floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waahh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Losing her balance, Mao's back fell backwards, hitting Keiki's chest. Her shoulders were unexpectedly delicate, which made him once more realize Mao's feminine charms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… Yeah. Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, it'd be bad if you fall over again," said Keiki. He grabbed Mao by the hand as they started walking again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having her hand grabbed by a boy like this, Mao could only stare at it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Really, Kiryuu is so unfair."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the thick-headed bastard she directed these words to still didn't realize how hard Mao's heart was actually beating because of that surprise attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">After spending some quality time with Mao at the pool, Keiki was now on his way to the hot spring pool. Arriving there, he was greeted by a girl he was very familiar with. She was a cleaning freak, and since she loved taking long baths, he figured that he would meet her here. She seemed to be having fun, floating in the water with floating ring and humming something to herself. Keiki raised his voice and called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you really were here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noticing the presence of her older brother, she got off the floating ring and came towards him. For some reason, she was hiding her hands behind her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're alone, Nii-san? Where are the other girls?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're all off doing their own thing. And Mao said that she was hungry so she went to get some fast food."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Then, how about you come in too, Nii-san? It feels really good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I might as well… Ohh wow, it's so warm."</p>
<p class="null-p">The water only went up to Keiki's belly, so it wasn't all that deep. It was quite a different feeling from the pool he had been in a few minutes before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me. Thank you for this swimsuit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you like it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I think that it's pretty cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear that. When I went to buy, I was so embarrassed that I felt like I would die."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is a hero."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My next trial will be buying underwear for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn, that would be taking it a bit too far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha, figures."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them let out an awkward laugh. However, that changed a moment later, when the older brother's face was bombarded with a stream of water.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gubfuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu?! -W-W-What was that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki checked to see where that water had come from, he found the same water pistol that Yuika and Sayuki had used earlier. This time it was in Mizuha's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha-san? Why do you have such a dangerous item?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I rented it. I thought that I could use it when Nii-san came."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you aiming for your Onii-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Out of anger."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this a late rebellious phase?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's Nii-san's fault for leaving his cute little sister alone and going off to play with other girls," Mizuha's lips slightly shook as she averted her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was basically the same thing as admitting that she was jealous.</p>
<p class="null-p">How can a living being as cute as her even exist…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Here was a older brother who could think such things about his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I hug you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No… But, I might forgive you if you play with me for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your wish is my command!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but first I have to go get a floating ring."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just beyond his little sister were several floating rings, lying on the ground. Mizuha was about to walk over to grab one, but she suddenly raised her voice with an "Ouch?!" and her face distorted in pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhuuu… My leg cramped up all of a sudden."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… I'm glad that the pool isn't very deep," Mizuha said, but tears were forming in the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when she was younger, Mizuha was the type of person who would try not to worry the people around her. She always kept quiet when she was in pain or uncomfortable. Either physically or psychologically. When she got a fever, or when she was feeling down, you had to watch over her carefully or you would miss it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. It'll go away soon, so please wait a second."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot. As if I could leave my little sister alone when she's making that face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?…Woah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without hesitation, Keiki picked up Mizuha in a "princess carry," as it's normally called, with her shoulders and legs in his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you're amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's easy. Mizuha is very slim, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad. If you said that I was heavy, I might have had to eat salad for dinner this evening."</p>
<p class="null-p">"An unnecessary diet isn't good for your body, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Something like this has happened before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When we were still small, I tripped and scraped my knee. Nii-san back then carried me on his back. Even though Nii-san wasn't nearly strong enough, you still didn't give up. In the end, our father saved us… and I was sort of reminded of that just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't remember it at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We were still kids back then," Mizuha said, as she let out a quiet giggle. "Nii-san really grew up into a man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha also grew up. Especially in the breast and butt regions."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san you pervert…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While carrying on this altruistic conversation, Keiki brought Mizuha to the rim of the pool and sat her down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it'd be a good idea to rest for a while. I'll go get the floating ring."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, thanks… Ah. Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he turned around, Mizuha was looking straight at him. With flushed cheeks. And eyes that made her look like she was an animal in heat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at Mizuha from this close distance, for some reason, his heart started beating like crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, why am I getting excited from looking at my little sister?</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mouth opened and closed a few times, maybe in hesitation. It looked like she had something important to say, but she couldn't find the right words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, Nii-san? Actually… I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She tightly gripped her hand in front of her chest, and finally opened her mouth, apparently having steeled her resolve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually… I don't mind if Nii-san likes boys!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Time stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, Mizuha, Onii-chan seems to have misunderstood something. Can you repeat that again for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind if Nii-san likes boys?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In his little sister's mind, he was apparently someone who liked boys. In response, Keiki's head wasn't able to keep up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, today I saw the manga that Mao-chan made."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was really surprised to find out that she was actually a mangaka. She's really good at drawing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-How did you see Nanjou's…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well. As thanks for giving her advice on her swimsuit, Tokihara-senpai</p>
<p class="null-p">showed me in the dressing room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, Keiki really wanted to slap her on the butt. Come to think of it, those big breasts also needed some disciplining.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha already knew about both Sayuki's and Yuika's hidden personalities. However, Keiki had tried his hardest to hide the fact that Mao was a fujoshi. He didn't want his little sister to find out that he was a model for a BL manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one thing I wanted to hide from her…</p>
<p class="null-p">While Keiki's was caught up in his inner conflict, Mizuha's cheeks turned slightly red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it was the first time I'd ever seen such a book, it was… how do I say it… the world was very stimulating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come back! Don't open the door to that world!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want his cute little sister to end up like Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once we get home, I'm gonna confiscate all of her magazines and burn them…</p>
<p class="null-p">He had to do everything in his power to seal off the gate that would lead her down the same road as Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't judge Nii-san just because he likes boys, okay? I'll even cheer you on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm completely normal, okay! That manga is fiction! Pure fiction!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Tokihara-senpai said that you were very happy to be a model?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, Sayuki-senpai will get some punishment after this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it would probably bring pleasure to her rather than pain, he would not forgive her easily. There was a very clear need to bring this hardcore masochistic girl to tears, and to make her realize that Keiki was not to be crossed. She needed to learn the weight of her actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Side Note: Said actions had resulted in Keiki's little sister finding out about him being a model for a BL manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was now around 2pm in the afternoon. Since they were craving something to eat, all the club members gathered at the fast food corner inside the building. They were all sitting at a round table, and from Keiki, it went clockwise: Sayuki, Yuika, Mao, and then Mizuha. For some reason, though, there was an awkward atmosphere between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" While putting some yakisoba in her mouth, Sayuki was constantly</p>
<p class="null-p">glancing at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" While taking bites of her crepe, Yuika looked up at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" Mao was tapping on her phone, while checking Keiki every now</p>
<p class="null-p">and then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, every single club member was being wary of Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this weird situation…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could only tilt his head in confusion as he was stared at by the beautiful girls around him. The boy continued to munch on his takoyaki, without knowing that his actions from before were the cause of their wariness. And, possibly noticing the awkward atmosphere, Mizuha spoke up to her older brother from his left.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san, did you do something to them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, I absolutely have no idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? -Ah, do you also want a bite of my crepe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'll gladly take one… *Chomp*…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it's delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, you have some cream on your cheek."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, let me wipe it away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a wet napkin, she softly wiped away the white cream on his cheek. Normally, only a couple could achieve this level of closeness, but this was something natural for the two siblings. After all, Keiki was an obvious siscon, while Mizuha had slight brocon tendencies. All of the other club members watched the two of them with astonished expressions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…They totally look like a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…They really don't give off that sibling vibe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Siscon."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki, Yuika, and Mao all let out what they were thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay okay, I'm a siscon. Mizuha is the one I love the most in this world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, saying that in front of everyone is a bit embarrassing…" Mizuha said, with slightly flushed cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other three girls continued to stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Imouto-san is just as much of a brocon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Thanks for the food."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Wouldn't this be pretty great if both of them were boys?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey. I can not and will not ignore that last comment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then make her Keiki's little brother and name him [Mizuki]… Fu, fufufufufufufufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come back! Return from the word of boy's love!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't allow Mizuha to also become a BL model like him. Though to be honest she would probably turn into an ikemen like Shouma, but he couldn't ignore the horrendous scenarios that Mao might think of.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, while Keiki and the others were spending their lunch break like that, a sound rang out inside the building.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Ding dong ding dong*</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly after, the voice of a woman could be heard from the speakers nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">[-Today around 5pm, there will be a special event on the big stage inside this building. The winners will get a fantastic prize, so we hope there will be a lot of participants.]</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, the announcement stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, so they're having an event here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like it. How about we all go check it out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh? Yuika isn't all that interested."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not really feeling it either~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, who was only interested in books and Keiki, and Mao, who was only interested in BL manga and Keiki, both voiced their disinterest. In addition, it seemed like Mizuha didn't have any particular opinion. She continued to silently chew on her crepe.</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment, a rather familiar voice entered Keiki's ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Won't you take part in the event? Won't you take part in the event?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he turned towards the source of that voice, he found a small girl with her hair in two buns.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Won't I take part in the eve- Ah? Ahhhhhhh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When their gazes met, she dashed towards him and tackled his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guha?! Wait, what?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun! Save me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? K-Koharu-senpai?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The real identity of that girl was actually Ootori Koharu (3rd year), who was wearing a school swimsuit. As always, she was cute and lovable, and she totally looked like a grade school kid. And having her name "Koharu" written on her chest only contributed to that image.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai, who is this girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh right, Yuika-chan, you don't know her, right? This is Ootori Koharu-san, who's actually a third-year Senpai at our school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, really? She's even tinier than Yuika…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the girl who's always together with Akiyama, right? I really can't see her as a Senpai though…" Mao gazed at Koharu.</p>
<p class="null-p">After separating from Keiki, Koharu bowed her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nice to meet you. I'm Ootori Koharu. Just as Kiryuu-kun said, I'm actually a third year."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Koharu had known every member of the calligraphy club besides Sayuki before now, this was their first time meeting Koharu. After she finished her introduction, Keiki continued the conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Koharu-senpai, what did you mean by 'save?'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I'm working part-time here at this pool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Part-time? Isn't Koharu-senpai the daughter of a company chief? Is there really any need for her to work part-time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, uhm… there's a boy that I would like to give a present to…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Keiki immediately knew that this present would be for Shouma, which made him feel rather envious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And even though it's my first day here, I was suddenly given the responsibility for today's event, but we just can't get enough participants! So I'm trying to gather them by walking around!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was indeed pretty harsh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know much about the event, but is it really that hard to gather participants?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing Keiki's question, Koharu's face twisted in displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm guessing that it's because the prize isn't very tempting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what's the prize?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bottle of kitchen cleaning supplies."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuuuuuuuuh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The prize greatly surpassed his expectations. Even Yuika had an astonished expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course people wouldn't get excited because of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It figures… If only we could make it 10 bottles…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that's the problem here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, after Keiki responded to her statement, Mao realized something and opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? But they just made that announcement even though you don't have enough people?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. The one responsible for it said that it'll still take place, even if we don't find enough participants. And if we don't find any more people, I will have to participate in the event alone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Koharu really was in a dire situation. Since they weren't exactly strangers, and she was technically his friend's girlfriend (in name), he couldn't leave her alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh, then about I participate?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is a shame, but only girls can participate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…? Then I really can't participate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but how about you put on a bikini and act like a girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wholeheartedly decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">He still had nightmares from when he was forced to wear a bunny girl suit. And he certainly didn't want to broaden his horizons by adding a bikini to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then how about we join in?" Sayuki offered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really? Tokihara-san, you're going to join?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. And not just me, but every member of the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Witch-senpai?! Why are you suddenly deciding that on your own?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with that? I didn't agree to any of that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Yuika and Mao voiced their disagreement. Completely ignoring them, the upperclassmen turned towards the girl who wasn't a club member.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you're here already, how about you also join, Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being suddenly pulled into the conversation, Mizuha looked at her in surprise. Now that even his beloved little sister had been asked to participate, Keiki couldn't keep quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Sayuki-senpai. Even if you say that, you don't even know what the event is. I won't let Mizuha participate if it's one of those swimsuit contests, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really an overprotective siscon older brother, alright. Ootori-san, can you explain the event in more detail?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course," The school-swimsuit-wearing Koharu nodded and started her explanation. "This isn't that sort of indecent event or anything. It's a straightforward battle between girls to see who can bring out their summer charm the most!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Koharu showed a flyer to Keiki and the others. According to the flyer, the name of the event was "Sparkly Cute Girls Gathering! The Lovey-Dovey Confession Tournament!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we anticipated that a lot of men would be present in the audience, it is a battle of whose confession gets them the most excited!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This is quite the sketchy-looking event…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To begin with, the reason that no participants had gathered was probably because of the contents of the event.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika doesn't want to participate in that, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I actually have to go home now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Yuika and Mao once more voiced their disinterest…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Participating in such an embarrassing event seems like it will be a punishment… It's so exciting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's only Sayuki-senpai though," Keiki responded to Sayuki's hardcore masochistic statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, everyone is so selfish - Then how about this? The winner of the event gets the right to give Keiki-kun any order they want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! Me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly the girls changed their tune.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika will participate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Meh, I guess I might as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I will also join in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nii-san is the prize, then I will join too, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that, it was decided that the girls would participate in the event.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing the girls off, Keiki sat on a chair in front of the stage and waited for the event to start. All around him a lot of male viewers had gathered, probably because this event was targeted at exactly their demographic. And about 15 minutes later, a person who seemed to be the emcee walked onto the stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello everyone! I hope that you all are having a good day. Thank you so much for gathering here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a girl with a small body stature and a mic in her hand, wearing a school swimsuit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Ootori Koharu, and I will be your emcee for this event!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Koharu-chan appeared, the male audience reactions followed…</p>
<p class="null-p">"So they're letting a grade school kid work here~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This has to be a violation of labor laws!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lolis really are the best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki had to turn around to make sure that Shouma wasn't sitting in the audience. When he saw that it wasn't him, Keiki started worrying about the future of the country since the amount of lolicons was higher than he had anticipated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might not look like it, but I am indeed a high school student! I'll even be a university student next year!" The girl pouted as she responded to the voices from the audience.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Koharu finished her introduction, the participants entered the stage. Said participants were Sayuki, Yuika, Mao, and Mizuha, all of them wearing their swimsuits. Of course, gathering four beauties like them would result in quite the tumult in the audience, and the audience responded as you might expect. One of the participants, Sayuki, raised her voice and spoke to the emcee.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, Ootori-san, that school swimsuit fits you so well it's almost criminal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much. How about Tokihara-san also try to wear one?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd probably be arrested for public indecency."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki completely agreed with that statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's right about that. Sayuki-senpai's breasts in a school swimsuit would be clearly illegal…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition, if Sayuki were to wear a school swimsuit here, they might have had to call an ambulance since a lot of the male audience might collapse from</p>
<p class="null-p">blood loss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, today's event is a confession tournament! The rules are simple. The participants are going to pretend that they're currently standing in front of their beloved one, and they'll confess right here! The judges will be everyone in the audience! We will judge how much you're clapping, screaming, or whatever with a machine, and the girl with the highest points is the winner!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, that seems simple enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The prize of this event is a new kitchen cleaning product that just released recently!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's all?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone present responded at the same time. Koharu of course understood their confusion, so she hurriedly kept talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This was exactly the reason why we couldn't gather enough participants. However, just before the deadline, these cute girls decided to join us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, the atmosphere in that place took a 180.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's start immediately! Entry number one! Gifted with both beauty and intelligence, the black-haired beauty, Tokihara Sayuki-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Sayuki stepped to the front of the stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's start with a self-introduction first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Tokihara Sayuki. I'm a third-year student in high school, I'm also the club president of the calligraphy club."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As a member of the calligraphy club, you're even talented enough that one of your works won a competition, right? So who is this boy you're going to confess to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's my Kouhai in the calligraphy club. He's one year younger than me,</p>
<p class="null-p">and he's really cute. His face gets red so easily when I tease him, and he's always very cute. That's why I really love him."</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking the microphone in her hand, Sayuki's soft voice filled the place, and both her voice and her kind words reverberated inside Keiki's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This Sayuki-senpai… I'm gonna get the wrong idea when she says that she loves me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Keiki had been disappointed countless times after she had said something similar, he couldn't stop his heart from skipping a beat upon hearing these words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then it's confession time. Please express your feelings to this Kouhai-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Sayuki took a deep breath. And, lifting both her breasts up with her arms to emphasize them, she focused her gaze on the audience. Or rather, on Keiki, who was currently present in that audience.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you accept my feelings, I'm ready to give you my everything!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the male audience had leaned forward in their chairs in silence. However, shortly after, a wave of cries and whistling followed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"92 points! Amazing! We've already crossed the 90 point mark with the first entry! Just what you would expect from the male audience! They're completely honest with their desires!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Somehow I feel some ill will from the moderator here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just your imagination. Anyway, this 'Kouhai-kun' seems to be quite the lucky guy, being confessed to by such a beauty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Koharu already knew the identity of this 'Kouhai-kun', but she continued as if nothing was wrong. After Sayuki's confession, the whole audience was excited, but the same couldn't be said for the person in question: Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was basically the same as her saying 'Please become my master,' right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only the people involved knew very well that behind this lovable confession, there was actually another meaning, namely Sayuki's wish for Keiki to make her his pet. However, even though Keiki was well aware of that, he couldn't do anything to stop his heart from skipping a beat despite it all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, let's move onto the next one! Entry number two! The blonde-haired niche quarter-size beauty, Koga Yuika-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Blonde hair and blue eyes. Her body was coloured in foreign colors, and she gave off the vibe of a true angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuu… Yuika isn't an exhibit, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san is a member of the library committee, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, how do you know that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ootori-san here knows everything. But still, Koga-san really is cute. And so small… I really hope you stay away from Shouma-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu greatly confused Yuika when she muttered these words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cough Anyway, what is the boy that you are interested in like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… He's a Senpai from the same library committee as Yuika. He's always looked after her, and he taught her the ropes at her job. And when Yuika was troubled by some other men, he took her hand and saved her," Yuika giggled happily as she seemed to remember something.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in the next moment, her expression turned into one of loneliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this Senpai has many cute girls around him, and it gives Yuika a very bad feeling. That's why she has something she wants to tell him today!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she declared that, her blue, gemstone-like eyes looked straight at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai! Yuika won't forgive you if you chase after other girls!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short silence, the audience that had been listening to the confession gave its response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now let's see, Koga-san's points are - oh my! 95 points! Tokihara-san's points have already been beaten! Maybe it was because of the gap moe, with those angel-like looks but aggressive confession! This 'Senpai-san' really is someone to be jealous of, by being confessed to by such a cute girl!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the audience also gave its opinion on Koharu's statement:</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Normies should just explode!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to play twister with Yuika-tan! Haaahaaaa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki heard that last person, he wished that he would be arrested by the police as fast as possible. But even Keiki thought yeah, that wouldn't be too bad, which made him feel like turning himself in, as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, it seems like this is Yuika's win, Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We don't know that yet. A miracle might happen that gives me more points at the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't like a quiz where you can get bonus points at the end…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though both Sayuki and Yuika were once more chatting on friendly terms at the back of the stage, the event wasn't quite over yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, the next person! Entry number three! The tsundere with a side-tail, Nanjou Mao!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a tsundere, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That phrase alone makes you a tsundere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-san, a self-introduction, if you would."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, uhmmm… Hello, I'm Nanjou Mao."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-san is really good at drawing, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you know that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what kind of boy piqued your interest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… He's my classmate and my friend. How do I say it? It's always fun when I'm around him? Something like that. But for me, he's not just a simple friend, but rather an existence that's very precious to me… Ahhh, for crying out loud!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably got embarrassed while trying to explain. And her face turned red as she grit her teeth, which was pretty rare for Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Anyway, what I want to say is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And of course, as she lifted her head, she also gazed into the audience.</p>
<p class="null-p">Straight at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm only looking at you, okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the exact moment everyone in the audience realized that she truly was a tsundere. A simple approach is wonderful in its own way. And, it seemed like the men watching her took quite the liking to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my! 98 points! The highest number in the history of this tournament!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this isn't the first time they've done such a tournament…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was probably even more surprising than Mao's high score.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that really was an impressive confession! If I were a boy, I'd also want to be told something like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like Koharu said, it really had a lot of impact.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But in Nanjou's case, she only sees me as a sample for her BL manga though…" Keiki muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nobody would think that her true love was actually the world of BL, and not the person she had just confessed to. Her passionate gaze wasn't one of affection, but rather the gaze of a painter looking at the model in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, I'd be lying if I said that it didn't make my heart flutter, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">If he hadn't known her circumstances, that confession might have won him over. After all, tsunderes can have quite the impact when they're actually honest.</p>
<p class="null-p">The confession of the third club member had ended, and it was now time for the last girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And now we've arrived at the last participant! Entry number four! The world's cutest little sister, Kiryuu Mizuha-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hello. I'm Kiryuu Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-san is good at housework, right? I really look up to those sorts of girls. So what kind of boy are you interested in?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhm… I actually have an older brother. Though he always tells me that I'm cute, he's sometimes too much of a siscon, and it's troubling me a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, she showed the audience a warm smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But he always says that my cooking is delicious, and he sleeps with me after we've watched a scary movie, and this daily kindness is something very precious to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She once more showed a gleeful smile as she opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And this Nii-san… I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's eyes slightly turned towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really love him! …You know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time around, it was a straight confession. And in response to that, the whole male audience screamed at the top of their lungs. Keiki thought that they were all idiots.</p>
<p class="null-p">"120 points?! It broke the limit of our measuring device?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhh, am I actually pretty amazing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A girl that loves her Nii-san this much really is cute, after all! So with that, the winner of his tournament is Kiryuu Mizuha-san! Please, a round of applause!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling happy and embarrassed, Keiki was unable to directly look at the stage, and just hung his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again… Why is my heart beating this fast because of my little sister…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That confession from Mizuha was only towards a treasured member of her family. And even though Keiki knew that full well, the impact was still immeasurable.</p>
<p class="null-p">And like that, Kiryuu Mizuha was declared the winner of the tournament.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside a building with an indoor pool, on the stairs close to the second floor, Mizuha's silhouette could be seen. From that place, you could see outside the building through the windows. Mizuha had changed back into her school uniform, and she was now just gazing at the orange-colored evening sky. When Keiki called out to her, her still-wet hair softly waved as she turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We still have to wait a bit longer for the bus, it seems."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see," Mizuha gave a short reply, and started smiling as she seemed to remember something. "The pool was really fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We almost managed to make the event a success." "I didn't think that Mizuha would actually win it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As my siscon Nii-san, what did you think of my confession?" "Nnnn… Well, it made me really happy, that's for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two siblings reminiscenced about the events of that day. Both both of them were wearing their school uniforms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll make sure to put my prize to good use, okay? The one where I can give you any order."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't make it too hard for your Onii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike the perverts from the calligraphy club, Mizuha probably wouldn't do anything weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, is it fine not to go meet up with the others?" "I don't mind. I wanted to talk to Mizuha anyway." "? Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe realizing that something was off, Mizuha slightly tilted her head. "-Mizuha, sorry. Let me apologize in advance." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even before Mizuha could reply, Keiki lifted up her skirt.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_03_15.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was his most beloved person in the whole world, he did something as embarrassing as that to her. For the girl, it was something she had not anticipated at all, so she could only stare at her older brother in astonishment, without even trying to pull her skirt back down. However, that state of shock only lasted for a short bit. She regained her senses and pushed her skirt back to its original position.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this one moment was plenty enough for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way that he could mistake it. The day he had found the love letter, there was a pair of panties left behind as well. And the pair the girl was currently wearing was that exact same pair of white panties. Keiki knew exactly what that meant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha - so you were the one who sent me the love letter."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without even being mad that he had suddenly flipped up her skirt, Mizuha just replied with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So I've been found out."</p>
<p class="null-p">She admitted to being the person who had sent Keiki the love letter.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's take a moment to explain why Kiryuu Mizuha was actually wearing those pure white panties at that moment. You can just call this the viewpoint of Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had taken back the pure white pair of panties from Keiki's room. Now, of course, she would have to try her best to hide those panties from him. And where would the safest place actually be?</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, she could keep them relatively safe in her own room. However, Cinderella herself stole those exact same panties from Keiki's room. She herself knew more than anyone that one own's room wasn't actually the safest place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then what should she do? The answer was simple. She should just keep them with her at all times.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the season changes to summer, it's not weird for female high school students to keep an extra pair of panties. A girl's panties were small and compact, so it wasn't very difficult to keep a spare in her beg.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that was what Keiki was aiming for.</p>
<p class="null-p">He invited everyone out on this school day beforehand - except Mizuha. Of course, there was a reason that he didn't tell her the destination, too. Just like the surprise swimsuit, all of it had been planned by Keiki. All of it was in order to make her wear Cinderella's panties.</p>
<p class="null-p">After playing in the pool, she would of course change back into her normal uniform. But there was no way that she could've prepared another pair of panties - except the one she had been hiding in her bag this whole time, of course.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now she had two choices.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first choice was to put on the used pair of panties she had been wearing until that point.</p>
<p class="null-p">The second choice was to wear Cinderella's panties, which she hadn't prepared beforehand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, what was one of Mizuha's particular personality traits?</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, she was a clean freak. She would've hated the feeling of wearing those used panties again. Even the boy Keiki always avoided wearing the same pair of underwear twice in the same day. After all, during this humid summer weather, sweating was a normal thing to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with all this in mind, Keiki deduced that she must be wearing Cinderella's panties today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So everything today was planned in order to make me wear these panties, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Otherwise I wouldn't have any definite proof, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the stairs inside the pool building, Cinderella asked the prince a single question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did you know that it was me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because of this picture."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Keiki took out of his pocket was the single picture that Koharu had taken. Though it was originally taken because of Shouma, it clearly showed Mizuha walking in the front yard of the school grounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This photo was taken on the day that I found the love letter. The photo was taken around 7.50pm. Having finished everything in the clubroom, I was already on my way home at that time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, this single photo had turned the key and revealed Cinderella's identity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That day, the cleaning operation ended around 5pm. All of the other</p>
<p class="null-p">members of that operation were supposed to have gone home already. So why was it that Mizuha was still at school at that time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the time, Mizuha had said that she wanted to go home to take a shower. However, it was actually Keiki who had gotten home first. And since her older brother was too busy thinking about the love letter, he didn't realize that Mizuha hadn't gotten home yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking about it, there's only one reason. Sayuki-senpai wasn't the last person in the room. You put the letter on the table, hid yourself in the locker, and escaped from inside the room after I went home."</p>
<p class="null-p">The last person who left the room wasn't Sayuki, but Mizuha. She had just lied about it, in order to hide the truth. And since she lived in the same house as Keiki, it was rather simple for her to steal the panties from his room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I didn't search inside your room. I never saw you as a Cinderella candidate, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just like the math problem he had helped Yuika with before. If you can't get to the answer, then the whole premise is wrong to begin with. He had decided upon the fact that his little sister Kiryuu Mizuha couldn't be Cinderella, and that's why he was unable to find her until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everything you said is correct, Nii-san. I left the love letter there. I just thought that my feelings had to reach Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was talking about her feelings on that fateful day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But at the same time, I was scared. About telling Nii-san how I feel. I was scared that we couldn't go back to being close siblings like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So that's why you didn't write your name on the letter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder? Maybe I wanted you to chase me. Maybe I wanted to be found by the boy that I like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't say anything in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hey, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice sounded out, as calming as a gentle rain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">And what came out of her mouth was the exact same confession that Keiki had found in the love letter. Even the thick-headed Keiki would understand this. Mizuha liked Keiki, and not as her older brother, but as a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you're kind to me, when you spoil me, when you always give it your all. Even when you're clumsy. I like everything about you."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these sweet, oh so sweet feelings flowing out of her mouth, she continued to gaze directly at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the expression of a young maiden in love. As he was looked at with watery eyes, Keiki couldn't stand it anymore and averted his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Uwaaah… what is this…? This is really hard to reject, though…</p>
<p class="null-p">There was actually another goal for today besides concretely identifying Cinderella. In order to answer this young maiden's feelings, in order to reject her, he had brought her to this place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once he figured out Cinderella's identity, the answer was as clear as day for Keiki. Of course, he loved Mizuha, and he treasured her. However, that was only a love for a member of his family. Nothing more, nothing less. No matter how strong their feelings for each other might be, going out with his blood-related sister was ethically immoral. He couldn't look at her as a member of the opposite sex, and he couldn't develop any romantic feelings for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">-This was Keiki's decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really happy about Mizuha's feelings… But, after all… we are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was assaulted with a feeling of guilt, the words wouldn't come out of the prince's mouth. He didn't think that turning down a person could be this painful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Since we're siblings, it's wrong for us to be in love with each other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mizuha spoke aloud the feelings that Keiki felt, he could only nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, I think that it's wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">A younger sister having romantic feelings for her older brother wasn't something normal. Sure, in their childhood days, they had made stories up about marrying each other in the future. But sadly, back then they were not full-fledged high school students. He needed to turn her down so that she could experience normal love, with a normal boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………It's not wrong at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What called him back was a cold voice, deep like the ocean, and it sounded like it was close to tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san? We're siblings of the same age, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnn? Ah, yeah. You're right, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, the ribbon that Mizuha was wearing was a beige color. Just like Mao and Ayano, she was a second-year student. That was the reason that Yuika had called her "Mizuha-senpai." She was the same age as her older brother. But Keiki couldn't quite understand the reasoning for why she had brought that up so suddenly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When was your birthday again, Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The 11th of October."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I was born on the 3rd of March."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what's your point?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you think that it's weird? Even though we were born in the same year, there's only 5 months between our birth dates."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Isn't that just because our old man worked really hard?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even with hard work, it's still impossible. You paid attention in sex ed, right? You know that it takes about ten months of pregnancy until the baby is born."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He remembered hearing about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, that meant that, if they really were siblings of the same age, then there should be more than ten months between their birth dates, but it was only a mere five for Keiki and Mizuha. Until now, Keiki hadn't thought about that at all-</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh? But… wait… that means… huh? What does that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But now that he was, his heart was beating so fast that it started to hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And while Keiki was completely frozen in shock, Mizuha slowly drew closer. Maybe it was because of the pool, but she somehow had a different smell to her than usual. And, the girl slowly opened her mouth-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also have to apologize in advance, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he had even realized it, it was already too late. While the setting sun illuminated the stairway in a red hue, their lips overlapped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-, -.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt his heart almost leap out of his chest, and the blood rushed to his head. A girl's lips were unbelievably soft. Combining that with the abnormal situation of kissing his actual little sister, his head couldn't keep up. In this state, they had a long, long kiss. However, this one kiss completely broke their sibling relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">After their lips finally departed, Keiki could only stare blankly at Mizuha, who softly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not wrong at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a quiet voice, but it still reached Keiki's ears clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is not a single thing wrong with my feelings for Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe those words were directed at someone not present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cinderella's next words compeltely shattered the prince's reasoning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me and Nii-san aren't actually siblings."</p>
<p class="null-h2">To be continue...</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">* For those of you who haven't read the main story, please proceed with caution.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with this, the third volume of "Hensuki" is done.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though I thought of putting in another perverted ingredient this volume as , I remembered back when Keiki's Senpai was wearing his trunks, or when his head was stepped on by his Kouhai, or when he hit his classmate's butt with that hard thing, so I had plenty of perverted ingredients already.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the thing that gave me the most problems while writing the manuscript was that one scene with Yuika…</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyways, now that we are three volumes into the series, Keiki finally found out the identity of his 'Cinderella'. Through there were some ups and downs in volume 1 and 2, finally it's been revealed that 'she' is indeed Cinderella.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since I had decided to make 'her' the Cinderella from the very beginning, I wonder if there were any readers who had suspected 'her' to Cinderella from the very beginning. And finally being able to reveal it now is only thanks to the readers who have supported me all this way. Really, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">And even though Cinderella's identity has been revealed, the main story is still far from over. Though things will surely change from here on out, I would be very happy if you'd still continue to read this series.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the illustrations from sune-sensei were as marvelous as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing those cute and erotic illustrations really got my blood pumping, especially the color illustration of Mao's belly. It really looks like a pattable belly, don't you think? By the way, all the color illustrations were greatly to</p>
<p class="null-p">Editor-san's liking, too. It seems like even the people responsible for</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hensuki" are perverts. Just like you might suspect, the heroine on the cover will naturally be our Cinderella. My tension at max level, and I'm looking forward to seeing that wonderful drawing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it might be a bit off-topic, since the sales of "Hensuki" were so great, a serialization and a drama CD are currently in production. To think that we would achieve this at the same time. "Hensuki" will turn into a manga, and a drama CD. The serialization will take place in the monthly Dragon Age.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please keep an eye on the expanding Hensuki world.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, with that, I would like to bring this afterword to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">I sincerely hope that we will see each other again in the 4th volume.</p>
