<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">The first thing that pulled Keiki's consciousness back into the real world was his phone's alarm ringing from next to his pillow. While lying on his back on top of his bed, he grabbed his phone and turned the alarm off without even looking at the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's already morning, huh?" He muttered with a hoarse voice as he looked up at the ceiling. "…I couldn't get a wink of sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">All total, he probably hadn't even slept for an hour. His head hurt like he had a hangover, and his eyelids felt like lead. On top of being sleep-deprived, the February chilliness in the air made him unable to muster any motivation to leave his bed, so he just turned his back towards the air entering his room through the curtains.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the cold was one reason why he wanted to stay in bed today, but it wasn't the main reason. It was also the reason why he was unable to sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Subconsciously, Keiki found himself directing his gaze to his side-to the empty space on his bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the space his little sister Mizuha would often sneak into at night. They had slept together almost every day, especially recently, which was why that space had become a reserved sleeping spot. Keiki couldn't help but feel lonely upon waking up with that place empty and the girl nowhere to be seen. It felt like a hole had been torn open in his heart. Every time he tried to come to terms with it, a sharp pain stabbed his chest again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess I should get up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki pondered for a moment if he could just skip school, using his lack of sleep as an excuse, but his somewhat earnest and diligent personality weighed heavily against that decision. He gave up on the idea of falling asleep again and pushed himself upright. He put his smartphone into his pocket, opened the curtains, and left the room. He walked down the short hallway and trotted down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who let out a surprised voice was Keiki's co-habitant, who happened to open the door to the living room right as he came down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…" "Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was already wearing her uniform, with a coat on top. For a moment, her expression looked a bit clouded, but she immediately gave him her usual smile instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah… morning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tried his best to hide his uncomfortable feelings, and gave somewhat of an average greeting in response. However, that was all he could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't find any words to say after that, and his mouth closed. Since they lived in the same home, running into each other was normal. Keiki had been aware of this when he stepped out of his room, and had mentally prepared himself for this event, but it ended up still being too much for him. Whenever he found himself in front of her like this, he was reminded of the incident that had happened a day prior-the event that had occurred in the classroom in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their exchange back then was the main reason Keiki had spent a sleepless night. His chest tightened, and he became unable to look at Mizuha, which</p>
<p class="null-p">was why he averted his gaze. This led Mizuha's student bag to appear in his view. She seemed to notice this, and spoke up before Keiki could ask.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be going ahead today." "I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I already prepared breakfast for you." "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The lunch box is the same as always, too." "Got it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then see you later." "Alright…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha put on her shoes and stepped out of the entrance while Keiki watched. The door closed, and Keiki found himself alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess she really is avoiding me…" he muttered to himself.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_5.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Normally, Mizuha and Keiki left the house together. It happened especially often if neither of them had any particular business to take care of. Both of them had been on duty for cleaning at school the previous week, so there was no reason for her to rush out the door like that, and yet Mizuha was heading out like she was running low on time. Moreover, it almost seemed like she was indicating that she didn't want to walk to school together. This was the first time Keiki had felt Mizuha distance herself to such a degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's been acting weird, too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought back to that grim expression she had made for a split-second. Unlike Keiki, who often wore his heart on his sleeve, she didn't make much of an expression after that, but it looked to him like she was forcing herself to keep a straight face. Even someone as dense as Keiki could tell that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, he spent more time with her than with anybody else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I can understand why, at least…</p>
<p class="null-p">He took his smartphone out of his pocket. After searching for a bit, he found a single message. He had received it from Koharu last night. It read 'Was there any development with Mizuha-san after that?' She was asking about any progress Keiki was making in his pursuit of love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really can't tell her, can I…?" The reason he couldn't respond was because he simply felt guilty.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had gone through such lengths to support his love. Despite being busy with her entrance exams, she set up an entire plan for him to confess, and tagged along for the date at the amusement park. She had said kind and supportive words when he felt guilty about developing feelings for his step- sister. She had prayed for his confession to be a success, and now when he considered telling her the results of all her efforts, he couldn't bring himself to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha really did reject me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he put this reality into words, it felt like someone had stabbed a sharp knife right through his chest. In that classroom, despite feeling that the two of</p>
<p class="null-p">them shared feelings for each other, Keiki had been rejected, and any hopes of dating Mizuha had been stolen from him. The feeling of his first love being a failure had caused him to not get a single wink of sleep the entire night.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: Put On Your Bear Mask</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, when Mao arrived at school, she happened to run into her handsome good friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, Mao-chan." "Morning, Akiyama."</p>
<p class="null-p">Akiyama Shouma spotted Mao, and raised his hand to beckon her over. He had a flawless outer appearance that would make every girl fall for him, but he was a certified lolicon on the inside. Now he had a girlfriend who was actually older than him, but looked exactly like a loli. Ever since he got himself this small girlfriend, he'd been spending his days in enviable bliss. When Mao approached Shouma near the entrance, he tilted his head with a confused look in his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-chan, you seem a bit tired." "Yeah, the deadline's close…" "Oh, for another shoujo manga?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, for an actual doujinshi now. Another sale's coming up, but I'm still working on the manuscript… Want to hear the details?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuumm… I think I'll pass."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? There's even a scene with Keeki and Shouto making up passionately after a big fight, but I can't quite draw it how I'd like…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How do you even make up in a passionate way?" Yet again, Shouto-or rather Shouma-made a confused expression at that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since this was Mao he was talking to, he had a vague idea of what she might be on about, but he decided to leave this BL talk to the members of the calligraphy club. After making their way to the shoe lockers, Shouma took out his slippers. Mao spoke up again as she did the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Akiyama?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You guys went to the amusement park once, right? For a double date." "Yeah, we sure did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How was it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm… Koharu-chan was super excited by all the attractions, and she was totally adorable. Almost like a small child. It was great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You damn lolicon." Mao couldn't help but retort. As expected, Shouma was still a lolicon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not that. I was asking about Kiryuu and Mizuha." "Ah, them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since Mao had figured out the person Keiki had feelings for, she had been trying to work behind the scenes to give them a push together, which was why she had suggested the double date in the first place. She knew that this event had actually happened that Sunday, but she had no idea how things went, nor how their relationship had developed after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you interested in what the boy you like is up to?" "Something like that, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, haven't you gotten honest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decided to stop being stubborn about it. Not to mention the fact that you probably already knew."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you're pretty easy to read, Mao-chan." "And still Kiryuu had no idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">If anything, the fact that he didn't notice Mao's feelings for him after she made so many moves on him was practically rude at this point. She never could confess because she was too scared, so he could hardly be blamed either, but her maiden's heart still had hoped that he would realize it himself at one point. Mao found this part of his personality quite bothersome.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So did Kiryuu confess to Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, I think the whole amusement park date was a failure. He ended up getting motion sickness at the most critical juncture. I don't have a clue what happened after that, but… since they've always been rather frank with each other, I imagine that he's probably told her by now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, they were getting along really well during the date." "Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao could already picture that in her head. After all, those two siblings were a severe brocon and siscon. They'd always flirt around beyond what normal siblings would do, so this information wasn't exactly shocking to Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Kiryuu did confess, then they must be a happy-go-lucky couple by now." "They both have feelings for each other, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a known fact within the calligraphy club that Mizuha had feelings for her step-brother. When they went on the trip a while ago and got drunk from the alcoholic chocolate, she brazenly attacked her brother at night. Back then, Keiki rejected her advances, but things were different now. He now openly declared that he had feelings for his step-sister. Now that this was the case, it was only a matter of time until they started dating. And that would be the end of Mao's first love. "…Jeez."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she understood this when Keiki rejected her on Valentine's Day, it didn't make it any easier to swallow. She tried to suppress the gloomy feelings building inside of her as she put on her slippers and headed into the classroom with Shouma.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm? Isn't it a bit noisy over there?" "You're right. It seems like it's our classroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">A large number of students had gathered in front of the classroom for class 2B. There were even students Mao and Shouma hadn't seen before, and all of them were sneaking glances inside of the classroom. Mao recognized a familiar face in this crowd and approached them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Megumi, did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, Nanjou-chan… Akiyama-shi too…" Their classmate, Onizuka Megumi, turned around to face them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's all the ruckus about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I guess it'd be easier for you to just take a look than me trying to explain it." Megumi just pointed inside the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao and Shouma moved through the crowd, making their way closer to the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Big question marks appeared above their heads. Sitting in the center of their familiar classroom was a living creature that definitely did not belong there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A bear…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it wasn't an actual live bear. Instead, it was an individual who was wearing the head of a bear costume. Judging from the body beneath the head, it was a boy, and Mao felt like this head was oddly familiar.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Isn't that the one the club prez used during the culture festival?</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki had disguised herself with this costume during the culture festival last year. This bear head had to be from that costume. Naturally, the combination of bear head and normal uniform stood out quite a bit in an average environment like a classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… Kiryuu, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably… he's sitting on Keiki's seat after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging from the posture and situation, Mao and Shouma assumed that Kiryuu Keiki was the one wearing the bear head. However, that only led to an even bigger question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is that guy doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why would someone wear a bear head costume without it being a special occasion? Keiki would sometimes act like he didn't have a brain in his head, but this was taking it to a whole new level.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He was already sitting there when I got here. Nobody's even dared to approach him…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I don't blame them. That sight is pretty terrifying."</p>
<p class="null-p">The students already in the classroom were all keeping their distance from the bear, forming a circle around it, none of them attempting to get any closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao wholeheartedly agreed with their sentiment, and would rather not bother with this situation, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I imagine that it's Kiryuu-shi inside that mask, and I'm sure he has some kind of reason for wearing it, so I'd love it if his dear friend Nanjou-chan decided to try to figure out what's going on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not friends with any bears. Why not ask our dear man Akiyama for that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, now, Mao-chan. It won't bite, probably."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, yeah. Knock it out with your beauty, Nanjou-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want me to knock it out, aren't there people more qualified to punch it in the head?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, Mao was indeed curious why he was wearing a bear costume. With Megumi and Shouma egging her on, Mao let out another sigh and reluctantly made her way inside the classroom. All the gazes of her classmates focused on her, but she tried her best to ignore them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, what are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, Nanjou." The bear turned towards Mao and spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice sounded a bit muffled because of the head, but it was undoubtedly Keiki's. After confirming this, Mao moved on to the next question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you wearing that? Do you need help figuring out how to invite Mizuha out on a date again? I don't mind giving you some advice on the subject."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao asked Keiki quietly enough for their classmates not to be able to hear, but the bear didn't respond. Keiki just looked downwards, almost like he was ashamed. Of course, Mao had no way of knowing his expression underneath that head, but she could tell that something was wrong. Finally, Mao heard a faint mutter from the bear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…ted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What? I couldn't catch that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to Keiki whispering and the bear mask muffling it even further, Mao had trouble understanding what he had said. Seeing no other option, she moved closer to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I was rejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, she heard him clearly. However, what Keiki had said made Mao doubt her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I confessed to Mizuha, and got rejected…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To Mao's shock, first thing in the morning classroom, the person she had feelings for said that his own love life had ended in failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Mao's suggestion, she and Shouma led Keiki to a nearby classroom. Since they didn't have much time until homeroom started, Mao didn't waste any time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me get straight to the point. What do you mean Mizuha rejected you?" "Yeah, about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah wait, take off that bear head first. I can't hear you properly." "R-Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mao pointed it out, Keiki finally realized he was still wearing a bear head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did you even get that from?" Shouma asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was in the school's storage shed." Keiki answered, taking off the bear head.</p>
<p class="null-p">He put it on the desk next to him and started explaining the circumstances. "I actually confessed to Mizuha yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I could guess as much since you said that you got rejected." "Nanjou, are you angry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao's eyebrows were twitching in fury, giving away her spoiled mood, but there was no time to talk about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I actually planned on confessing at the end of the date, and the atmosphere was great between us, too, but I got motion sickness on the Ferris wheel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, I called her to an empty classroom after classes were over and asked her to go out with me… but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-chan said no?" "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The response to Keiki's confession had been 'no.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha gave me chocolate for Valentine's again this year… She even said that they were her honest feelings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Last week on the 14th of February, Mizuha gave Keiki chocolate after classes ended. Not to mention that it was homemade chocolate, with her feelings practically baked into it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really thought that Mizuha and I felt the same about each other…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki himself felt that the atmosphere between them had been progressing nicely as of late. After the Valentine's chocolate, they held hands home from school, he found a heart in his lunch box, and they even went on a double date. They took pictures during it, shoulder against shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without a doubt, the distance between them had continued to decrease. They even had promised to go on a date during the weekend, and Mizuha truly seemed delighted… and yet this was the result. How could Keiki not be depressed about something like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Odd…" Shouma finished hearing Keiki out, and put one hand on his jaw as he pondered the situation. "You've been so lovey-dovey as of late that it made even me embarrassed, so why would Mizuha-chan reject you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know, but she said that we can't go out because we're siblings."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki still vividly remembered exactly what she had said. Even if they weren't related by blood, they were still siblings, so they couldn't become lovers. That was Mizuha's reason for rejecting Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, it's not like I could just accept that, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much Keiki pressed the matter, Mizuha wouldn't explain it more than that, so he was forced to spend a sleepless night in his room. Why did he get rejected? Why would Mizuha be bothered by something like this so late into the game? Keiki didn't know the answer to these questions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I confessed with full confidence, but was so embarrassed from being rejected that I must have put on the bear head to try to hide from everyone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why you became a bear man…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just to let you know, wearing that thing is way more embarrassing, I think." Shouma seemed somewhat empathetic, but Mao couldn't help complaining. "She's still avoiding me… Maybe Mizuha hates me now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you kidding me?" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way Mizuha would hate you. In what world would a girl make lunch for a boy he hates, sneak into the bed of a boy she hates, and approach the boy she hates while naked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right…" Keiki felt an odd, oppressing pressure from the displeased Nanjou-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha did say that she had feelings for her older brother. After all, there was the whole Cinderella incident and the love letter she left for him. Keiki had no idea why she rejected him when he confessed. However, there was no doubt that she indeed felt something for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I know for sure that Mizuha still loves you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…" Keiki felt his chest growing hot from Mao's support. "Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki once again realized what great friends he had. They were supporting pillars during a time his heart was about to shatter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll try talking with Mizuha one more time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't accept things as they stood right now. He needed to find out exactly why Mizuha had rejected him like she did.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So? Why do you look like a dirty rag, Keiki-senpai?" Yuika gave Keiki a very dubious gaze as she sat next to him at the reception desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">She used her small finger to gently poke at her upperclassman's cheek as he slumped over the desk like a used rag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heeey, Keiki-senpai?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anybody home?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of certain circumstances, Keiki didn't even bother to respond. As a result, Yuika pouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure have some nerve to ignore Yuika." "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you continue this act any longer, Yuika will tickle your sides just for you,</p>
<p class="null-p">Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you plan on doing?" Keiki had an odd feeling of danger and raised himself upright.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked over at Yuika, she was wiggling her fingers in a grotesque way. Keiki felt a shiver run down his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what's wrong? You're obviously depressed about something, Senpai." "The thing is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He explained the circumstances in the same way he had with Mao that morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?! Keiki-senpai, Mizuha-senpai rejected you!?" "Woah, Yuika-chan, you're too loud!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry… Yuika was just so shocked." Yuika grew flustered and put one hand over her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">She glanced around at her surroundings and moved a bit closer towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But isn't that weird? Mizuha-senpai is always talking about how much she likes you, so why would she reject you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma said the same thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's how you ended up looking like a dirty rag." "No, that's not the main reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I couldn't accept it, so I tried to talk with Mizuha one more time. So I sent her a message, but this was her response…" Keiki explained and showed Yuika his phone screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuika saw what was there, she let out a shocked 'Woah'.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Do you have time during lunch break? I need to talk to you about something.'</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the message Keiki had sent upon returning to the classroom after Mao gave him advice. In response to that, his little sister responded:</p>
<p class="null-p">'Sorry, but please don't talk to me at school.'</p>
<p class="null-p">It was clear that Mizuha's affection for Keiki had taken a severe downturn. That was the kind of message you'd send to someone you don't even want to see. And yet, saying 'Sorry' at the beginning was proof of her kindness despite that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's definitely angry about something." "Right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty rough to ask that you don't talk to her at school. Did you do anything that would make Mizuha-senpai hate you, Keiki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think I did…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At least not anything he remembered for the past few days. If anything, Mizuha seemed to be happier than ever before, considering their plans for their date over the weekend and all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, knowing how dense you are, Senpai, you probably angered her without realizing it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dense…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since even someone kindhearted like Mizuha-senpai is acting like this, you must've done something pretty bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha wasn't the type of person who would get angry for no reason. Just as Yuika had said, there must be some special reason for it. But it still didn't help Keiki. Why would his little sister suddenly start avoiding him?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was following this train of thought, a possible explanation came to Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Do you have an idea what it might be?" "Maybe…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She might have found my secret 'Yuika-chan Collection' on my phone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your what now!?" Yuika was taken aback. "What is that supposed to be!? Yuika can't ignore that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I created a picture folder on my phone that has lots of different pictures of you. For example, in a bunny girl outfit, a maid uniform, pajamas, and so on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, yeah. You tend to take a lot of pictures, Keiki-senpai…" "It's because you're so cute. I can't help myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha!? …R-Really now…?" Yuika's expression did a complete 180, from staring at Keiki in contempt to blushing.</p>
<p class="null-p">She cleared her throat and got back to the previous topic of conversation. "S-So? What's this about a 'Yuika-chan Collection'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we were looking at the pictures we took during our date on Sunday, but I actually left my phone unlocked when I went to take a bath. It was a pretty long bath, so there's a chance that Mizuha might've seen my Yuika- chan Collection."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if she happened to see it, Yuika doubts that Mizuha-senpai would get this angry because of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha could be quite jealous if she wanted to. After all, she had felt jealous and pressured when seeing her beloved Onii-chan getting along with the girls from the calligraphy club, which caused her to attend school without wearing panties as some bizarre form of stress relief. If she found out that Keiki had kept a fair amount of pictures of another girl on his phone, there was a big chance she might erupt in anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you're right. If that collection really was what caused her behavior, then she would have called an emergency family meeting instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was hard to imagine that Mizuha's anger was instigated by the Yuika-chan Collection. Not to mention that Mizuha was still in a good mood on that Sunday. But if that wasn't the reason, then what was?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… So is this what Yuika thinks it is…?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Mizuha-senpai rejected you… That means that Yuika has a chance again, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bueh!? Y-Yuika-chan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu…" Yuika made a bewitching smirk as she put her hand on Keiki's lap. "You can switch to Yuika whenever you want, you know? The fact that you secretly kept these pictures is a bit worrying, but Yuika is also pretty happy about is, so she might just forgive you right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say what?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika gently whispered into Keiki's ears while rubbing his thigh, and a cold sweat ran down his back. Koga Yuika was a very cute yet assertive girl. Ever since she confessed to Keiki on that Christmas night, she had made his heart race many times. Of course, Keiki didn't dislike her assertiveness, and having</p>
<p class="null-p">a younger girl like him didn't feel bad at all, but he had already offered his heart to someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I haven't given up on Mizuha yet…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tsk, Yuika really thought I could get you with that…" Yuika clicked her tongue and pulled herself away from Keiki. "Yuika will hold herself back for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Phew." Freed from this troublesome stimulation, Keiki let out a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that was the moment he realized something felt off. "…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… for a second, it seemed like someone was watching us…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Several other students were present in the library. A boy was reading light novels in front of a bookshelf, a group of girls were seated at a desk looking at reference books, and a boy and a girl were talking near the entrance. It was hard to judge who was most suspicious, but Keiki had definitely felt an odd gaze just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe they were just jealous of you? After all, you get to be this close to a beauty like Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I feel like that's not it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The intensity of the gaze felt like something more than just simple jealousy. "Hmm. Did you say or do anything weird today, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not really? All I did was walk into the classroom while wearing a bear mask, and then everyone started acting all weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That definitely is something that would attract a lot of attention…" Yuika made an exhausted expression. "Maybe that's why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that really all it was?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's probably okay, then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tried to forget about that gaze he felt. However, contrary to the curiosity Yuika mentioned, it felt rather cold and distant… and unpleasant to Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">What should one do in order to fix a girl's mood? Girls are complicated living beings, so trying to understand them when they have a spoiled mood is unfathomably difficult. Normally, you would want to avoid them until they've calmed down, but sometimes that option isn't available.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I might have made Mizuha angry without knowing about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">After classes ended, Keiki pondered about how to fix Mizuha's mood, and eventually decided to go with some western sweets from a store in front of the train station. The contents of the small plastic box Keiki carried were the result of an entire afternoon classes' worth of thinking. It was, to put it simply, a weapon to defuse the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope Mizuha cheers up with this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Generally speaking, Mizuha was very forgiving and kind-hearted, but she probably had complaints she was keeping to herself when it came to her shared lifestyle with Keiki. That was where the cake he had bought came into play. After some thorough research, he decided to buy Mizuha's favorite cake, a Mont Blanc, from this sweets store. The plan was simple: To improve Mizuha's mood with this cake.</p>
<p class="null-p">He even bought some cheesecake for himself, so an invitation to eat together would be a great conversation starter.</p>
<p class="null-p">If everything works out, I'll ask her to go out with me one more time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Determination burned inside Keiki's chest. However, he stopped in his tracks the moment afterwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ah, is that Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the opposite side of the street, he spotted his younger sister walking on the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is she doing here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she was still wearing her uniform, she must be on the way home, but it was rare to see her shopping for dinner like this. Not to mention that the local supermarket was closer to their home, so if she didn't have any business near the train station, she wouldn't be around here….</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hesitated for a moment, then crossed the nearest pedestrian crossing and started tailing Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Where is she going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With her student bag on her shoulder, Mizuha wasn't exactly rushing anywhere. She was just calmly walking down the street. However, since she never hesitated, she must have some location in mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, why am I hiding from her?" Keiki wondered to himself as he hid in the shadow of a telephone pole.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he was curious, he could just ask her directly. She had only said to not talk to her at school, and there was nobody around to interrupt them, either, yet he couldn't take that single step because he was terrified of being rejected again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki turned around towards the voice that called out to him, he was greeted by a beautiful sight. She was wearing a coat on top of her uniform,</p>
<p class="null-p">her long and glossy black hair flowing out- "Sayuki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing here?" "Ah, well, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not sure how to explain himself, Keiki's gaze naturally drifted towards Mizuha. He immediately realized that this was a mistake, but it was already too late. Sayuki had already guessed what was going on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stalking your little sister is quite an extreme interest to pick up, Keiki-kun." "That's not what this is, okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you really look like a stalker right now, you know." "Urk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't argue against Sayuki's logic. Watching a high school girl from the shadows of a telephone pole would be something that would earn him the right to be reported.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh right, Senpai. Congratulations on getting accepted to a university." "Oh my. Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I bet getting accepted to your university of choice must have been easy when you're so talented and clever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed, it was even simpler than putting on my underwear with one hand- So anyway, why are you stalking Mizuha-san right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it didn't work…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki attempted to change the topic, but failed. Also, and it's not like it mattered, but putting on your underwear with one hand sounded like it would be quite difficult.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll lose sight of Mizuha at this rate, so can we talk while we follow her." "Fine by me. It makes me feel like I'm some kind of detective."</p>
<p class="null-p">With his new comrade, Keiki continued to follow Mizuha in the shadows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, this is quite the surprise. I'm out buying ink, and I find out that Keiki- kun has turned into a stalker."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, there are reasons for this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he didn't want to be regarded as a stalker until the end of time, Keiki explained the gist of what was going on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What? Mizuha-san rejected you?" "Indeed, and pretty harshly." "Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, that means you're still free, and there would be no problem if I go on the offensive now, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you arrive at that conclusion…? Also, why are you opening up your blouse!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was thinking of trying to seduce you." "Right here?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was joking. I wouldn't start stripping in broad daylight like this, you know. I can't be thrown out of university because of public indecency."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you say, but I still remember that you didn't wear panties on that date that one time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki undoubtedly was a hardcore masochist and a pervert. She</p>
<p class="null-p">was the kind of person who wouldn't hesitate to flash her breasts in public.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I bought a cake to help us make up. I saw her on my way home, and thought that it was weird for her to go home this way, which was why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You decided to stalk her."</p>
<p class="null-p">The way she phrased it stung, but he couldn't disagree either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this really is a surprise. I would have never imagined Mizuha-san would reject your confession, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You think so too, Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you do anything that could make her hate you? Did you peek at her in the bath, sniff her used panties, or something of the sort?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a pervert, and Mizuha wouldn't be angry if I peeked at her in the bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Mizuha was an exhibitionist, she would probably be quite happy if Keiki did that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just thinking that maybe she got tired of you for always being such a dense siscon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would like to think that's not what it is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She might have come here to meet another man or something." "…Wha?" Keiki froze in his tracks. "What did you just say?" "Maybe Mizuha found someone else she likes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha has someone else she likes? What's up with that? Unbelievable. "No no no, that can't be… You've watched too many dramas, Senpai.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha of all people wouldn't…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You never know. The world is filled with good men who are more handsome than you, have better future prospects, and aren't half as dense as you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that would explain why Mizuha had suddenly rejected Keiki's confession. The shock of the fact that her feelings for her brother might have decreased since a long time ago was strong enough to make Keiki's legs shake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"People change, and so do their hearts. Of course, my love for you won't disappear that easily, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you trying to gain bonus points now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the way I see things, you should probably give up on Mizuha-san and choose the Sayuki route. What do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not stopping!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki moved closer towards Keiki, grabbing his arm like she was a spoiled cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know it might sound weird coming from me, but I'm really beautiful, I have big breasts, and I'm quite clever with a promising future. You definitely won't regret choosing me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh crap, she's not letting up at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the type of person she was. Always pushy, always honest with her own feelings… At this moment, Keiki felt quite jealous of this strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy about your feelings, but I don't plan on giving up on Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tsk. I knew you'd say that, but it still hurts to hear it directly." Sayuki pouted and moved away.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what if Sayuki-senpai is right?</p>
<p class="null-p">What if Mizuha fell in love with someone else, and is now on her way to meet him?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to believe it, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything had worked out fine with Mizuha in the past few days. They sat on the living room sofa, shoulder to shoulder, looking through the pictures from their date. Keiki couldn't believe that the smile Mizuha showed back then was fake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah!? Where's Mizuha!? I lost her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problems there. I just saw Mizuha walk into that store." "Which store?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike the clumsy Keiki who lost his target, Sayuki had kept a keen eye, and pointed at a single-floor establishment. From the looks of it, it was a simple cafe you could find anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe she's meeting someone there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd love to find out, but walking inside there would make it easy for us to get found out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's check the situation from the window."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now they were acting like true detectives. Keiki would have preferred some time to cool his head, but reality never waits. Going home wasn't an option either this late into the game. Thus, the two of them hid in the corner of the window, confirming the situation inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, this place is pretty fancy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like this cafe is pretty popular with girls from our school, so they visit it a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, really…… Hm?" "Keiki-kun? What's wrong?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't answer Sayuki's question. What he saw inside the cafe was something he could never have imagined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are Mizuha and Rintarou together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had taken off her coat, and was seated at the same table as the male student Mitani Rin. They sat facing each other, with beverages in their hands, talking together, smiling together, laughing together…</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">From an outsider's perspective, they looked like a couple in the prime of their youth. When Keiki saw this, he subconsciously formed a fist. Judging from their behavior, this didn't look like a coincidental encounter. They had most likely planned to meet up here. Though Keiki didn't know why they had decided to do so…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, um… Keiki-kun? As I told you earlier, there's no way that Mizuha-san would run off and have a secret rendezvous with another man. This is a stylish establishment, so I imagine Mitani-kun had trouble going in there alone, so she agreed to go with him. Maybe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki's considerate words didn't reach Keiki's ears. Everything in front of him turned blank, and he found himself unable to think about anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sayuki-senpai, feel free to take this." "Eh? …Wait, Keiki-kun!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki shoved the cake he had bought into Sayuki's arms. All she could do was watch him run off. He just continued to run along the asphalt, almost as if he wanted to escape this location, or this reality, as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why is she avoiding me but meeting up with Rintarou?</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want to watch Mizuha gleefully chatting with another boy. You could call it greed, or a desire to monopolize. Jealousy? That too. In the end, Keiki wanted the girl he liked to only have eyes for him. This of course wasn't an emotion you would have towards your little sister, but rather a symbol of romantic affection towards Kiryuu Mizuha, the girl he could now only see as a member of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess I really do like Mizuha…</p>
<p class="null-p">This hot feeling burned in his chest. If this feeling wasn't love, then what was it?</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, Keiki had changed into some more comfortable clothes, and was now standing in front of Mizuha's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Maybe giving away the cake was a bad idea after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of the cake box, he was holding two cups filled with hot chocolate. It hurt that he couldn't give her the cake that he had originally planned on, but using what he had at his disposal at home should be enough to start a conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Let's go."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki took a deep breath and knocked on the door. After that, he received a calm 'Yes' in replay, and the door opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made some hot chocolate, so I thought maybe we could drink it together."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was in her pajamas when she opened the door, and her gaze dropped down to the cups. The reason he had already made it before asking was simply so that she couldn't reject him. Since Mizuha had stayed in her room the entire time after finishing dinner and taking her bath, this was probably the only chance to make her open up in any way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's some things I want to talk to you about, too, Mizuha." "…Alright. Come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki got his permission, and he entered the room. Mizuha often hung out in her older brother's room, but Keiki barely visited her in her own room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike Keiki's 'typical boy's room', Mizuha's room was girly and arranged in an adorable way. It even smelled like Mizuha. Now that Keiki had become conscious of Mizuha as a member of the opposite sex, even coming in here made his heart race.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can have a seat on a floor cushion." "Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki put the tray down on the low table and sat down on the cushion. Mizuha sat down across from him, and they both reached for their cups.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're welcome." Keiki answered, and took a sip from the hot chocolate.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was still a bit hot, and Mizuha was blowing on it so as to not burn her tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Be careful, okay?" "Yup, will do." "Also, well…" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um…"</p>
<p class="null-p">There were a lot of things Keiki wanted to ask. Like the reason his confession had been rejected, why she didn't want to talk to him at school, and why she met up with Rintarou after school… However, he chose what he believed to be the most important topic to bring up right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, did I bother you or anything?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you've been avoiding me all day, so I didn't know if I'd hurt you or made you angry or anything… I was thinking that maybe that was why you had rejected me too, so… If there's anything I did wrong, could you tell me so I can apologize?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…" Mizuha's eyes grew a bit wet.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put down the cup and raised her head. "…That's not what it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The one who has to apologize is me." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought I had feelings for you, but I was actually mistaken."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What?" Keiki doubted his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's response was completely outside of Keiki's expectations, and it felt like his whole world had shattered into pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because we were always together, I probably just misunderstood my feelings. If you think about it, there's no way family members could fall in love with each other."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha… What are you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying that the feelings I have for you are not love." "Wha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being told this to his face, Keiki blanked out. He had assumed that Mizuha had rejected his confession because of certain circumstances. That she didn't come to hate him, but had a different reason to say no. However, this small glimmer of hope was crushed by what Mizuha said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But then… what should I…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had just awakened to his own feelings. How should he face his feelings for the girl in front of him from now on?</p>
<p class="null-p">"We just have to go back, Nii-san." The girl explained with a cold and distant voice. "Go back to being normal siblings."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: Will you be able to love your little sister as long as she's a cutie?</p>
<p class="null-p">Thursday's lunch break arrived, the day after Keiki had spoken to Mizuha in her room. After finishing his lunch, Keiki flopped his upper body onto the desk like his soul had left his body. This time, he had gotten rejected by Mizuha for good, and yet his lunch tasted as great as ever, full of affection, which was why he still had trouble accepting what the girl had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why'd she suddenly talk about us going back to being normal siblings?" He muttered in a voice too quiet for anybody to pick up.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much he thought about it, that response was too surreal to be true. Unbeknownst to our struggling protagonist, a group of people were watching over him and his agony.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-shi is even more depressed today. Do you know what happened, Akiyama-shi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is just between us, but he said that he confessed to Mizuha-chan and got rejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what the hell!? What kind of development is that?! Why haven't you told me earlier about this!?" Since Megumi loved any form of love talk, she immediately pressured Shouma for more juicy details.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring the two of them, Mao talked to Keiki directly. "Kiryuu, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was thankful for Mao's sympathy and concern, but he didn't feel like talking to anyone right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry… I'll go grab something to drink." Keiki stood up from his seat and staggered out of the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had planned to get some fresh air for a bit of a change of pace. However, immediately upon leaving the classroom, he regretted this decision. On the way to the vending machine, he saw Mizuha and Rin talking with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…She's with Rintarou again."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was probably the one sight he'd rather have not seen right about now. The two of them seemed to be deep into a conversation, and despite having disliked him quite a bit only a few weeks ago, Mizuha was clearly enjoying the conversation right now. This change in attitude pointed to a change in their relationship and distance between them, and it made Keiki burn with jealousy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I really want to get in their way, but Mizuha said we should go back to normal siblings, so…</p>
<p class="null-p">From his standpoint as an older brother, objecting to his little sister's human relationships was definitely too meddlesome. He used this as an excuse to force the jealousy inside of him to die down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, he just walked away from there, leaving the two of them to their own business.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Keiki's mood stayed gloomy even after classes ended, and since he couldn't even find the motivation to head home after finishing his day duty, he instead made his way to the clubroom building. He went up the stairs to the second floor and opened the door at the far corner. Upon entering inside, he found Mao reading a book.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work on your day duty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup." Keiki gave her a brief greeting and put down his bag, sitting down on the chair facing Mao. "Are you the only one here today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika mentioned she had something minor going on. What about Mizuha?" "I don't know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She didn't tell you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't ask. We've only talked the bare minimum ever since yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their conversations only included the absolute minimum communication necessary, and nothing beyond that. Almost like they were in a constant business meeting. Reminded of that, Keiki was forced to let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kiryuu?" "Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You talked with Mizuha, right?" "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did she say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That her feelings for me weren't real, and that we should go back to being normal siblings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see." Mao muttered a moment later.</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed like she had something to say, but stopped herself before she said it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what are you going to do now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What can I do? My feelings ended up being one-sided, and I can't change Mizuha's feelings in a single day…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At least she hadn't started hating him or anything. As it was, he could still</p>
<p class="null-p">work hard to try to make her fall in love with him. However, since she was saying that she misunderstood her own feelings, there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you fine with that, Kiryuu?" "I mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you going to just give up on Mizuha?" "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With Mao's gaze directly glued to him, Keiki was at a loss for words. Unable to bear it, he awkwardly averted his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…There's nothing I can do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that so?" Mao muttered and stood up from her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki raised his head, wondering what she was about to do, watching her as she approached him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're saying that, then I won't hold back anymore." "…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right when Keiki was thinking that these words sounded oddly like a declaration of war, the girl suddenly sat down in Keiki's lap, clinging to him with her arms around his neck like they were lovers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou-san, what are you doing!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think? Trying to seduce you." "Seduce me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you already. I haven't given up on you yet, Kiryuu. If you don't plan</p>
<p class="null-p">on going out with Mizuha, then date me instead." "Wha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was suddenly confessed to. Keiki knew that Mao of all people wasn't the kind of person to joke about her feelings. That was why he was unable to respond, or push away the girl's hand on his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nanjou…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao blushed ever so slightly and brought her face closer to Keiki's. At this close of a distance, he could clearly see her long eyelashes. She gently closed her eyes, and was about to press her lips onto Keiki's-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry." Keiki grabbed her shoulders and gently pushed her away. "Sorry, Nanjou…" Keiki felt the urge to apologize as he looked the girl directly in the eyes. "I still love Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yep, I know." Mao nodded, and smiled gently.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was almost like she had known the answer from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The person I like isn't a wuss who'd give up after being rejected once. You might be clumsy, but you always think of other people first… That stupid and kind guy is the Kiryuu I like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nanjou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So protect Mizuha for me." "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Protect her?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second. What do you mean…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki failed to grasp why Mao had said that, and tried to ask for clarification.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, a loud sound interrupted their conversation. The two of them looked towards the source of the noise and found an open door with a student bag dropped to the floor. A single female student stood there, staring at them in disbelief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…" "Mizuha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had let down his guard. His blood froze when confronted by the arrival of the one person he hadn't expected to meet here. The girl must have been similarly shocked to witness this scene, as she didn't even try to pick up her bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you two doing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well, this is…" Keiki tried his best to come up with an excuse, but it was a futile effort.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao was still sitting on his lap, with his hands on her shoulders. No matter how you looked at it, this wasn't a normal situation for friends to be in. This looked more like a couple flirting around, with them being mere moments from sharing a kiss… Basically, being seen like this was something that Keiki would have wanted to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… sorry. I didn't think you two were going at it like that." "No no no no, you weren't interrupting anything, okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, I don't need to hear your excuses." Mizuha smiled gently and picked up her student bag. "I'll be taking my leave, so you can have as much fun as you want." She waved her hand at the two of them, and briskly walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, chase after her!" "Y-Yeah…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao jumped off Keiki's lap and pushed him out of the room. He spotted Mizuha running down the hallway and hurried to try to catch up with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is going on…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did things turn out like this? Why was nothing working out for him? All he did was fall in love with a girl, and all he wanted was to be with her. Even though there should have been so many new interesting things for him to discover at this point in life, his love was rejected, and everything turned into a confusing mess. However, in this very moment, he simply didn't want Mizuha to have the wrong idea about what she had seen. That was plenty enough of a reason for him to try to catch her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't let her get away…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He decided to think about all the problems that could arise if he didn't, and forced himself to run down the hallway as fast as he could. After running down the stairs and through the passageway, he finally caught up with his target as she ran inside the classroom building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to keep Mizuha from escaping any further, he grabbed the girl's arm and forced her to a stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, listen to me! You've got the wrong idea!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wrong idea about what?" The girl answered without even turning around. "I'm not angry or anything, you know. It's none of your little sister's business who you go around kissing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you phrase it like that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She sounded as calm and practical as ever. Even though she had no idea how Keiki felt at that moment when he asked Mao for advice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, that's all I wanted to say." "Wait, I'm not done yet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha attempted to escape again, and Keiki pulled on her arm even more forcefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!? No!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The anger overwhelmed Keiki, and he pulled on her arm firmly enough to turn the girl around, only to immediately regret this decision seconds later after he saw her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why… are you crying…?" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, Mizuha was crying. Tears of sadness, but also anger, ran down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were the one who said we should go back to being normal siblings, so why are you making that kind of face now…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was the one who rejected Keiki's confession. And she even said that she never felt anything like love for him. So why was she crying now?</p>
<p class="null-p">It's almost like… she's jealous…</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Keiki thought their feelings were mutual, he had been rejected. Then Mizuha told him that her feelings were wrong the entire time, and yet here she was once again, having a misunderstanding about his relationship with Mao, bursting out in tears. Her words and actions didn't make any sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">I really don't get it, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, he couldn't leave the crying girl alone. At the very least, he wanted</p>
<p class="null-p">her to stop crying. "Mizuha-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Mm!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he even realized what he was doing, he had already pressed his lips onto hers. He put his hands on her slender shoulders, crouching down ever so slightly to make up for the height difference between them, and stole her lips. Keiki didn't know why he did such a thing. Even though he should be angry with her, he found himself unable to blame the girl when she made such a face, and only came up with the decision to kiss her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">A brief moment passed, and after the two of them separated from each other,</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha raised her head in a daze… "Mizuha…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Why am I…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet again, tears were born from her eyes, falling down… "!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mizuha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha wiped away her tears and ran away again. This time, she ran clearly because of what Keiki had just done. When he realized this, he found himself unable to chase after her. He simply ran his fingers through his hair in frustration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What am I doing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he didn't want her to cry, his actions caused her to shed tears yet again. So many things were going on that his head wasn't functioning</p>
<p class="null-p">properly anymore. In the end, he yet again couldn't talk things out with Mizuha. He had hurt the girl he cared for. What else could he do?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? What's going on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Filled with regret and frustration about his own inability to make up with her, Keiki raised his head as he heard voices around him. Several female students had been watching him from another classroom down the hallway. Since classes had just ended, it made sense that a few students would still be around, and they had noticed the ruckus Keiki and Mizuha were causing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Did you see that just now? He kissed her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I totally did. Maybe that rumor was true after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">…rumor?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are they talking about?" Keiki was confused, but their conversation didn't sound like anything good would come of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kei-kunsenpai…" "Eh? …Rintarou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he turned around, he saw Mitani Rin standing there, wearing his male uniform. Normally he was the impersonation of energy, but now he making a grim face at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just cruel, Kei-kunsenpai… Deceiving me this entire time…" "Huh? Deceiving you? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't play dumb! I saw you kissing Mizuha-senpai just now!" "So you saw it too, I guess…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not just that. There's already a rumor going around that Kei-kunsenpai and Mizuha-senpai are dating, despite the fact that you're siblings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now it made sense. The fact that this rumor existed explained Mizuha's odd behaviour, as well as the odd stares he felt at the library room. It only clicked for Keiki when it was already too late, and he made everything worse with that kiss. With the worst possible timing, someone else's voice reached Keiki's ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-It's weird, right? Siblings dating."</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon returning to the clubroom, Keiki explained what happened after he left. About the fact that he chased after Mizuha, kissed her, the whispers from the female students, and the rumor going around school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you knew about the rumor, Nanjou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well yeah, the girls in our class were talking about it here and there." Mao, who was sitting on the same seat as before, nodded calmly.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why she told Keiki to protect Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then again, I only heard about it today, and since you were so depressed from being rejected, I don't blame you for not catching on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what stories are going around right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm…That you two were sharing a passionate hug at the amusement park?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So they saw that, too, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason these rumors started going around was a group of second-years who happened to see Keiki embracing his little sister at the amusement park. In reality, this was all to hide Mizuha's panties from being visible to the public, but bystanders who didn't know about these circumstances would probably think they looked like a lovey-dovey couple. That's what caused the rumor that Kiryuu Keiki was dating his little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was wondering why I was feeling some weird gazes. So that's what it was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you like her, hugging her in public like that was probably going too far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There were extenuating circumstances that led to the whole thing, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If not for that hug, the situation below Mizuha's skirt would have been revealed to the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I bet Mizuha knows about the rumor. That's probably why she rejected your confession."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But why is Mizuha getting so close to Rintarou then?" "You rang?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A sudden voice interrupted their conversation, and when Keiki turned towards it, he saw Rintarou taking off his shoes and walking onto the tatami mats. Rin had been wearing his male uniform most of the time as of late.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou? Were you listening?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sure was! The entire time! Didn't I come here with you, Senpai?" Young Mitani complained with a pout on his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">He embraced his knees with a melancholic attitude as they talked about the ongoing Kiryuu siblings scandal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you're here, that makes things a lot easier. You were talking with Mizuha in that cafe near the train station the other day, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was, but… how do you know about that, Kei-kun-senpai?" "I just happened to see you there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided not to reveal the fact that he had simply been stalking them. "So, why did you two meet there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-senpai invited me. She asked if we should have some tea at a cafe." "Did she not say anything else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… Something about getting along with me and how it was beneficial to her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's what it was…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki looked over at Mao, she seemed to agree with his line of thought. She nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically, Mizuha was using you, Mitani." "Eh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She wanted everyone to think that she was close with a boy besides Kiryuu, to get rid of that rumor that they were going out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Mizuha-senpai was playing with my purity?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a pretty cruel way of putting it, but essentially yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way!? I really thought Mizuha-senpai had finally accepted my feelings…" Rintarou grew pale, unable to deal with the shock. "…Huh? Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure Mizuha-senpai asked me to help get rid of that rumor…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"See? She actually didn't even deceive you." "You just weren't listening to her, Mitani."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I was so happy about being able to drink tea with Mizuha-senpai, and I was so focused on her breasts that I wasn't listening at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu, this guy's actually the worst." "I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that confirmed that Mizuha was aware of the rumor that was going around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, Kei-kun-senpai, you're so cruel." "Me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was wondering why you were always getting in my way, and it was because you were dating Mizuha-senpai! Not to mention that you're not related by blood, so it's perfectly legal! I bet you're fondling her breasts every single night! I'm so jealous!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No I'm not, and we're not going out, either." "Eh, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I did confess to her." "So you did! I declare guilty!" "Guilty, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you're pretty much a criminal the instant you fall in love with your little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even Nanjou agrees…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them were in sync.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Personally speaking, it's not funny at all, and I want you to explode in eternal pain, but as step-siblings, you are technically allowed to get married. If the laws allow it, I won't get in your way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you say, but you never had any chance with Mizuha, Rintarou. Acting closer than you really are is just troublesome, so could you just not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should you really be saying that to my face!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rintarou was the type of person who never understood if you didn't tell him directly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you completely messed up by kissing Mizuha-senpai there." "I do regret that, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Instead of helping that rumor subside, you added more fuel to the fire."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Mao said, Keiki had only made the rumors worse. The story about the kiss would undoubtedly spread like wildfire.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I know the circumstances, I can support you, but I think it'll be difficult for everyone to accept your relationship."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki remembered what he had overheard the students say earlier. They were probably spreading this rumor all over the place right about now, without even knowing how Mizuha and Keiki's love came into existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that's why Mizuha said we should go back to being siblings…</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew about the rumors, and had distanced herself from her older brother in order to protect him.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should I do about this?</p>
<p class="null-p">If he wanted to honor Mizuha's decision, there was only one choice for him to make. He had to stand down and keep his distance from her until the rumors died down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Can we really go back to being normal siblings now?</p>
<p class="null-p">Could they revert their relationship back to how it was before they became conscious of each other? Back to being average siblings who enjoyed each other's company?</p>
<p class="null-p">…Of course not.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was that easy, then Keiki wouldn't be suffering like this. He had become aware of her as a girl, and not simply a member of his family. His attraction to his gentle step-sister was too deep to be undone so easily. He never had any option of giving up on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be difficult, but I love Mizuha, so I'll try my best to make sure we can date publically."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's about what I expected. I mean, look at those honkers." "This was never about her breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuck, Kiryuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you blaming me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, Keiki had started to make progress.</p>
<p class="null-p">I need to talk with Mizuha when I get home.</p>
<p class="null-p">For starters, Keiki had to confirm how he thought Mizuha felt. What came after that he had no control over, so there was no use worrying about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">It was past 5pm, and Mizuha sat in a nearby park, still wearing her uniform. The setting sun was dazzling as Mizuha rested on the bench that her and her older brother often sat on to eat ice cream. Countless regrets filled her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did I say that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that it didn't have anything to do with him or her was just a cruel choice of words. She was shaken by the fact that Keiki and Mao had suddenly gotten closer right when she distanced herself from him, and had gotten emotional.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I started crying just because I saw him hugging Mao-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since this was her older brother she was talking about, Mizuha figured it was just another accident, but that didn't mean she could suppress her feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure that Nii-san must have realized it by now…" Realized the fact that she still had feelings for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's probably why he kissed me…" She subconsciously touched her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was shocked to be kissed like that, and couldn't hold back her tears. There was no way people didn't see them, considering they did that in a public place. Even though she was terrified of being seen at that moment, her heart wouldn't stop racing with excitement at the same time. She was a mess. She had decided to keep her distance from Keiki, but she couldn't hide her affection in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I do…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha broke down before she could do anything about the rumor. She got angry all on her own, and started crying. She probably had caused trouble for Keiki yet again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I say when I see Nii-san again…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was used to hiding her feelings. She had hidden her love for her older brother ever since they were small children. But she didn't have the confidence to stay calm after what had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to go home…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing a coat, but it would soon start getting chilly outside. Mizuha's best bet would be to head home as soon as possible if she wanted to avoid catching a cold, but that would mean she'd run into Keiki. Being able to live together with the person she loved was wonderful, but at times like these it also had its fair share of drawbacks. She needed some more time to think about all of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?" When a cute voice called out to her, Mizuha raised her head. "Ah…" Standing there was-</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha still hasn't come home…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After parting ways with Mao and the others, Keiki arrived home as the sun was setting and coloring the streets orange, but the door was still locked. He took out the key from his bag and opened the door. The entryway was dark. He took off his shoes, made his way directly to the living room, and turned on the lights.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's getting dark outside. Where is she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no sign that Mizuha had returned before Keiki. Normally, Keiki would just assume she was taking a detour shopping at the nearby supermarket, but after what had happened today, that was unlikely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I should probably contact her…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki tossed his bag aside and took his smartphone out of his pants pocket. Right at that moment, he received a phone call. He was hoping for it to be from his little sister, but the name on the screen didn't say 'Mizuha'. Instead, it read 'Koharu-senpai.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why her? Keiki wondered to himself and pressed the accept button. "Hello?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ah, Kiryuu-kun? It's Koharu.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'I happened to run into Mizuha-san at the park.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Mizuha was at the park?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'There seemed to be something going on, so I invited her over. I was thinking of letting her stay over for the day.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have heard something from Mizuha. After what happened, it should be hard for Mizuha to see Keiki right now. So Koharu must have guessed that and offered a helping hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I talk with Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Um… I'm sorry, it seems like she doesn't want to talk right now.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki expected as much, but as long as she was safe, Keiki wasn't hurt too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then could you tell her to call me once she's calmed down? I'll be waiting all night."</p>
<p class="null-p">'I understand. I'll let her know.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry to cause you trouble like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">'This is no big deal at all. Just leave Mizuha-san to me.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much. Please do." Keiki gave his thanks and ended the call.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least Mizuha wasn't in danger. Now that he knew that Mizuha was in safe hands, Keiki could talk with her later. Since his little sister wouldn't be home, Keiki now realized another problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll make omurice tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, nobody was there to cook for him. Keiki took off his coat and made his way to the kitchen he oddly enough rarely visited. It was time to</p>
<p class="null-p">challenge his non-existent cooking skills.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">A little bit before Keiki began his cooking attempt, Koharu had just finished her call, and she now looked towards Mizuha as they both sat in Koharu's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I contacted Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much." Mizuha said from her seat on a floor cushion.</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew that her older brother would be worried if she didn't at least contact him in some way, but she felt hesitant to call him herself, which was why she had requested Koharu's aid. Koharu put her phone down on the table and gave Mizuha a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. This is the first time I've picked up a girl like this." "Same here. This is the first time I've been picked up by a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu just happened to pass by the park where she spotted Mizuha. After hearing her out about her current circumstances, and hearing how complicated it must be to go home right now, she invited Mizuha to her house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you hungry, Mizuha-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. I don't really have any appetite right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's take a bath first. I don't have any clothes your size, so I'll be preparing some roomwear for visitors."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am eternally grateful…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Does she get that many visitors? The world of the rich was still unimaginable for Mizuha. And she once again realized this after taking off her clothes in the changing room and stepping into the Ootori family's bath. It was about twice as big as the one at her house. Since it was just Koharu and her, it</p>
<p class="null-p">almost felt too big. Not to mention that Koharu had been waiting for Mizuha with a sponge in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be washing Mizuha-san today." "Wha? You don't have to go that far…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no need to be shy. You're a guest here, Mizuha-san." "Alright…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was worried that she would seem rude if she turned Koharu down too much, so she reluctantly agreed. While Koharu washed her, Mizuha felt oddly nostalgic, thinking back to the days when her mother would wash her body. After they both cleaned themselves fully, they sat in the bathtub, facing each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, this feels great…" "I'm glad to hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-senpai, your skin is so beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I might not have as great of a body as everyone else, but I at least won't lose when it comes to my infinite youth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. Your skin is so smooth and clean."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not too far behind either, Mizuha-san. Your calm and collected attitude really makes you seem very mature."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder…" Mizuha didn't think that she was mature. "I'm still a child."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though her body was adultlike in some aspects, her heart was nowhere near mature. She was terrified to think that someone was talking badly about her and her older brother. If she were a bit stronger of a girl, she might have been able to hold her head high with the two of them sharing mutual feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san confessed to me." Mizuha spoke softly while dropping her gaze</p>
<p class="null-p">downwards towards the water. "But I rejected him. I said that we couldn't go out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you say that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a rumor going around at school… That we're dating despite being siblings, and that it's gross…" Mizuha told Koharu the words she happened to overhear by chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">All those happy feelings inside of her had cooled down immediately upon hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I absolutely hated the idea that Nii-san might suffer because of me, which is why I kept my distance from him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki told Mizuha the words she had always wanted to hear, and as long as she had agreed to his confession, they finally could have started dating. And yet, Mizuha herself had denied herself that possibility.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even today, I said something horrible to Nii-san… Because I thought he finally started hating me after I rejected him…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's chest tightened again just from remembering it. More tears appeared from her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha raised her head, only to see Koharu wiping away her tears. "I don't think Kiryuu-kun is angry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He really loves you. As proof of that, he told me to relay a message."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He'll be waiting all night, so you can call him once you've calmed down." "Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's not fair. If he phrased it that way, there was no way Mizuha couldn't contact him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sheesh, he's so stubborn at times."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he didn't have the guts to come peek at her when she was taking a bath, there were times when he was like a real man. Mizuha found herself wanting to hear his voice this moment, and the instant she became aware of that, she subconsciously started pouting. Koharu watched this cute action with a warm smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Around midnight, Keiki's smartphone vibrated. Keiki jumped up from his bed and pressed the accept button as he sat on the sheets. He put the phone to his ear, and finally heard the voice of the girl he had been longing to hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">'…Hello? Nii-san?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for calling me, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">'How can I not call you when you say you're waiting?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh, I knew that'd work."</p>
<p class="null-p">'That means I can hang up now, right?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now now, don't rush things. Can't you listen just a bit longer? I've been waiting all this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">'Sure…' The voice on the other end of the call sounded stiff.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was still acting wary of Keiki. Realizing this, Keiki decided against</p>
<p class="null-p">getting to the main topic, and instead brought up something random. "You're at Koharu-senpai's place right now, correct?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Yup, I'm standing on the veranda right now.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, outside? Aren't you cold?" 'Senpai lent me a cardigan.' "Ahh, alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">'What about you, Nii-san? Did you eat a proper dinner?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I tried making omurice. But it wasn't nearly as good as the ones you make, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">'I'd actually love to try it.'</p>
<p class="null-p">When they talked about food, the girl's voice grew a bit more gentle. Keiki could tell that Mizuha was starting to relax a bit more. Now should probably be fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard from Rintarou today. You knew about the rumor of me going around at school, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'……'</p>
<p class="null-p">"And because of that, you said that we can't date, since we're siblings." '…That's right.'</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably realized that hiding it was impossible at this point, so she confessed that was the reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Even if I did, what would change?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">'It's true that we're siblings, right?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not wrong, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Keiki wanted her to rely on him. It was probably just his pride. 'I figured that you would just suffer if I was with you.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care what anybody else says, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">'Even if you don't, I sure do. I don't want people pointing at you because of me.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">'I'm sorry, Nii-san…'</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, you're not the one who's at fault."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had zero intentions of blaming Mizuha for anything. If anything, Keiki was the one who embraced her at the amusement park, and held hands with her on the way home.</p>
<p class="null-p">'So I decided to take the day off school tomorrow. Senpai said I could stay over for a while as well… But I'll be back starting next week.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">That is probably the best choice right now. The whole kiss incident would probably start blowing up at school starting tomorrow. Until they both cleared up their own feelings, keeping a safe distance was probably the safest bet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's just one thing I want to ask." 'What is it?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, you didn't suddenly start hating me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'…No.' The girl on the other side of the call said. 'In fact, I was really happy to hear your confession, Nii-san. I was happy to hear you liked me. Those were words I had always wanted to hear.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice sounded delighted. Even though they were so far apart, Keiki felt like he could see the girl's beautiful smile in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">'But I still think we should go back to being normal siblings. Even if we start dating in this situation, both of us will end up getting hurt, and neither of us will be happy.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's the end of it. With that thought, Keiki closed his mouth. Since it was already so late at night, that was probably as long as they would be able to talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Then I'll see you soon?'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Keep yourself warm, okay?" 'You too, Nii-san.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha gave a brief 'Good night', and ended the call. Keiki gazed at his phone for a few more moments and pondered what Mizuha had said at the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go back to being normal siblings, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now Keiki understood what Mizuha was going through. Even Keiki wasn't dense enough to not understand the heavy meaning behind the rumors and how they made Mizuha feel afraid of dating publicly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that we share the same feelings, but what should I do about this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The scope of the problem was too large. Keiki didn't know where to even start. Even so, thanks to this single phone call, Keiki felt much more relieved. It was all he needed to sleep somewhat peacefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">During lunch break the next day, Keiki sat alone in the calligraphy room, stuffing his cheeks with sweet bread. He wasn't good enough of a cook to make a lunch box for himself, so he had to make do with the food from the convenience store on the way to school. While eating the sweet bread, Keiki mentally organized the information he had gathered from his conversation with Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's always the option of us dating in secret, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They could act like normal siblings at school and date when they were behind closed doors. However, that would basically equate to them accepting that their relationship was wrong, and Mizuha probably wouldn't accept that either. Since it came down to it-</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like we need to do something about those rumors."</p>
<p class="null-p">The question was… how? Although they weren't related by blood, they were generally seen as siblings. With that title looming over them, they couldn't use the same media they had relied on for the student council election.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How can I make everyone accept us…?" "Sounds complicated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? …Ah, Fujimoto-san?" "Hello there, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki hadn't even noticed Fujimoto Ayano had walked up behind him. One eye of hers was hidden by her bangs, as usual. She raised one hand with a friendly "Hey."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, how long have you been there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ever since you started talking about being unable to go back to normal siblings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So from the very beginning…" Keiki felt embarrassed knowing that Ayano heard all of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seemed to be lost in thought, so I would have felt bad interrupting you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for your kindness… So what brings you here, Fujimoto-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to see how you were doing. The rumor about you is going around quite a bit, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">So even she had heard of the rumor. Thanks to the kiss throwing fuel on the fire, there was no way the student council president wouldn't have heard about it. The reason Keiki wasn't eating in his classroom was simply to avoid endless questions from his male classmates.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard about it from Mitani-kun. That you fell in love with Kiryuu-san's breasts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't fall in love with Mizuha's breasts, okay?" "But you like her breasts, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, of course I do, but… Wait, what kind of question is that?!" What was Keiki being forced to confess to anyway?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, are you trying to get between us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all, but… I just wanted to hear what you were planning on doing. I imagine that getting everyone else to accept your relationship will be difficult."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I'm trying to figure out right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Mizuha were brother and sister. Just when he thought that they had managed to bridge that gap between them, another obstacle had appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I considered dating in secret, but I really want to flirt around with Mizuha in the open. Instead of hiding everything, I want to brag openly about how cute my girlfriend is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to do something about those rumors …"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that the rumors have spread this far, it was going to be pretty much impossible to make them go away in a hurry. And there was an even bigger problem than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha said that she wanted to go back to being siblings. If I do something unnecessary, it'll be like trampling all over her feelings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had basically said that she wanted to keep some distance between the two of them. She didn't want Keiki to be treated maliciously, which was why she wanted to go back to how things were before their confessions. What Keiki was thinking of doing was going to completely go against this decision that she had made.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you can be a bit more selfish, Kiryuu-kun." "Selfish in what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like how you told me during the election, Kiryuu-kun." "Ahh, right…"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">When Ayano and Megumi were fighting for the position of the student council president, Keiki said something similar to Ayano when she tried to carry all the weight on her own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love is war, so nothing will work out if you only think of the other person." "That sounds oddly convincing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I actually had my heart broken not too long ago." "Really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And despite that, she was here to care for Keiki. What a truly wonderful person Ayano was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's important to be considerate of the other person, but I think you should choose to do whatever you believe in, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever I believe in…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That basically meant to prioritize his own feelings over other people's. If Mizuha disagreed with Keiki, then he just had to convince her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That might not be half bad, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, things were at a standstill right now. Keiki had the option of ignoring Mizuha's wish, troubling her in the process, but still believing in his own feelings and their correctness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujimoto-san, can I ask you to do something for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course." Ayano nodded with a smile to her former temporary student council member. "In return, I'd like one pair of used Kiryuu-kun underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I shall take it into consideration."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally Keiki wouldn't be fully on board with such stipulations, but in this situation he had to take every bit of help he could get. He was about to make the entire student body his enemy in order to be with the girl he loved. A pair</p>
<p class="null-p">of underwear in return for the help of the overpowered student council president was a small price to pay.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning of the new week arrived, and Mizuha was wearing a coat over her uniform, taking a different route to school than usual. However, her feet felt unbearably heavy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I really don't want to go to school…</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was melancholic about the prospect of going to the school that was probably filled with weird rumors about herself and her older brother. That being said, she already had taken one day off school. If she skipped classes any more, she would probably cause trouble for her parents, so that wasn't an option. With that determination in mind, Mizuha had made her way out of the Ootori Residence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she had left quite early, by the time she made it to the school gate, it was absolutely swarming with students, and she could feel their gazes gathering on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying to escape them, she rushed to the school gate and through that. At the front entrance, she changed into her slippers and headed to her classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">But just as she walked up the stairs into the otherwise empty hallway… "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the landing between the stairs, Mizuha couldn't move forward any more when she spotted a familiar group of faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's those girls again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a large girl with long hair and another girl with short hair and pierced ears. They were Keiki's classmates from class 2B, and they were talking about the rumor concerning him and Mizuha the day he confessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are they talking about us again…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's chest tightened as she remembered what had happened last week. They had called the idea of siblings dating gross, talking badly behind them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Hey, did you hear? There's some new information about Kiryuu and his little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sure did! I never thought they were fiancees who were accepted by their parents!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing the words exchanged by the two girls, Mizuha let out a dumbfounded voice. As expected, they were talking about Keiki and Mizuha, but the contents of said conversation were absolutely not what she had expected. While Mizuha froze in shock, their conversation continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The little sister actually didn't have any relatives, so she was was adopted by Kiryuu's family, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup! Then the little sister confessed to him, and Kiryuu slowly got attracted to her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They even convinced their parents to let them start dating! That's almost like a story out of a drama! I thought Kiryuu was a plain and boring guy, but he has guts when he puts his mind to it, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh? Wha? Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This flood of information made Mizuha's head spin. There were some familiar parts to the story, but other parts of it were things that she heard for the first time, which left Mizuha baffled. The number one word she could not ignore…</p>
<p class="null-p">Fiancee? Are they talking… about that kind of fiancee?</p>
<p class="null-p">A fiancee was supposed to be someone of the opposite sex who shared a promise to get married. And these girls were referring to Keiki and Mizuha as fiancees. Mizuha was completely and utterly lost. The part about them being accepted by their parents or something along those lines didn't even register with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is going on…?</p>
<p class="null-p">The first rumor had been about Mizuha and Keiki dating. Now it had progressed even further, and it was about them being engaged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And we went around talking about them without knowing the circumstances…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right… I kinda feel bad now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though they had been so excited not a few seconds ago, now the tension between them had calmed down. It appeared as if they were reflecting on their actions, or were even feeling guilty about it. However, more importantly</p>
<p class="null-p">-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what are you two talking about!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Wait, isn't that the rumored little sister!?" "Wait, she's here!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Mizuha even realized what she was doing, she ran up the stairs and closed in on the two girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me more about what you said just now!" Mizuha almost frantically pleaded for details.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, the long-haired girl hesitated a bit, but eventually explained.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We don't know the details ourselves, but last week on Friday, they released an extra school newspaper article."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, right. It was an article on the student council's website… Wait, why</p>
<p class="null-p">don't you know about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A newspaper article from the student council…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared that someone else was spreading different information this time. Of course, there was only one person who would benefit from this. Mizuha took out her smartphone and sent a message to Keiki, asking 'Where are you right now?'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after sending the message, Mizuha's gaze was glued to the screen. Oddly enough, the two girls next to her joined in as well. Finally, a response came.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she saw the response, Mizuha ran up the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was waiting in front of the fence on the rooftop of the classroom building when Mizuha came storming through the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that was fast."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Mizuha was still carrying her coat and her student bag, she had probably rushed here before even going to her classroom. She dropped all of it on the ground and approached Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's this about us being fiancees?" "Ah, so you've already heard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Some girls from your class were talking about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I thought it would take a bit longer, but I guess rumors do spread</p>
<p class="null-p">faster than I thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you were the one who started this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had expected as much when the message came in, but it appeared as if her older brother was indeed the mastermind behind this. When she realized this, Mizuha grew a bit agitated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you spread the lie about us being engaged?" "It's not a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I talked to Mom and Dad and got official permission for the marriage." "You asked them…? You told them about us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Of course I only told them what I could, but I explained our feelings and the rumor going around at school. They were both surprised, but they agreed fairly quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They did…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, their condition was that we had to become proper members of society first. But Dad said that he'd rather his own son take his adorable daughter instead of giving her away to some run-of-the-mill good-for-nothing guy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That sounds like something he would say." Mizuha was well aware of her parents' personalities and how odd they could be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that our parents gave us their permission, nobody can complain anymore. I'm sure that the rumors will change for the better soon enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you also come up with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If siblings dating is a bad idea, then you just have to overwrite the problematic part. If I made us not siblings but fiancees, then living under the</p>
<p class="null-p">same roof is no problem, right?" "That… is true, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was centered on a forbidden love between siblings. If there was any ethical problem with that, the only solution was to change their relationship entirely. That was why Keiki had spread the news that Kiryuu Mizuha was Kiryuu Keiki's fiancee. With that decided, all that was left was to act. He contacted their parents to get permission, and with the help of several people, contacted the newspaper club to write that article, telling them that Mizuha was simply his step-sister, that she was adopted, and that she had confessed to him. And finally that Keiki eventually came to fall in love with her as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In order to change the rumor for the better, I had to ask for the help of the student council, the people at the newspaper club, and a lot more. It would have been impossible if I had been working alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">The game had been set afoot, and all that was left to do was to wait. Although there were no classes over the weekend, people still came to school for clubs, so the news spread naturally. The new rumor had already started circulating on Saturday. Even Rintarou helped out by being the middleman with the newspaper club, despite sharing tears of frustration concerning his failed love for Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">The atmosphere inside the school changed shortly afterwards, the students blessing their relationship instead of shunning them. They were yet again a topic on everyone's minds, but not in the negative sense like before. That was what Mizuha herself had felt already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I apologize for doing this in secret. I thought that you wouldn't go out with me if I didn't do this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But becoming engaged? That's just crazy." "Probably."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, there was certain merit to doing so. After all, nobody would obstruct</p>
<p class="null-p">their love anymore. This was a fitting conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, the obstacles are all gone, so as long as you give your okay now, you'll be my wife in the near future…" Keiki tried his best to hide his tension, and faced Mizuha like he did during his first confession. "Please go out with me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shocking even their makers up in heaven, Mizuha's answer was another no. Not to mention that she averted her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, Mizuha-san? Isn't this the part where you should say 'yes' instead? Are you angry because I decided all of this without your consent, by any chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really, but…" "But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's marriage, you know. We'll always be together. Is it really fine to decide something important this nonchalantly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that?" "That…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I decided to confess, I made up my mind to spend the rest of my life with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………" Mizuha's eyes opened wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki wasn't just saying things without thinking about it. Shouma previously asked Keiki about his thoughts on marriage, and Keiki had said yes. He was determined to take responsibility for making his little sister his lover.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you actually don't have a choice anymore, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not letting you forget. You stole my first kiss at the pool, remember?" "A-Ahh… That might have happened?" Mizuha awkwardly averted her gaze. The guilt of stealing her older brother's first kiss would not vanish that easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I always admired love. I wanted to fall in love with a girl, start dating her, and share a kiss I would never forget for the rest of my life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Okay…?" Mizuha wasn't quite sure where this conversation was heading.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You stole my precious first kiss, the one I had planned to offer to the lover I was destined to be with. And I'll have you take responsibility for that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the first time Mizuha had confessed her feelings for her older brother. For a moment, Mizuha spaced out, but… eventually, a faint laugh escaped her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I'll have to take responsibility for that." "So then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah." Mizuha nodded, her cheeks glowing red. "I was really happy. About what you did for me, and how hard you worked for me. I felt like crying out of pure joy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have been holding back all this time, because she seemed close to breaking out in tears as she said this. She approached Keiki, took his hand, and raised her head with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mutual love is such a wonderful thing."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: No-Panties Girl Does not Look At Her Brother's Face</p>
<p class="null-p">Morning starts early for Kiryuu Mizuha. She would get up way before her older brother, change into her uniform with an apron on top, and make her way to the kitchen. This was her time to prepare both breakfast and lunchboxes for the two of them. She always enjoyed cooking, and making food for the person she loved made everything much sweeter and enjoyable. A boundless feeling of happiness filled Mizuha just from imagining Keiki eating her cooking with bliss and enjoyment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yesterday wasn't a dream, right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While making the rolled omelette, Mizuha reminisced about yesterday's events. Right now, Kiryuu Mizuha was her older brother's fiancee, even accepted by their parents. They are a couple, dating with prospects of marriage. Basically, she would one day become his wife-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be Nii-san's wife…" Just thinking about it made Mizuha grin uncontrollably. "…Ah, this isn't good. This isn't the time to be spacing out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha focused on her cooking, putting the food and side dishes into the lunch boxes. She waited for the food to get cold before putting on the lid. As for breakfast, she made scrambled eggs and sausages along with some tomato and lettuce salad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I need to hurry and wake him up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because both of the Kiryuu family's parents were absent most of the time, Mizuha took up the role of Keiki's mother at times. Waking up Keiki so he wouldn't be late for school was an important part of her duties. She took off</p>
<p class="null-p">her apron and left the living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">She headed up the stairs to the second floor and stopped for a moment in front of Keiki's room to fix her hair. Since she had always been conscious of him as a member of the opposite sex, she always wanted him to think that she was cute, so she took great care of herself when he was around. Then again, a dense prince like him would never understand the efforts that Cinderella went through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright." Mizuha knocked on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">No response came after Mizuha waited for a brief moment, so she opened the door herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me~ ……Ah, he's still asleep." She had figured as much when there was no answer to her knock, and as expected, her older brother was still sleeping safe and sound. "Fufu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person she loved was lying supine on the bed, breathing softly. Waking him up while he was sleeping like a child seemed like a crime to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, now that her parents had given Mizuha the responsibility of caring for him, she couldn't allow him to be late. She slowly approached her sleeping brother and gently shook his shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, it's morning. Wake up." "…Mmm… Five more hours…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like that's asking for a bit too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">At least ask for five minutes instead. Mizuha couldn't grant this request, so she shook his shoulders a bit more fiercely this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on. You'll be late if you don't get up soon." "Mmm… Mizuhaaaa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Kya!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened in an instant. Keiki's hand suddenly reached for Mizuha's arm and pulled her into the bed. Not to mention that he passionately embraced Mizuha in the process.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nii-san…?" "…Mm… Nnn…" "He's still sleeping…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like he had been moving in his sleep. But that made little difference.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is using me as a hugging pillow…"</p>
<p class="null-p">These two siblings had always been fairly close, so they had hugged each other many times. However, this was the first time since they had started dating. Mizuha's heart raced painfully fast from being hugged by the person she loved and from feeling his warmth. They really should be getting up soon, and this would make Mizuha's uniform wrinkly, yet she couldn't bring herself to push her older brother away, even though she knew that the more time they took here, the more they would have to hurry later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…We'll really be late, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So she said, but not a single cell in her body was intent on actually waking up her brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright, just five more minutes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha decided to be gracious this morning. Or so she told herself, but in reality kept enjoying this happiness to the point where they almost ended up being late.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">Classes went by in a flash that day, and Keiki found himself in the calligraphy clubroom. Keiki was sitting on a random chair, his eyes glued to his smartphone, when the door opened. Yuika walked inside the room with a</p>
<p class="null-p">grossed out 'Woah…' voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika has never seen such an indecent smile on your face, Keiki-senpai…" "Eh? Was I making that kind of face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about you look at yourself in the mirror? I can't even look at it." "It was that bad?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what were you grinning about, Senpai?" Yuika walked behind Keiki, taking a peek at his phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shown on the screen was the Kiryuu Household's living room sofa, with Mizuha and Keiki taking a selfie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, we took this yesterday to celebrate the start of our relationship." "It's been one day, and you're already a lovey-dovey couple…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was a simple picture taken at home, it was also Keiki's first picture since getting his first girlfriend. That fact alone was enough to make Keiki grin with joy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just explode already…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so happy, I actually don't mind exploding once."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika didn't need to hear your bragging…" Yuika looked at Keiki in disgust. "Getting a girlfriend and flirting around like that… Not too long ago, you were happy taking embarrassing pictures of Yuika…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you not make it sound like I was taking illicit pictures of you without your consent? If you said that in court, my life would be over."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had already received titles like 'Great Siscon Demon Lord' 'The accursed who has chosen the path of a siscon', and so forth, but if Yuika</p>
<p class="null-p">added 'Perverted Cameraman' to that, Keiki might actually get strung up by the boys at this school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But thanks a lot." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You gave me advice earlier, so I wanted to thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki was afraid of confessing to Mizuha, she was the one who gave him that push.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika didn't do anything special." "Even so, you really helped me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, Yuika is glad everything worked out for you." Yuika must have gotten flustered, since she averted her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her gestures really resembled small animals, which made her even more adorable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly speaking, it's not fun at all." "Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokihara Sayuki-san barged in right at this sensitive moment. She completely ignored the mood of the room, which earned her a harsh complaint from Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did you crawl out from, Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just opened the door like a normal human being, okay? More importantly, I heard it all, Keiki-kun. You started dating Mizuha-san with the premise of marriage in mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That you heard correctly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rejecting your first love and flirting with another girl, huh? You really are a</p>
<p class="null-p">cruel boy, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Witch-senpai was Keiki-senpai's first love!? What is that about!?" "Ahh, look what you did…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time Sayuki entered the stage, things always turned complicated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my. You didn't know? There was a time when Keiki-kun held passionate feelings of love towards me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah, Sayuki-senpai!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Even if you say that, Keiki-senpai told Yuika that he was close to falling in love with her! He was utterly entranced by Yuika's approaches."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even Yuika-chan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sparks flew between the girls who had once fought for Keiki's affection. Could there be any place even more uncomfortable than here, right this moment?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly speaking, I think you should take responsibility for stealing our hearts, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Responsibility…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. How about we decide on days where we share Keiki-kun between us? You can be Mizuha-san's boyfriend on Monday, and my master on Tuesday. That sort of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you even talking about?" "Are you stupid, Witch-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Yuika both made their own share of complaints, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can make it so you can have him as your slave on Wednesday, Koga- san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds wonderful! Let's go with that!" "Yuika-chan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika was seduced by the devil's whisper not a moment later. All of the girls in the calligraphy club were far too honest with their desires.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So now that that's decided, Keiki-kun will be my master today." "Ah, that's not fair, Witch-senpai! Make Yuika's turn on Tuesday!" "Hey now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki found himself in a problematic situation as both Sayuki and Yuika clung to him from each side, so he immediately voiced his own opinion on the subject.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I already belong to Mizuha, so there won't be any sharing!" "Keiki-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he made that announcement, both girls grew silent. Finally, Sayuki let go of Keiki's arm with a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. I'll accept the fact that you are Mizuha-san's boyfriend." "I don't think you have any other choice, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I won't let anybody else take my position as your pet!" "Nobody wants that, and there's no open position for that, anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">This person might actually be done for. At the same time, Yuika also let go of Keiki's arm, with a more saddened expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really like Mizuha-senpai, huh? Even though you used to search through Yuika's underwear before… What a shame…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did that come from!?" "Because Yuika is angry." "That's just too cruel!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was clearly just venting her anger at Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph. You rejected a cute girl, so you'd better be happy that this is all you have to pay for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so you confessed to him too, Koga-san?" "That means you did too, Witch-senpai?" "We both got rejected, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika utterly despises being put in the same category as Witch-senpai." Yuika's expression was distorted with displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sheesh, how many girls do you plan on making cry before you're satisfied, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can say that again. He's a playboy even though he has such a harmless face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really not a playboy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, Mao also confessed to him, so he really couldn't argue much. He probably would never be as popular as he was right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what made you attracted to Mizuha-san in the first place, Keiki-kun? I get that she's alluring enough thanks to her looks and household skills, but that's not the only reason, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Yuika is curious about that, too!" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation suddenly started going in an odd direction, and both of the girls closed in on Keiki once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell us, Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you fall in love with Mizuha-senpai?" "Do I really have to tell you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes." "Ehhhhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was backed into a corner. The two girls crossed their arms in front of him, and an average boy like Keiki had no hope of rebelling against them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Also, Yuika is curious as to what made you become conscious of her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So many requests… Well, it's a bit embarrassing to explain, but the reason I started to fall in love with Mizuha was the confession. After finding out that we weren't related by blood, I just started to be more conscious of her… and when I saw her talking with Rintarou, I realized that I was jealous, which caused me to notice my feelings…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waaah, that's actually pretty sweet!" Yuika commented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed, just listening makes me feel embarrassed." Sayuki agreed. "I'm gonna stop if you make fun of me, alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're listening~"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika and Sayuki backed off. Sometimes, Keiki felt like those two were actually pretty close.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So then… After constantly being attacked by Mizuha, knowing that she's loved me this entire time… how could I not end up attracted to her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She would cook him delicious food every day, prepare chocolate for Valentine's every year, stay at his side when he was lonely, and cheer him up. He felt happy because of all of the love coming his way, and eventually reached the same feelings as Mizuha had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Now I understand how you got so attached to Mizuha-san." "Yuika is jealous that Keiki-senpai loves her so much!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? After hearing such a sweet confession, I'm quite curious about how the person in question feels."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Hold on, where are you two looking…?" Keiki looked away from the two grinning girls and looked behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing by the door were Mao with her hand up and Mizuha with her student bag in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Mizuha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hello…" Keiki's little sister slash girlfriend was fidgeting awkwardly. Not to mention that her face was as red as a tomato.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um… did you hear that just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… well, yeah…" Mizuha nodded with a troubled smile. "I'm used to Nii- san sounding like a siscon, but hearing all of that was a bit more embarrassing than I expected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please just kill me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could only tell the other girls about it because the person in question wasn't present. Now that he knew that Mizuha had heard all of it, he was too embarrassed to go on living.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I'm also happy to hear that you feel this way, Nii-san." "Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like kissing you right now." "In front of everyone!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That crossed the line of being embarrassing and reached the territory of being publicly shamed. Keiki ended up declining the kiss right away, but he couldn't avoid being teased by the rest of the calligraphy club.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit before hearing her older brother's embarrassing confession in the clubroom, Mizuha had just finished her cleaning duty and stepped out of the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Phew." While walking down the hallway, she let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">The talk about Keiki and Mizuha being engaged and dating has spread across the entire school, so Mizuha was exhausted from being constantly questioned by her classmates.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone loves talking about love, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">And Mizuha didn't hate it either. This was the first time she had been asked so much about her older brother, and it was pretty embarrassing. It didn't feel bad by any means, but Mizuha needed to get used to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I never got a chance to really gush about my feelings, after all…</p>
<p class="null-p">Up until not too long ago, she had to hide the feelings for her older brother, and even after she was found out to be Cinderella, she really only talked about all of this with Mao.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-chan must know that Nii-san and I are dating…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The rumor had been spreading quite a bit, and since Mao was in Keiki's class, she probably had heard everything from him already. With this in mind, Mizuha passed by the restroom, only to run into a girl leaving at that exact moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Mizuha stopped in her tracks and let out an awkward voice was because she met the person she had just been thinking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…" "Mao-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao and Mizuha always got along quite well. They were in the same year, part of the same club. And unfortunately-they had feelings for the same boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you heading to the clubroom as well, Mizuha?" "Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's go together." "Sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">They lined up next to each other and started walking. However, no more words were exchanged after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I figured this would be how it would be, but I guess we really can't go back to normal…</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason for this awkward atmosphere was as clear as day. Mizuha had started dating Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Earlier, we all said that we wouldn't have any ill feelings towards whoever won, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't that simple of a thing to just get over. When a friend of yours starts dating the person you like, that incident is big enough to shatter a friendship between girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Listen, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah… what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because of that rumor going around, I figured as much but… you're going out with Kiryuu, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That guy worked really hard. He had the student council and the newspaper club help out. They even created that entire article about it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Knowing him, he must have gone above and beyond as always. He was always the kind of person who'd work hard even if it meant ignoring his own needs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I saw that, I realized just how much he treasures you, Mizuha. I learned that I really couldn't get between the two of you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mao-chan…" Mizuha stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mao turned around and continued talking with a beautiful smile. "That's why I decided to support the two of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!" These kind words put Mizuha on the verge of tearing up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her chest burned hot, and all the anxiety and fear of having lost a friend was blown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, Mao-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I haven't given up entirely, so if you show any openings, I'll be taking Kiryuu for real."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I'll make sure that it doesn't go that far."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha once again made up her mind to treasure this boyfriend she had so that she won't ever lose someone important to her ever again.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, Keiki had just finished his bath, and was now lounging in the living room, when Mizuha joined him after she finished hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, do you have any plans for later?" "Nah, I finished my homework, so I'll just chill."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, how about we watch a movie together? I rented some that looked promising."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, great idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was around 8pm in the evening. It was clearly too early to head to sleep. They put in the DVD, prepared some sweets and juice, and sat down on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they sat there in silence. They were a bit closer compared to before they started dating. With oddly comfortable feelings, Keiki pressed the play button on the remote. As the trailers for the upcoming movies were playing, Keiki spoke up to Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, how is school? Have the rumors died down?" "Nobody's judging us anymore, at least."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad to hear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the girls from my class often ask me what you're like and all." "It's hard being famous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have become like a celebrity couple at school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rintarou was all like 'What good deeds have you done in your previous life to have these breasts all for yourself?' and that sort of thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds like Mitani-kun." Mizuha let out a snicker. "But I feel a bit guilty about Mitani-kun. I pretty much used him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. He was above the clouds just having been invited out to tea." It was a give & take, so the end justifies the means.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to feel guilty at all, Mizuha." "If you say so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even worrying about a pervert like Rintarou was very much like Mizuha. While Keiki was thinking about that, Mizuha suddenly put her hand on his.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? About what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We couldn't go on the date…" "Ahhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the night of their double date at the amusement park, they promised to go on another date with just the two of them the following weekend. However, because of the rumor going around, they clearly weren't in a favorable situation for doing so. Of course, Keiki had been looking forward to it himself, but nobody could be blamed for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lot happened, so it can't be helped." "But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, I got to have you as my girlfriend, and we're having a sort-of date at home right now anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although watching a movie at home doesn't feel too different compared to before they started dating, just the fact that the distance between them had closed some made Mizuha happy enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not to mention that we can always go on another date soon." "Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They promised to always be together. Just like he as an older brother promised to always be with his little sister. Now he had promised to be with her as her boyfriend. There would be countless more chances for them to go on another date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah, you're right." A smile returned on his girlfriend's face, making Keiki feel relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time they focused back on the TV, the real movie had started, so they enjoyed it to the fullest while holding hands the entire time.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day after they watched the movie, Keiki and Mizuha walked to school together happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll see you after school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, later." Mizuha waved her hand at Keiki and walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though this was the same as always, possibly because they had spent more time together after they started dating, when it came to actually parting, Mizuha felt more and more lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How greedy am I…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She pondered visiting her older brother in the classroom during lunch time. Or would that be too bothersome for him? These thoughts went back and forth in her mind as she made her way towards the shoe lockers when someone tapped on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yaho, Kiryuu-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Takasaki-senpai. Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who called out to Mizuha with a friendly tone was the former student council president Takasaki Shiho. She was as much of a beauty as ever, and her wavy hair was gorgeous today. Although she never talked with Mizuha much, they had become acquainted when Keiki worked as a temporary student council member.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I keep seeing you together with Keiki-kun. Aren't you lovey-dovey?" "We only came to school together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I feel like heart marks came out of your hand when you waved at your older brother just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sounds like something that would happen in a manga." "Ahahaha, that's just what it looked like, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">What a cheerful person she was. Although their tone sounded different, the atmosphere she gave off resembled Sayuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you're right. There might have been heart marks coming out." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm way too happy being able to date Nii-san after all." "Hmmm? You really like Keiki-kun, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Takasaki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, the girl's voice had an oddly sad tone to it… "You should probably be careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun has a lot of female friends, so there's no guarantee he won't ever set his eyes on another girl, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I doubt that'll happen, knowing Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"People's feelings change, right? From what I've heard, Keiki-kun's first love was Tokihara-san, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had heard about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nii-san even thought that he still liked Tokihara-senpai…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was always kind to other people, but he had an especially soft spot for Sayuki. He even cleaned the clubroom for her when it was just the two of them. Even the big cleaning operation that caused the Cinderella incident was because the teacher instructed Sayuki to clean it, and Keiki got everyone together to help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that Keiki-kun is the devoted type of person, but it wouldn't hurt to be careful, right? You should know that Keiki-kun is pretty popular."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew this as well. Mizuha's step-brother was quite popular with girls, not to mention that all of them were exceptionally cute. There was Tokihara Sayuki, Koga Yuika, the endless tsundere Nanjou Mao… And all of them harbored special feelings for Keiki, so the odds weren't zero.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I think that Keiki-kun is pretty nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho dropped a bomb like it was nothing special. It had enough impact to completely throw Mizuha off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, just think of it as advice from a Senpai, and keep it in mind… Anyway, bye bye~" She said what she wanted to say and walked off.</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, she had battle power completely different from Sayuki. "I doubt Nii-san would cheat on me, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had trust in her older brother, she really did. However… "It's true that he's popular with girls…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He would surely devote himself solely to Mizuha. This hope was inside of her, but after listening to what Shiho said, she grew anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Looking into it won't hurt anybody, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a necessary investigation as Keiki's future wife-or so Mizuha made up excuses and secretly made up her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">That day during lunch break, Keiki walked down the hallway in order to buy some drinks, when he ran into Mitani Rin on the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kei-kun-senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Rintarou… Wait, it's Rinko right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Rin was wearing a skirt now, he looked more like a beautiful girl than a guy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels like it's been a while since I've seen you wearing that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been holding back on crossdressing, after all. I wanted Mizuha-senpai</p>
<p class="null-p">to see me acting as manly as possible… But I was rejected despite all my efforts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because you were only looking at her breasts, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It must be nice being able to do whatever you want to those badonkas, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know what you're thinking, but I definitely am not." Keiki wasn't from the planet of breasts like a certain someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, since we ran into each other, why don't we talk a bit, Senpai?" Rinko said and clung to Keiki's arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Rinko, what are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm angry that you stole Mizuha-senpai from me, so I'll be playing a little prank on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of prank?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't this basically like you're cheating? You have a girlfriend, yet you're on a rendezvous with another girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get away from me immediately!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't just as simple as a honey trap. Since Rin looked exactly like a girl, if someone who didn't know his real gender knew about this, people would accuse Keiki of cheating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, let go already!" "Don't wanna~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it, how are you this strong!?" "I am a boy after all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a hard battle to push away Rinko. As Keiki struggled to break free… "Yuck…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki heard an oddly cold voice near him, and when he turned towards the voice, he spotted Nagase Airi with her usual chestnut-colored twintails giving the two boys a stare as cold as ice.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-senpai is flirting with a boy…" "I'm clearly not!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No such weird Rintarou x Keiki route existed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Ai-chan has arrived, I'll be taking my leave now! Arrivederci!" "Wait, hold on!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinko must have felt the imminent danger upon him. He let go immediately and ran away.</p>
<p class="null-p">That guy sure has beautiful legs despite being a boy…</p>
<p class="null-p">Information that nobody would ever care about filled Keiki's mind, and he heard Airi sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why were you two passionately embracing each other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He said he was pranking me by creating some kind of fake cheating scandal. Apparently he's angry that I stole Mizuha from him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, right. Mitani had a thing for Mizuha-senpai and all." "She didn't care about him at all, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, it was a shock for him, right? That's probably why he's wearing the female uniform right now, as a way to cope."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a horrible way to relieve stress…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Long ago, he had mentioned that he could pretty much only dress as a girl during the afternoon. Wearing the female uniform now must have been healing his broken heart at least a little bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, things seem to be working out quite well with you and Mizuha-senpai, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All thanks to your help, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the duty of a student council member to protect their students. Not to mention… that previous rumor was just taking it too far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are kind, Nagase-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm only kind towards girls. The reason I helped out wasn't for your sake, but because I felt bad for Mizuha-senpai. Make sure that you don't mess up your chance with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, of course." When Keiki responded with a confident tone, Airi made the first smile he'd seen her make today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…W-Well, if she ends up breaking up with you, I'll be there for you, so don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll keep that in mind." He put his hand on the girl's head. "Auuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally she'd brush his hand away with a cold 'Don't suddenly touch me like that', but now the girl just narrowed her eyebrows and let it be done to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nagase-san?" Shortly after, the girl let out a confused voice, and Keiki pulled his hand away. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like someone was watching us from the shadows… Maybe that was just my imagination…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki looked in the same direction that Airi did. However, he couldn't see anyone, and even Airi tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving Airi, Keiki satisfied his thirst with some strawberry milk, and after making a quick stop by his classroom, he headed to the student council office with a plastic bag in hand. Waiting there for him was Fujimoto Ayano,</p>
<p class="null-p">who had prepared some delicious black tea. Keiki kneeled down in front of her and offered her the plastic bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here are the goods you requested."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me inspect them." Ayano accepted the plastic bag and checked its contents.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was inside was an average men's t-shirt. It was colored a dark grey, made out of soft fabric. It might seem like nothing out of the ordinary, but for Keiki's respected student council president, there could be no greater object of gratitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…" Ayano inspected the item with an oddly serious gaze and even pressed it against her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">What followed that were a few deep breaths. After thoroughly sniffing the shirt, the girl slowly raised her head and flashed a satisfied, almost intoxicated, expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No doubt about it, this is your used shirt, Kiryuu-kun." "Naturally."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki didn't expect a smell fetishist like Ayano to be easily deceived, which was why he offered her a shirt he had worn all day before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would have preferred your underwear over this, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I considered it, but after thorough consideration, I arrived at the conclusion that I sure as hell ain't gonna give you my used underwear."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki truly was thankful for Ayano's assistance with that rumor that was going around school, and he wanted to fulfill whatever request she had, but giving a girl your age a pair of used underwear was crossing the line. That's why Keiki struck a deal with her by offering a used shirt instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, this is still a wonderful item, so I'll be using it plenty once I get home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Alright…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki decided not to think too deeply about how exactly Ayano would use that shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Either way, you really helped me with that rumor. Thanks." "If it's for you, I'll use my powers as much as I need to." "That surely is a problem, is it not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was great to know, but she might really ask for used underwear next time, so Keiki made a mental note to not rely on her power too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'll be heading back now." "Ah, wait…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?" Keiki turned around, only to find Ayano grabbing the sleeve of his uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think… that was enough… of a reward." "Huh? But I really can't give you my underwear…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't need that. I'll have you pay for the rest with your body." After saying this, Ayano closed the distance between the two of them and embraced Keiki from the front.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah, Fujimoto-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her slender arms wrapped around Keiki's back, and her chest pressed against Keiki's, sending shivers down his spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The best way to get Kiryuu-kun's scent is to directly smell it, after all." "Thanks, you saying that really helped me calm down a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">All of the indecent feelings rising up inside of Keiki vanished in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, this wasn't a reason to let her cling to him for all eternity. "…Um, Fujimoto-san? Could I ask you to let go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a bit longer… this will be the last time after all…" "Eh? Last time…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll make this the last time I'll directly cling to you when sniffing your scent."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means you'll still keep sniffing me in general, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How could I stop this? Sniffing your body odor has become Ayano-san's destiny."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can hardly see how this is destiny…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, if I can't enjoy a boy's scent during periodical intervals, I'll shrivel up and die. You're like my oasis at this school, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're acting like this is a respawn point in a game…" But, for some reason…</p>
<p class="null-p">More than sniffing my scent, this feels like an ordinary hug…</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, she'd be sniffing every part of his body at this point, to the point where Keiki would feel grossed out. Today, it felt like she was holding back from doing so, giving off no airs that she was actually a pervert at all. Keiki was busy thinking that it was weird when Ayano herself pulled away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Charging complete." "Are you okay now?" "Yup, fully charged." "I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I'm satisfied, I'll give Kiryuu-san the special right to make you her hugging pillow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't remember you having any right to decide that, Fujimoto-san." "I want to share this wonderful scent with Mizuha-san, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My scent isn't some kind of lucky item, is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While participating in this questionable conversation, a certain thought came to Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Fujimoto-san is just trying to be considerate?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since Keiki and Mizuha started dating, he had been a bit more distanced from the other girls, and Ayano must have been aware of this, which was why she said that this was the last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Maybe I don't mind giving you my used shirts from time to time." "Really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I wouldn't want you dying on me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had always been in Ayano's care. She might be a pervert, but deep down she was a kind person, so offering her an oasis wouldn't hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll be taking my leave now." "Yeah, thanks for giving me your shirt."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki bid farewell to Ayano and was about to return to his classroom. But when he put his hand on the doorknob, something felt off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?" "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I thought I shut the door all the way when I came in here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had checked that the door was latched properly. However, right now the door was slightly ajar, barely enough to allow someone to peek inside the room. Because of this odd occurrence, Keiki tilted his head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">After offering his used shirt to Ayano, Keiki made it through the afternoon classes, and by the time he made it to the clubroom, he let out a sigh while dropping his bag as he sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel oddly exhausted today…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This day had been filled with misbehaviour from various perverts. "Rinko's honey trap was especially bad…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being seduced by a boy right after getting a girlfriend was just too much. Compared to Ayano's gentle hug, it was no joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, each of them had blessed Keiki's relationship with Mizuha nonetheless. In that sense, it wasn't all bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh? Nii-san is the only one here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was just relaxing without doing anything in particular when the door opened and Mizuha peeked in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where's everyone else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan is busy with her work for the library committee, I haven't heard anything from Sayuki-senpai, and Nanjou is working on her manuscript."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha responded with the same attitude as always and put down her bag. The reason Keiki was practically staring at his lover wasn't because he was entranced by her, but rather because he felt like something was off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha, did something happen today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why are you asking?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know. You just look a bit bothered."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Weird. I'm not angry or anything, you know." Mizuha gave a perfect smile, denying Keiki's assumptions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's really good at hiding her honest feelings, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been hiding her feelings of love for her step-brother for several years. Keiki didn't expect to immediately get any kind of information from her. However, there was one easy way to figure out what was going on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha. Can I ask you something?" "What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you wearing your panties today?" "Fueh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Mizuha reflexively pulled down her skirt as she stood in front of her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…" And then her expression became much more easy to read. Her expression basically said 'I messed up'.</p>
<p class="null-p">She averted her eyes in an awkward fashion, probably as some kind of final resistance. Keiki had pretty much figured out what was going on from that, but he decided to confirm it one last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san… you're not wearing panties?" "Hm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yes, I'm not wearing any panties today."</p>
<p class="null-p">The accused admitted to her guilt. Keiki found out that his girlfriend came to school absolutely defenseless. Because of this abnormal high school life he was experiencing, he felt dizzy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I totally forgot because you've been behaving yourself lately, but you're still a pervert, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you still like me despite that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That doesn't mean I accept your exhibitionistic tendencies, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then again, Keiki had confessed to her while being aware of her fetish, so this kind of incident wouldn't make his love simmer down at all, but he still had a few complaints nonetheless. More important than that right now was the reason she hadn't worn any panties to school today.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever she has her no-panties days, it's because she's built up some kind of stress that she needs to cope with…</p>
<p class="null-p">This often happened when her beloved older brother got along exceptionally well with another girl. Judging from that, Mizuha must be displeased about something right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you… not wearing panties the entire day?" "No, I took them off during lunch break."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because… Nii-san went and cheated on me with other girls…" "Excuse me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was actually following you around today, Nii-san." "Following me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was quite the ominous term to use.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This morning, Takasaki-senpai told me to be careful because you're so popular."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her again…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It all made sense. Just like during Christmas last year, Shiho had been a troublemaker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So when I was looking into that, I saw you flirting around with Mitani-kun, patting Airi-chan on the head, being hugged by Fujimoto-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you saw that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Setting Mitani aside, because he was a boy, and the fact that Ayano had clung to him of her own volition without his consent, this was still bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now it makes sense why the door to the student council office was open…</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had observed Keiki's exchange with Ayano. She probably couldn't hear what they were talking about in detail, but it was still dangerous enough. Not to mention that she probably saw Keiki hand over his clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know it might sound weird coming from me, but that wasn't my intention, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that, but seeing Nii-san getting along with other girls still makes me jealous. I can't help it."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like she was accusing Keiki of cheating, but Keiki was fairly close to those girls, so that part was no joke. Keiki might not know how to properly handle it yet, but he knew how complicated a girl's heart could be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I understand what's going on." "…Nii-san, are you angry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am a bit pissed that you attended classes without wearing panties, but</p>
<p class="null-p">that's about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? You don't think I'm being annoying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all. If anything, I would be pretty sad if you didn't feel jealous at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was a pervert who purposefully took off her panties, Keiki couldn't help but think that she was cute as well. That's love for you. Keiki stood in front of his beloved little sister and gently smiled while rubbing her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that I made you worry. So I'll try my best to only have eyes for you from here on out, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, you don't need to hold back with me, okay? If there's anything you're worried about, then let me know. Tell me whatever you want me to do. I'm your boyfriend after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Okay." Mizuha must have felt relieved to hear that, because she showed Keiki a smile and nodded. "Then there's one thing I'd like to ask for right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, there's no need to hold back. Just tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to think about it. What is it that I want to do right now?" "What do you want to do…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I'll give you a hint." Mizuha slowly closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was more than a simple hint. It was probably nothing short of the answer itself, but it was rare to see her ask for something like this so earnestly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Knowing that he had made his cute girlfriend angry with his actions, Keiki didn't hesitate for a moment. He wrapped his arms around her back, pulling her closer. And then Keiki initiated his second kiss with her, filled with love and affection.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">After a moment passed, the two of them moved away from each other, and Mizuha bashfully put one hand on her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This really is pretty embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she seemed to have enjoyed that kiss, and she smiled happily at Keiki, her cheeks beet red.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: The Perverted Girls Started A Girls Meeting</p>
<p class="null-p">The first night upon entering March, Sayuki was wearing some casual clothes, relaxing on the sofa, when her mother Mifuyu walked towards her. She was a woman who possessed youth and beauty you wouldn't expect from someone who had a daughter of university student age. She was wearing red traditional clothes, with a stylish plastic bag in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Sayuki-chan. Your mother bought some new panties. Would you like to have a look?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really don't want to know what kind of panties my own mother is wearing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, how cold. They're quite lewd ones that have a hole right above my butt in the shape of a heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I take it back. I'm very much interested right now." Sayuki decided to have a look after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, these indeed are some wonderful panties."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were just what you would expect from a known panties collector. The panties Sayuki was inspecting were cute, yet alluring to the point that it even made Sayuki feel a bit horny. What a wonderful hobby her mother had, indeed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I have your positive impressions, I'll be using these to make your father fall for me all over again~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been thinking this a lot, but you two really are made for each other, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you put on these, Sayuki-chan, you could easily seduce that junior of yours, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Jeez."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that sigh for!? Did I say something weird!?" "Well, you sure did…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, Sayuki's mother would never suggest that she do that. "What's going on? You've been lacking energy as of late." "Well yeah, the boy I like got himself a girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? Kiryuu-kun has a girlfriend!? That's shocking…" "Why are you so shocked about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, I totally figured he was interested in you, Sayuki-chan. I was hoping to make him my son-in-law…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Too fast, Mom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never thought there would be a boy who couldn't be charmed by Sayuki- chan's breasts…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might sound like the howling of a loser, but I actually made it pretty far."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, Tokihara Sayuki was Keiki's first love. She was on the seat of the main heroine up until the very end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, the fish I lost was quite big…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was there even any other man out there who could be so gentle? Would there even ever be another man she could fall in love with? She said that she had</p>
<p class="null-p">no plans to give up on Keiki, but since he and Mizuha had crossed the line of being boyfriend and girlfriend and gone on to be engaged, there wasn't much Sayuki could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though he was my first love…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sayuki-chan…" Mifuyu put down the plastic bag and sat down next to Sayuki on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">She pulled Sayuki closer, and gently rubbed her on the head. "Come on, don't treat me like a child…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"From my point of view, you are still a child."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Sayuki had grown taller than her mother by now, she still felt like a small child compared to her mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. You're so cute, Sayuki-chan." "Mom…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know you can steal that Kiryuu-kun back~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think you should be encouraging your own daughter to do that sort of stuff, Mom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Knowing you, you weren't planning on giving up anyway, were you?" "That… might be true, but…" Sayuki's mother had read her like a book. A mother really knows a daughter's personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, what is Kiryuu-kun's girlfriend like? Is she from the calligraphy club? Is she that blonde-haired girl? The red-haired girl? I'm quite curious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someone sure can't contain their curiosity."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to her mother's endless energy, Sayuki wasn't even given the time to</p>
<p class="null-p">be depressed. After seeing her mother's warm smile, Sayuki decided to tell her who Keiki's girlfriend was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's his little sister Mizuha-san. They're not related."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really!? I didn't expect him to take the little sister route… But I do quite like the whole idea of forbidden love between siblings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You watch a lot of dramas like that, don't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since they weren't related by blood, and were thus only step-siblings, there wasn't anything forbidden about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Oh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? What's wrong, Mom?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just thinking… Doesn't that mean that the two of them are living under the same roof?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, the house is mostly empty except for them because their parents are working all the time, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would assume so, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their parents seemed to be busy at work, which was why they rarely came home. As a result, the two of them had mostly been living alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A young couple living together, not to mention with no parents around…" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They must be going at it every night." "What… did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Going at it every night? In other words, they were going at it like rabbits?</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally Sayuki would shoot her mother down when she said things like this, but the shock was too much for her. A lewd scene filled Sayuki's mind, making her whole face turn red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-kun and Mizuha-san are…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't entirely impossible. Right now, the two of them were lovers. Keiki was never the assertive type, but even he was a healthy young man in his adolescence. Not to mention that his little sister was hungry enough to even assault him in his sleep. With these two sleeping under the same roof, there's no way that nothing would happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like I need to look into that some more…"</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"So with that said, I'd like to open up the very first calligraphy club girls meeting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the Friday afternoon after classes had ended, Sayuki spoke with determination in front of Mizuha, Mao, and Yuika.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The first? You're going to graduate soon, Witch-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who cares about the small stuff? As this club's special advisor, I'll be stopping by from time to time to check in on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? What's up with that, Yuika hasn't heard anything about this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I told Okita-sensei that I'd like to give you guidance beyond my graduation, she agreed fairly quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our school is pretty relaxed about such things, huh?" Mao gave a nonchalant comment, the opposite of Yuika's shocked reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just when Yuika thought she had finally gotten rid of Witch-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or so you say, but you're happy that your kind Senpai will be looking after you from time to time, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all. Wait, Witch-senpai!? Why are you suddenly patting Yuika on the head!? You're messing up her hair!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika and Sayuki started a fight. Though instead of a fight, it was more like a one-sided battle where Yuika was being spoiled. Mizuha watched over this usual banter between the members and decided to speak up for herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what kind of gathering is this supposed to be?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she asked this question, the other three girls stopped moving abruptly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What's this atmosphere about?" Mizuha felt the air around her change and tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one to break this long and awkward silence was the oldest girl in the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of gathering? We want to ask how far you've gone with Keiki- kun of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?" Upon hearing the goal of this meeting, Mizuha blinked a few times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if we don't say it out loud, we're all curious about how things are going. That's why you'll be telling us about this and that and what you've done with Keiki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha looked between Yuika and Mao, asking for help. However, the two of them awkwardly averted their gazes, signaling that they were on Sayuki's side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh… um… I have to prepare for dinner tonight, so I'll be taking my leave</p>
<p class="null-p">now…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koga-san, lock the door!" "Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha felt imminent danger to her personal safety, so she hurriedly got up from her seat, but Yuika dashed towards the door and locked it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika-chan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Mizuha-senpai, but Yuika wants to hear as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just give up. You won't be going home until you tell us everything." "Even Mao-chan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha had no room to escape. With the blonde junior pushing her back, Mizuha was forced to sit down on her chair again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So what do you want to hear, then?" "How far have you gone with Keiki-kun?" "I figured this would happen…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha and Keiki were the first couple that had been formed inside the calligraphy club. It was no surprise that the other girls were curious about their progress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… we've had sex several times." "Sex!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she dropped this bombshell, Sayuki and the other two shot towards Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san can be really spoiled when it's just the two of us. He clings to me all the time, and before I realize it, it's already morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Until morning!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three girls imagined that scene and they all blushed profusely. "K-Keiki-kun is pretty amazing, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai is way too different in bed…" "Kiryuu sure gets assertive with girls, huh…?" "Nii-san is only interested in girls, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha did her best to protect her older brother's honor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that makes sense… You're living together under the same roof, and there's no way that even Keiki-kun could hold back with a cute girlfriend like Mizuha-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai really loves big breasts after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like my favorite pairing just shattered into pieces…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They all slumped their shoulders in defeat, all of them suffering from quite a shock. Mizuha thought that maybe she had taken this prank too far, so she cleared the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or at least I wish Nii-san would be a wolf like that." "…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sayuki, Mao, and Yuika all stared at Mizuha in disbelief, asking for clarification.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We haven't gone any further than kissing, actually."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Of course, I've been trying to approach Nii-san here and there, but as you all know…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…" Sayuki nodded in consent.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no surprise how dense Keiki could be. "Basically, Kiryuu is still a virgin…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so is Mizuha-senpai…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were being pretty blunt about it, but that's how discussions between girls go. Girls indeed are not as pure and innocent as guys think they are.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But are you fine with that, Mizuha-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly speaking, I'd love to progress further than that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course Mizuha wanted to do these sorts of things with the boy she liked. However, she also didn't want to rush things. If she was the same person she had been not too long ago, she might have been able to pull it off, but now that they were dating, she wanted to be together only with his consent.</p>
<p class="null-p">If possible, I want Nii-san to take the first step…</p>
<p class="null-p">They were holding hands, and even kissing. However, there had never been any atmosphere that would lead beyond that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that he's just treasuring me in his own way, and I'm happy about that, but since I'm a girl, I also want Nii-san to take the lead and…" Mizuha spoke her honest feelings as she was blushing furiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt scared of being seen as lewd and off-putting, so she can't tell her older brother about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-senpai is so cute…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm worried about Keiki-kun for different reasons now. He's not laying his hands on such an adorable girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How disappointing of him…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nii-san isn't the one to be blamed, okay? We might not be related by blood, but we're still siblings, so the hurdle is just that much higher compared to a normal girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha herself wasn't exactly dissatisfied with their current relationship. After all these years of harboring one-sided feelings, she had finally achieved a mutual love with the person she loved, so that was a source of plenty of happiness for her. Asking for any more than that would just be greedy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you tried to seduce him, we're talking about Keiki-kun after all… He never gave in to me no matter how many times I pressed my breasts against him, so I feel like normal seduction techniques won't work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since Yuika's attacks worked, he clearly is interested in girls though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would always see him grinning when he was surrounded by the club prez and Yuika."</p>
<p class="null-p">All of them agreed in their own right. After all, Keiki was still a guy, so there was no way he wouldn't be conscious of Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Mizuha-san, what kind of approaches have you tried so far?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I would show him my chest after dinner, flashing my thighs here and there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. What was Keiki-kun's reaction?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm… It seemed like he noticed, but he wasn't exactly jumping at me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha-san always welcomed just about anything, but because Keiki was constantly being seduced by the girls in the calligraphy club and yet hadn't succumbed to temptation, it was clear that something of this level wouldn't turn him into a wild beast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I tried to take on a more cold and distant attitude, but his puppy eyes were too strong so I had to stop."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you wanted him to push you down, but it made you want to push him down instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If this was Yuika, she wouldn't stop until the other person cried and begged for forgiveness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you feel bad for Kiryuu?" Mao made a harsh retort. "Why not be honest and ask him for it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh? Wouldn't he be disappointed in me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"With someone as dense as Keiki-kun, you need to be direct with him or he'll never get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds very convincing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Sayuki pointed out, directness was your best bet when dealing with Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Keiki-senpai is more of an M after all. If you approach him fiercely, he'll fall soon enough!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Keiki-kun is a sadist, so inviting him will work much better!" "You could also get Mizuha to dress as a boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuika, Sayuki, and Mao all gave their own advice, but Mizuha couldn't really work with any of it. Her older brother wasn't a sadist or a masochist, nor was he into boys' clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, they're actually trying to come up with ways to help me…</p>
<p class="null-p">In all honesty, Mizuha was quite surprised. She didn't expect the three of</p>
<p class="null-p">them to support her this much, considering they all had feelings for her boyfriend. They might be perverts rotten to the core, but they were still kind. Mizuha yet again understood why her older brother liked this club so much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That reminds me, when did you even fall in love with Keiki-senpai, Mizuha- senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I became aware of it back in middle school. Just from staying with him, I realized that I felt more for him than just what a family member would."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm? That's a long time." "What about you, Yuika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-We weren't talking about Yuika!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I wanted to hear about that as well. I was wondering how Keiki-kun managed to steal the heart of such an exhausting girl like Koga-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuika really doesn't want to be called exhausting by Witch-senpai of all people!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As this average and nonchalant exchange continued, Mizuha smiled. With this new subject on the table, this girls' meeting would not end anytime soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time as this was going on, Keiki had been invited out to a cafe by Shouma and Koharu. They sat in a booth by the window, with two hot coffee cups sitting on the table in front of the boys, whereas Koharu ordered a cheesecake and tea set. While the two boys watched over her with a warm gaze, Koharu thoroughly enjoyed the cheesecake with her legs kicking up and down. She was as cute of a girl as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not with Mizuha-chan today, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apparently there's some girls' meeting in the calligraphy club today." "Is that so? Sounds like it'd be a wonderful sight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's the normal sight you'd expect, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot of cute girls gathered together, talking about love and flowers and all of that. That was Koharu's image of the calligraphy club's meeting, but was it really like this? Keiki found himself doubting that, knowing the particular interests of the club members that would be present. Keiki doubted that this meeting would end safely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, Keiki got a girlfriend… I never thought I would witness it with my own eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiryuu-kun always talked about how he wanted a cute girlfriend, but nothing ever seemed to come of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's all thanks to you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki received a lot of advice from the two during the Cinderella incident. They assisted him during the double date, and Koharu even let Mizuha stay over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How does it feel living together with your girlfriend?" "To put it simply, it's pure bliss."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was of the opinion that things were working out pretty well with Mizuha. A few days after they started dating, there wasn't any extreme change in their relationship, but Keiki felt like the distance between them had shrunk. Just the fact that their feelings had come together was enough to make Keiki feel satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good for you, Kiryuu-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thank you very much." Keiki gave his gratitude as his upperclassman gently smiled. "So I need some advice from you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Do you need some more advice for a date?" "Do you not know where to take it from here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing is…" Keiki dropped his gaze down towards his coffee. "The chance of us breaking up is on the table right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of this sudden turn of events, both Shouma and Koharu leaned forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that!?" "Wasn't everything going well!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well, maybe I said too much. I'm having a bit of trouble, but it's not that we might break up any day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't scare me like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought my heart was going to stop…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouma and Koharu fell backwards on their seats, sighing in relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's about Mizuha…" Keiki reflected on his mistake and chose his words more carefully as he continued explaining. "I feel like Mizuha is acting off as of late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"First, she's way too defenseless. She walks around while barely wearing anything, she flashes her breasts right after a bath, and so on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is quite bold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's tough, especially because Mizuha's breasts are so big. I can see her cleavage every single time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cleavage…" Koharu muttered, and looked down at her own chest. "It's fine, Koharu-chan! I have zero interest in any cleavage!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shouma-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two suddenly entered a world of their own, holding hands with each other, but Keiki ignored them and continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beyond that… There was a time when Mizuha suddenly acted really cold towards me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cold in what way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I offered to dry her hair after she finished her bath, but she just averted her gaze and said she didn't need any help… Even though she used to be the one who would ask for it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is quite distant, indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What if she just happened to be in a bad mood?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's possible, but that would make me wonder what she was angry about."</p>
<p class="null-p">Showing her chest, suddenly being distant…</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's also a lot of times when Mizuha just sighs to herself…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the thing Keiki was the most curious about. A lot of times, Mizuha would just space out, clearly thinking about something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might just be my imagination, but it seems like Mizuha lacks her usual energy. As her boyfriend, I want to do something about it, so I was wondering what she was worrying about…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That does sound odd…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Koharu put one hand on her chin, thinking about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just to confirm: How do you spend your days as an official couple now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eating lunch together, watching movies in the living room, talking in my room. I don't think much has changed since we started dating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe that's the reason? Mizuha might not be satisfied with our current life?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Knowing Mizuha-chan, I don't think that's what it is." "What was Mizuha-san like when watching the movie?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you mention it, she would hold my hand pretty often during the movie, and she seemed satisfied with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I don't think she has any complaints so far…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three of them made their guesses about Mizuha's odd behaviour, but none of them could come up with any plausible explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I just ask Mizuha-san myself?" Koharu asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm…" Keiki thought about it for a bit, but then shook his head. "I'll hold off on that for now. I've made plans to spend the entire day with Mizuha tomorrow, so I'll ask her myself if the time comes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't ask for advice every time some small problem happened. Just having been heard out was enough for Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, I'll think about how to cheer Mizuha up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be something that was hard to tell others. Because of that, Keiki could only wait for Mizuha to tell him herself, and try to make it easier for her to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just for a reference, what things could you do for each other that would make you happy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what Shouma-kun could do for me to make me happy?" Koharu looked</p>
<p class="null-p">at her boyfriend. "Well… being hugged, being kissed. Those sorts of things would make me happy, I guess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Koharu-chan is so cute that I want to do it right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd love to tell you to explode right away, but I'm no different when it comes to Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was happy to see that his friends' relationship was blooming as well as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, I don't want to speak for the majority of all girls, but I think we love feeling special."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Special?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. For example, getting a limited edition pudding from the convenience store, going to a sale at the end of the year, that sort of thing. Feeling special with these sorts of small things has a lot of value to us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, now that you mention it, I can see that with Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki came back with some special pudding, she was really happy about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, going on a trip might be a good idea as well." "A trip?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Going on a trip or vacation with your lover over a weekend helps a lot with feeling special."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. That makes sense…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Going on a trip with your lover did indeed sound wonderful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, going on a trip requires a lot of preparations, and that means you can't leave right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right." Keiki agreed that it was charming, but it was hard to execute. "Thank you very much for your help. I'll give it some thought." Keiki voiced his gratitude and gulped down the rest of his cold coffee.</p>
<p class="null-p">When his cup was empty, that day's advice session came to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">While making his way home from the cafe, Keiki thought about Koharu's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A trip, huh…? It'd be great if I could invite Mizuha, but…" It was pretty hard to simply plan a trip like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't even know where to start…"</p>
<p class="null-p">You'd need money for the expenses, an idea of where to go, and time set aside to do so. Staying at a hotel was practically impossible for a student's financial situation. They might be able to scrape the money together with their New Year's money, but thanks to Mizuha's goals of saving as much money as possible, that probably wouldn't work out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I start working part-time now, I won't get my pay for another month…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he earned more money by himself, Mizuha surely wouldn't say no, but then the time was another problem. No matter what Keiki tried to come up with, it didn't sound like it would work out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm… I guess a trip is impossible after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki muttered to himself as he walked along the street. The smartphone in his pocket started vibrating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's from Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he checked it, the name of his beloved little sister was on the screen. The message itself read 'Can I ask you to go on an errand for me? There's a limited sale on soy sauce, but I can't go there right now, so could you buy some for me?'. After Keiki finished reading the message, he started grinning</p>
<p class="null-p">to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sort of thing really feels like we're newlyweds."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though this had happened countless times before, now the context had changed, since Keiki and Mizuha were dating with marriage in mind. Just from a simple change in your relationship, your entire worldview can change with it. Naturally, this was a positive change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki responded with a brief 'Roger!', stuffed away his phone, and headed to the store near their home. Since Keiki had visited that store several times before, he immediately found his way to the aisle with the soy sauce and put several bottles into his shopping basket. After paying, Keiki left the store again with a plastic bag in hand as well as a small piece of paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They gave me a lottery ticket, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Many nearby stores would give you a lottery ticket with a purchase of above 10,000 yen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might as well." Keiki nodded to himself and approached the small lottery area.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was your average small stand in front of a bookstore, but… "Oh, it's Kei-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's been a while, Kei-chan." "Asahi-san and Yuuhi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon arriving, he was greeted by the two Akiyama sisters, who were standing next to the lottery machine on a small desk. The tall lady with short hair was Asahi, and the lady with long hair was Yuuhi. The two were wearing clothes befitting their beauty, along with a Japanese happi coat like you'd see people wearing to festivals.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you working here part-time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. They were looking for helpers, so Yuuhi-chan and I both applied." "Girls like us need a lot of money for things, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is true."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha wore western clothes pretty often, and a trip to the beauty salon isn't exactly cheap either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you get a lottery ticket, Kei-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. I was just shopping at the store over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then let's have you try your luck." Asahi-san said, putting her hand on the raffle machine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The first prize hasn't been drawn yet, so you still have a chance." Yuuhi-san added.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you say, but the best I've ever gotten from these things is a packet of tissues."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tissues were popular participation prizes. Keiki didn't expect much this time either, so he was pretty much expecting to get the tissues.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should be a bit more excited, you know." "Meaning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, the first prize is a free pass to a hot spring inn for two people!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A what now?" Keiki was a bit confused by Asahi's words, so Yuuhi cut in to explain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You get a day pass for a hot spring that's collaborating with us." "Huh, sounds nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being able to go to a hot springs inn for free was quite a luxurious prize.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, letting you stay for a day would hurt the budget, so it'll be a same-day trip."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if you were to win this ticket, I'm sure your girlfriend would be happy, Kei-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Did I tell you that I got a girlfriend?" "Shou-kun and Koharu-chan told us." "Aren't you a lucky guy, Kei-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">These siblings were as close as always. Keiki felt happy to be blessed by them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A hot spring trip with my girlfriend, huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki never expected such a chance to arrive right after Koharu talked about it. Keiki had expected it to be a one day and night trip, but if it was a same- day trip, then it would be easier to find the time to invite her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha likes taking hot baths after all, so I bet she'd be happy…</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could already see the girl's face pop up in the back of his head. This might be the perfect thing to cheer up Mizuha after she'd been down for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I'll definitely get the first prize." "Ohh, you're all motivated now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it's not like you can do much with motivation alone." Asahi pointed out while Keiki spun the lever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come to me, first prize!" Keiki screamed in hope.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shortly afterwards, a small round marble fell out of the exit. It was colored a silk-like white…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this the first prize?!" "Nope, participation." "I figured as much~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The challenge failed after the first attempt. There was no hope for the young man. In reality, Keiki never had much hope to begin with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine! You just have to keep buying stuff until you get it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Asahi-san, do I look like I have that much money?" Keiki was miffed by Asahi's comment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, don't be sad about it, okay? You can just try another time." "We'll be cheering you on, Kei-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your words, they hurt me…" Keiki didn't appreciate such overly kind words. "Then I'll be taking the participation prize at least." Keiki stuffed the tissues into his pocket, when…</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Lady, let me spin the wheel!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A somewhat energetic customer walked up next to him and offered Asahi their lottery ticket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, time to get the first prize!" The customer grabbed the lever and started turning it.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki looked over, he realized that it was a girl wearing the same uniform from his school-</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Takasaki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …Keiki-kun?" The hand on the lever stopped, and the person turned</p>
<p class="null-p">towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, it was Takasaki Shiho, wearing a coat over her uniform. "-Congratulations! You won the first prize!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they heard Asahi's excited voice, both Keiki and Shiho turned towards the raffle and spotted a golden marble falling out from the bottom…</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"At least you got close, Kei-chan." Yuuhi gave a troubled smile as she rang the small bell in her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Shiho asked 'How about we talk for a bit?', and took Keiki to a nearby park. They sat down on the swings. There, Shiho spoke up with a cheerful tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I got this ticket at a nearby bookstore, so I thought I'd try my luck, but I didn't think I'd actually win."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you pretty lucky or something, Takasaki-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder. I feel like I'm getting a lot of rare item drops in games recently." "Good for you…" Keiki felt jealous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki usually had to farm for such items for hours. "So what did you want to talk about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, right. Well, it's not that big of a deal. You got yourself a girlfriend right, Keiki-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sure did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I figured I should take the position as your girlfriend myself." "Excuse me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's not that I'm telling you to break up with her and date me instead. If anything, I'd prefer it if you could date both myself and her at the same time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what you call two-timing, right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you know how I prefer guys who are already in a relationship." "Oh lord…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Takasaki Shiho is a pervert who gets off to being cucked. Or rather, she likes both sides of the NTR coin. She's probably one of the biggest perverts Keiki has encountered in his days on the planet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that you have a cute girlfriend, I feel like you're a much bigger target than ever, you know… Is that too much to ask for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It most certainly is." "Ahh, I've been rejected."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, Keiki didn't hesitate for a second to reject her offer. "Even though a beauty like me invited you… how cruel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I only have eyes for Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm… She really is loved… I'm a bit jealous." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that just makes me want to steal you even more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I just go now?" Keiki felt exhausted dealing with the girl. "Oh yeah, you told Mizuha something weird, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something weird?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Saying that she should be careful of me cheating on her or something." "Ahh, that might have happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to that, she was following me around all day, making sure I wasn't cheating."</p>
<p class="null-p">You could even say that she was stalking him all day, but this jealousy was cute in its own right, so Keiki quickly forgave her. The latter half was pretty much just them flirting around, so Keiki didn't mention that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you say something like that to Mizuha?" "I just felt like paying you back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Paying me back? What for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You made my adorable junior cry after all." "What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not even aware of it… what a sinful man you are, Keiki-kun." "I seriously don't know, okay…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The only juniors of Shiho Keiki could think of were Ayano and Airi, but he had no recollection of making either the two cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, I was just venting my anger, so don't worry about it." "Venting your anger for what…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though I probably did something bad to you, so I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, as long as you're reflecting on it, it's fine." Keiki felt like he was being a bit too kind on her, but since she seemed like she felt bad, he decided to leave it at that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, it's time for me to leave." Shiho got up from the swing, and Keiki joined her. "Oh right, take this as an apology."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Isn't this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiho turned around to offer Keiki two tickets. They were the free passes for the hot spring that she had gotten from the lottery.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seemed like you wanted them, so take them." "Are you sure?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. I don't have anybody to go with. Unless you want to go there with me for a rendezvous of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't start two-timing, okay?" Keiki yet again didn't hesitate a moment. "Well, just go and have fun with Mizuha-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I don't mind if I do. Thank you very much." Keiki expressed his gratitude and accepted the tickets.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lottery might have ended badly, but Keiki still somehow had gotten the tickets he wanted. Now Keiki might be able to go on the trip together after all. With these hopeful thoughts in mind, he parted ways from his senior and made his way home.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Mizuha's home as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki came home, the front door was already unlocked. It appeared as if the girls meeting had ended as well. Keiki let out a cheerful 'I'm home' and took off his shoes. Shortly after, Mizuha came walking towards him, already having changed into some comfortable clothes. She stood in front of her older brother and gave him a beaming smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome back, Mr Pig~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What?" Keiki's eyebrows shot up. He stared at Mizuha in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, it sounded like quite a strange word had come out of her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you mind washing your hands? I'm preparing some fodder for you, Mr Pig."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's this about!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki apparently hadn't misheard. Mizuha most definitely was calling Keiki 'Pig', even calling his meal 'Fodder' after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you calling me a pig right after I get home!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, would you like your welcome back kick to the face? I don't mind stepping on you either, if it's all for my favorite Mr Pig~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen to me!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha started sounding even more crazy than before. Stepping on others was something she usually wouldn't even dream of.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something you're not satisfied with, Mr Pig?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a pig. There are a great many things I'm not satisfied with. Why are you suddenly calling me a pig?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you curious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I had to guess, this is probably some kind of awful advice from Yuika- chan or Sayuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, you guessed it right away." "It wasn't hard at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way a girl who's an exhibitionist and nothing more would</p>
<p class="null-p">suddenly start going around calling people 'pig.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"During the meeting we had today, I asked them what I should do in order to make you happy, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So since we thought you might be either a sadist or a masochist, we decided to go with a maid-like tone, and that I should call you 'pig' to help excite you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who thought that was a good idea?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There were lots of plot holes in that movie script. Kiryuu Keiki was neither a</p>
<p class="null-p">sadist nor a masochist, and he wasn't some weird hybrid kind of pervert either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you happy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you think I'd be happy to be called a pig right after coming home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…" Mizuha lowered her head like a puppy that had just been scolded. "Maybe I should have worn a tuxedo and pushed you down after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was Nanjou, right? That could have only come from her."</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant male clothes came up in the conversation, the perpetrator was clear as day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what kind of welcome would make you happy, Nii-san?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… you know. I'd already be more than happy to be hugged by the girl I love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That kind of roleplay is enough?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't call it 'roleplay.' I just prefer something normal." Keiki felt a bit embarrassed, but even so, that's what he had always admired.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then-" Mizuha walked towards him and embraced him from the front. "Welcome back, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah… I'm home…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This surprised him, and Keiki stumbled over his words. Receiving a welcome home hug really made it feel like they were married.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How was that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have any more regrets in this world." "That good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd love for you to do that every day, but I'd probably get used to it, so every</p>
<p class="null-p">once in a while is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds complicated, but I'll try my best." Mizuha nodded and moved away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since just standing in the entrance would be too cold, they moved to the living room. Keiki put down his student bag and the plastic bag, and was thus reminded of the ticket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This might be a bit sudden, but how about we go to some hot springs tomorrow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hot springs? That sure is sudden."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing is, I just got this from Takasaki-senpai…" Keiki explained, and took out the tickets from his pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this, a hot spring free pass…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai won the first prize, which apparently is this free pass to these hot springs. It's only for one day, so we'd have to come back on the same day. It might be sudden, but what do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? So it'll be just the two of us?" "Indeedo. How does that sound?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanna go!" Mizuha immediately agreed, her eyes sparkling in joy. "Then let's prepare right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup!" She nodded with a beaming smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her happy made Keiki feel relieved. He was afraid that Mizuha would reject him with some distant attitude. Keiki felt a bit guilty that this was so sudden, but if they let this week pass, they won't have many more chances, so tomorrow was their best bet.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have to prepare some stuff on my end as well…</p>
<p class="null-p">Tomorrow, the third of March, was a special day for Mizuha. And it was also the day Keiki decided to put his plan into action.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: So This is Mixed Bathing, So What?</p>
<p class="null-p">Early in the morning on the weekend, Keiki and Mizuha left their home after finishing all of their preparations. They only took the utmost necessities with them, each of them carrying a small backpack on their shoulders as they headed towards the train station. Shortly afterwards, they boarded a train driving in the opposite direction they would usually go. After they sat down in a small corner with no other people around, the train started moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm looking forward to the hot spring." "You love taking baths after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I need to thank Takasaki-senpai for the tickets." "We should probably buy her some souvenirs."</p>
<p class="null-p">The hot springs they were heading to were located at the foot of the mountain, a trip which took about two hours by train. Since this was a popular tourist destination, they should be able to easily find some souvenirs to buy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Nii-san. I wore some clothes that allow for easy movement, but… what do you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmmm…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing that question, Keiki once again inspected Mizuha's appearance. Today, she was wearing a white blouse along with a short and stylish skirt, and a knitted cardigan on top to protect her from the cold. Underneath, she was wearing tights. It was the kind of outfit you'd wear to survive the cold up in the mountains.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, it looks great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? I was thinking that maybe I should have worn something more open."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's still cold, so this is totally fine. Not to mention that you look cute no matter what you wear."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really? Ehehe…" Mizuha made a happy smile when she praised him. Seeing her acting this delighted made Keiki feel all warm inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm also wearing panties today, so there's no need to worry." "For the record, you'd better be wearing them every day, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the two of them took a picture together. It was a simple selfie with the train seats behind them, and they took several of them despite not even having made it to their destination yet. They put their shoulders together, and while they looked at all the pictures they had taken, Mizuha once again let out a snicker.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"It really feels like we're a couple, doesn't it?" "I mean, we are a couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is pretty embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's still early in the train ride, so you can take a nap if you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a child." Mizuha said, yet she still rested her head on Keiki's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you weren't a child?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not sleepy, but I felt like flirting around for a bit." "I guess it can't be helped then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because hardly anyone else was around, Keiki felt no resistance towards her acting spoiled. On the contrary, he was very welcoming of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems like she's in a good mood today.</p>
<p class="null-p">The trip must have done a great deal for Mizuha's mood, or maybe she just felt like being spoiled a bit, but Keiki was happy as long as Mizuha was happy. And so, Keiki decided to flirt with her as much as she desired until they made it to their destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">A bit past 9am, the two of them arrived at their destination and the hot springs. What greeted them right upon leaving the train station was the distinct smell of hot springs, as well as a cluster of old-fashioned buildings that seemed right at home among the mountains. There was a slope leading up the hill with several bathhouses and inns lined up along the sides, awakening your desire to adventure, which naturally caused Mizuha's eyes to light up in joy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A lot of people are here, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The weather's superb, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki raised his gaze upwards, he was greeted by the blue sky. No clouds were in sight. It was the perfect weather and time of day to make people go outside, so the place would probably be even more crowded once noontime rolled around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I carry your stuff?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. We won't be staying for the night, so I only have some changes of clothes and my underwear with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">While walking, Mizuha pointed at the bag hanging down her shoulder. Compared to Keiki's small backpack, it was quite a lot bigger, but it was only filled with clothes, so it seemed that it wasn't that heavy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then should we walk around a bit?" "Yup!"</p>
<p class="null-p">First, the two of them decided to check out the area. The first thing on their list was a footbath. They took off their shoes and socks beneath a roof and sat down next to each other on a bench. Since Mizuha had been wearing tights, she took them off after Keiki sat down on the bench, but even the faint rustling of clothes along with her occasional breath was more than stimulating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Great legs, m'lady."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sound like a cringy discord mod, Nii-san." "Oh whoops, my honest feelings leaked out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Mizuha's legs were such a beautiful sight to behold, Keiki couldn't help but compliment them. It made him sound like somewhat of a pervert, but the exhibitionistic Mizuha felt stimulated all the same, and grinned visibly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once both of their preparations were done, they slowly dipped their feet into the water.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh, it's so warm." "You're right. It feels great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've used a footbath, and it's not half bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">The temperature of the water was just perfect, making you feel all warm and fuzzy from the feet upwards. Since it was early March, it was starting to slowly warm up, but here at the foot of the mountain, you couldn't be too careless with the cold. Since the footbath was out in the open, they covered the rest of their bodies by snuggling up close to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think that a footbath would be this great of a place to flirt." "You're right. I wouldn't mind staying here forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like our legs would end up getting wrinkly if we did that."</p>
<p class="null-p">After their footbath, they went to check out the hot springs nearby. The first one they entered was an old bath house that clearly had a lot of history, big enough to house at least 100 people. Unlike the footbath, this time men and women were separated. Even so, knowing that your lover was waiting after the bath was one of the best feelings of the day so far.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a great bath that was~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, Mizuha-san seems to be in a wonderful mood." "It was the best. I want to have one at home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd love to grant that wish, but I really doubt we can buy an entire hot spring."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. Being able to experience it every once in a while is what makes it so great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah, you're right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha's smile was so adorable that it made Keiki's heart skip a beat. He</p>
<p class="null-p">tried to remain calm about it, but it was impossible to hide after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, what's wrong? Your face is a bit red… Were you in there too long?" Mizuha looked at Keiki with a somewhat worried gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it wasn't anything worth hiding, Keiki decided to just be honest. "How do I say this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you came out of the bath, you were just so beautiful that I was completely entranced."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a sudden surprise attack. Because Keiki suddenly spoke rare words of affection, Mizuha's cheeks turned even redder than they had been before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you can see me like this every day…" "Well, you're not wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the reason she looked more adorable than before was surely the effect of the hot spring.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can always join me when I'm taking a bath at home, Nii-san." "Where did that come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just felt like saying it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that supposed to mean? Also, that's definitely too embarrassing." "I'm totally fine, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well I wouldn't be."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki's rational thinking and reason might break right then and there. Setting</p>
<p class="null-p">aside the time when Keiki wasn't conscious of Mizuha yet, now that the two had become lovers, if she were to stand in front of Keiki right now, utterly naked, he didn't have the confidence that he could hold back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Nii-san! There's another footbath over there!" "Let's check it out then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha pointed in a direction and started walking that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems like she's enjoying herself. Alright, I'd better keep this momentum going.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today's goal was to ensure some proper refreshing relaxation for Mizuha. Keiki nodded to himself, feeling that he was making great progress towards that goal. He walked after Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the two of them thoroughly enjoyed their trip. They checked out the hot springs, took pictures in the labyrinth-like slope path, ate some dango at a store on the way, and so on. Just walking around the place was so much fun. Around noon, the two of them were walking alongside a river.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha suddenly stopped walking and looked towards the river. "There's a girl…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki followed Mizuha's gaze and spotted a young girl standing on the small asphalt path next to the river. However, something seemed off. She was covering her face with both her hands and seemed to be crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe she's lost?" "Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, let's call out to her."</p>
<p class="null-p">No one else was around her after all, and leaving a lost child alone would be too cruel. They didn't know the circumstances, but acting like they didn't see anything was not an option for either Keiki or Mizuha. They used the concrete stairs to walk down next to the river and called out to the crying girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?" The girl raised her head in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed to be in the early years of grade school. She had a pouch around her shoulder and was wearing a long, warm one-piece. She had about the same hair length as Mizuha, and even a hairpin in the shape of a feather in her hair. Her face was somewhat cute, but it was drenched in tears right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Who are you two?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're not anybody suspicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're just tourists who happened to be walking by." "Really…" The girl closely inspected the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">She apparently wasn't fully convinced yet. After a short silence, the girl spoke up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I going to get kidnapped?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no, we won't take you away or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We just saw you crying here, so we were wondering if something had happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…? I'm sorry that I troubled you like that." "Ohh… She sure is polite."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl rubbed her eyes as she apologized. Since she had stopped crying,</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Mizuha decided to hear her out. "Can I ask for your name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It's Miu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miu-chan, I see. Why were you crying just now?" "That's…" For a moment, the girl grew silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she shortly after opened her mouth again, like she made up her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, are you two newlyweds?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Met with this unexpected question, Keiki and Mizuha looked at each other in confusion. The intent behind her question was questionable, but in order to keep the conversation going, Keiki took it upon himself to answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right now we aren't, but we do plan on getting married in the future." "…If you are, then you don't understand how I feel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought he'd given a proper answer, but the girl just made a blank expression, leaving him clueless as to what was going on. Upon seeing this, Mizuha took over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miu-chan, why do we not understand?" "That's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha crouched down in order to meet the girl's gaze and spoke with a gentle voice, and the girl started tearing up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was… rejected by the boy I like just now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I told Ma-kun to marry me… he said no… So there's no way you newlyweds would understand… what I feel…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…" Mizuha made a complicated expression. Keiki joined in with an equally surprised reaction. "So that's why you were crying…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was indeed a complicated problem. Even so, Mizuha tried to continue with an energetic voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But won't your family be worried if you don't get back soon?" "…I don't want to go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ma-kun lives next to me, so if I go home, he'll see that I cried, and it'll be awkward…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It appears that Ma-kun was Miu's childhood friend. Not to mention that they live right next to each other. Mizuha took out a handkerchief and gently wiped away Miu's tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm pretty sure that Ma-kun likes you, Miu-chan." "Eh? Why do you think that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are times when people happen to say the opposite of what you really feel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. Especially boys your age. They have a hard time being honest at</p>
<p class="null-p">times."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right… Ma-kun can be a bit like that at times…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He might have been surprised because you suddenly asked him to marry you. First, you should tell him how you feel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…" Miu-chan started fidgeting. "Will Ma-kun even listen to me…?" "It'll be fine. You're really cute after all, Miu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onee-san…" Miu-chan gazed at Mizuha in admiration. After that, she suddenly clung to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Miu-chan…?" Mizuha was bewildered from this sudden hug. Miu-chan, for her part, seemed equally shocked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onee-san, you have bigger breasts than Mama…" "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pfffft!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could hardly be blamed for where his gaze went immediately following that statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onee-san, I'll try my best!" "Yup. I'm sure he'll be happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe~!" Miu-chan showed a warm smile as Mizuha rubbed her on the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's finally calmed down, huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that they understood the reason why she was crying, Mizuha managed to free the girl from her worries. Keiki sighed in relief as he saw this</p>
<p class="null-p">heartwarming scene, and then he heard a loud voice coming their way. "Heeeey! Miuuuuu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? Ma-kun!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miu-chan moved away from Mizuha and turned towards the voice. From that direction a boy came running who seemed to be the same age as Miu-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's Ma-kun, huh?" "Seems like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Mizuha watched over the scene. Ma-kun had short hair and was wearing loose pants with a hoodie above that. He seemed like the kind of boy who'd be really into soccer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ma-kun, why are you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was searching for you, Miu. You weren't at home, so I thought you must be off crying somewhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ma-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Miu-chan realized that he had been searching for her, she looked close to breaking out in tears again. A mix of happiness and guilt filled her expression, and Ma-kun awkwardly scratched his cheek in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About what I said just earlier… I take it back." "Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying that I'll marry you, Miu." "…Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…Though only after we've become adults. I said something I didn't mean out of embarrassment because there were other people nearby."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… do you like me, Ma-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't come all the way out here if I didn't like you, okay?" Ma-kun said, somewhat awkwardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing that, Miu-chan broke out in a blooming smile. "That… got resolved fairly quickly, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I couldn't even get any popcorn…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two high school students looked at each other with somewhat bewildered expressions. Just as Mizuha had guessed, the two of them shared mutual feelings after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good for you, Miu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! It's just like you said, Onee-san!" Miu-chan shook Mizuha's hand in gratitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ma-kun spoke up again. "Let's go home, Miu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait a second, Ma-kun!" Miu-chan stopped her childhood friend and turned towards Mizuha again.</p>
<p class="null-p">She took out something from her pouch and gave it to Mizuha. "You can have this, Onee-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a beautiful bookmark made out of purple Japanese paper. It even had a high-quality string attached to it. It was quite a stylish design.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a hot spring that my aunt manages, so I recommend you go there and check it out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She told me to give this to any newlyweds I saw in town!" "R-Really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That aunt sure knows how to do business…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She's even using an innocent child to advertise her establishment. Maybe having your establishment grow around here is difficult.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much for today!" Miu-chan politely bowed to the two and made her way towards Ma-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">After waving her hand at them one last time, she walked away while holding hands with Ma-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-By the way, who are those people?" "-Newlyweds who came from very far away." "-Hmmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki watched the two of them walk off into the distance and spoke up to Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That ended unexpectedly smoothly, didn't it?" "…Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing." Mizuha shook her head and smiled. "I'm glad they felt the same way towards each other."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like Mizuha was trying to hide something, but without knowing what it was, Keiki couldn't dig any deeper.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just now it looked like she was worried about something again…</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha in that moment made a face that resembled one Keiki had seen her making a lot recently, like she was lacking her usual energy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something must be eating at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was almost like back when that rumor was going around. Keiki didn't want her to be as sad as she was back then. However, without any knowledge of her older brother's worries, Mizuha looked down at the bookmark.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I wonder where that hot spring is that Miu-chan mentioned? It's not written on the bookmark, at least…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. I feel like that was a pretty impressive advertisement, but there's no meaning to it if they don't even tell you where it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">No trace of any hint of an address could be seen on the bookmark. "It's a mystery why they'd recommend this to newlyweds." "Maybe it's some kind of family bath?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, with no way to actually go to that location, they couldn't confirm anything. Regret over not having asked for details filled them, but Miu-chan and Ma-kun were already nowhere in sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">In the evening, Keiki and Mizuha were eating okonomiyaki near the train station. They randomly found it during their stroll, so they took a step there to satisfy their hunger. Keiki ordered pork and eggs, whereas Mizuha chose the seafood mix. They shared each other's food while talking about this and that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think we'd be eating okonomiyaki here, to be honest. It's not like this is some kind of local speciality or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But with how nice it smells, there's no way I could miss out on it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that scent really awakened my hunger, no joke."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to that, the two of them had decided to make a stop there. Then again, the taste was befitting of the alluring smell, so all was right in the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha seemed satisfied as well, and her cute smile slowly returned to her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder why she looked so dejected back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they split up from Miu-chan and Ma-kun, Mizuha made a lonely expression that wouldn't leave Keiki's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">She seems to be wearing her panties today, so I don't think she's angry with me…</p>
<p class="null-p">If that was the case, then this should have ended up being another no-panties day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe I should ask her now…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Keiki had no idea, his best bet would be to ask directly. He made up his mind and spoke up to Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Listen, Mizuha." "Yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When met with Mizuha's dubious gaze, Keiki couldn't muster up any courage. Thinking about it, Mizuha had tried to hide it already around noon that day, so even if he asked her now, she would probably either have a similar reaction or hide it entirely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That seafood yakisoba looks delicious. I was thinking of ordering that myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? You're still hungry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Keiki decided to make another order instead of asking the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's almost time to take our train home…" Mizuha said as she looked at the clock in the restaurant. "You might barely be able to make it in time… Do you want to order nonetheless?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No. It's a bit regrettable, but I don't want to miss the train."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their plans were to depart at 6pm, so they had barely one hour left. If they missed it now, they'd have to wait until late at night to catch the next one. They had plenty of fun already, so this was their time to leave. They paid for their food and left the restaurant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? It sure has gotten dark quick…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was barely past 5pm, it felt like the middle of the night. "Not to mention that it's really cold…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling the chilly air, Mizuha hugged herself. It was cold enough that you could see your own breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha was the first to realize it as she looked up at the sky. Keiki followed suit, and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Snow."</p>
<p class="null-p">From the pitch black sky came small flakes of white snow, slowly but steadily covering the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the midst of this strong snowstorm, Keiki and Mizuha hurried to the train station. Keiki went to confirm the situation at the reception, and Mizuha called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did they say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The trains are stopped. There's no change of plans for that, either." "No way…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Buses and taxis aren't available, either. What a blunder…"</p>
<p class="null-p">According to the person at the reception desk, it rarely snows around here this time of year. Since the taxis weren't equipped with winter tires, they couldn't risk taking customers, either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically… we can't get home?" "That's what it looks like, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of this unexpected snow storm, all of the public transportation had come to a screeching halt. Until this heavy snow stopped, there was no chance that Keiki and Mizuha would be able to make their way back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, they didn't have to worry about missing school tomorrow, but… "For now, we need to find a place to stay."</p>
<p class="null-p">The biggest problem that needed resolving was to find lodging. The train station would close eventually, so staying outside in this heavy snow would just make them freeze to death. With these thoughts in mind, they immediately tried to find any kind of place to stay, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">'-I'm terribly sorry, but because of the sudden snowfall, we had to give all our empty rooms to sudden customers, so we have no more rooms to offer.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">So said one employee at the inn they contacted. "Any luck, Mizuha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, all full." "Dang it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot of visitors were locked down in this small area like Keiki and Mizuha, so all nearby inns were at max capacity. They had taken enough money with them to let them stay somewhere if an emergency came up, but that wouldn't help them if they couldn't even find a place to stay.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should we do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, we should see if we can find another-Achoo!" Keiki let out a loud sneeze from the cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… I might need a tissue though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, you can have one of mine." Mizuha opened her bag and took out the pocket tissues.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm? You dropped something there." Keiki crouched down to pick up this object, only to realize that it was the bookmark that the girl had given Mizuha earlier that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was about to give it back to Mizuha when he realized that the corner was slightly peeled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Huh?" "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This bookmark has two layers… It was just folded together."</p>
<p class="null-p">Makes sense why nothing was written on it. It was supposed to be an advertisement that you could open and look at, but someone had folded the paper. When he read what was written on it, it said 'The Hot Spring Inn Kashi-sou', along with an address and phone number below.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the place Miu-chan was talking about was actually an inn."</p>
<p class="null-p">After checking the address with his phone, Keiki saw that it wasn't too far from their current location, and luckily they hadn't called there yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…" Keiki took the bet and punched in the phone number. "Ah, hello? I'm sorry, do you still have rooms open? …Yes… Yes that's correct. Ah, we're two people… Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After exchanging a few words with the other person, the call ended. "…Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They still have some space."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Thank goodness…" Mizuha sighed in relief and smiled. "It's also pretty cheap, and they offer breakfast along with your stay." "That's quite the luxury, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, but there's one problem." "What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They only have one open room." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They only have one open room…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No I heard you, I was just shocked." Mizuha explained, and confirmed one more time. "So basically…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, pretty much…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They'd have to stay in the same room tonight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">This unexpected development caused them to silently exchange glances. Although both of them had their own fair share of things to say, since the trains weren't running and the train station was going to close soon…</p>
<p class="null-p">"We should probably head there, right?" "Yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them left the train station, unable to look at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">After about twenty minutes of walking, they reached the location. Normally, they probably would have been faster, but the heavy snowfall slowed them down quite a bit. They walked through the Japanese-themed entrance, and headed to the reception desk to check-in. The person welcoming them was a woman of an unknown age, and she immediately prepared some towels when she saw Keiki and Mizuha appear, drenched from the snow. Keiki told the woman that he was the one who had called just now and put his name into the register.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are quite young, I must say. Are you two lovers, perhaps?" "Yes, although we just started dating."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Keiki confirmed it, Mizuha seemed happy as she grinned to herself. "We originally had plans to leave today, but the trains all stopped."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sounds quite troublesome indeed. I would assume that the trains will be working tomorrow again, so just relax here for tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">She offered to dry their shoes, which also ended up being dripping wet, so Keiki and Mizuha changed into slippers and were guided to their room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then please get some good rest." The woman said, and left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki and Mizuha put down their belongings and finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad we found an inn in the end." "You can say that again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Warm air was blowing down from the air conditioning unit, creating a comfortable atmosphere inside the room. Comparing it to the snowstorm outside was like comparing heaven and hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, it's crazy that we weren't able to make it home today." "Sorry. I should have checked the weather forecast better…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the mountains, so it can't be helped. Not to mention that the locals were just as surprised."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…" Keiki's chest grew warmer because of his girlfriend's kindness. "Oh no, I really want to hug you right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we take a bath first? We might catch a cold at this rate." "Oh, right."</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't the time to be flirting around. Both of them were still wet from the snow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, look at that, Nii-san! This room has an open-air bath!" "You're right. This really is luxurious despite the low cost."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was hidden by a set of curtains, so they hadn't seen it before, but there was a large bath right outside their window. It was a cypress bath, as although it was fairly small, it created a comfortable atmosphere to relax. Since it was covered by a roof, they didn't have to worry about the snow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since our bodies are cold, we should head in there together, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're right~"</p>
<p class="null-p">…Hm?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, hold on. None of that. We're not taking a bath together." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't let this odd situation lead him along. Even if they were officially dating now, the other person was still an unmarried girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you've seen me naked countless times so far, right?" "That is true."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Keiki was just causing unneeded confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'd better hurry, you know? You were sneezing back at the train station, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Urk…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were both still drenched from the snow. Even if the air conditioning unit was keeping the room warm, if they spent more time like this, it was only a matter of time until they caught a cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, let's go in together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But… a bath is pretty bad, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, we're a couple after all." Mizuha immediately broke through her older brother's resistance with a smile. "Since we're a couple, we can take a bath together, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes after that, the two were sitting in the bath. Because it was</p>
<p class="null-p">fairly small, the two were sitting a little ways away from each other, watching the snow fall. Mizuha let out a comfortable sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure is warm, right?" "That it is indeed, yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you sounding all polite now?" "No reason…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, are you nervous?" "I mean, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd be weird if Keiki wasn't conscious of Mizuha. The bath itself wasn't that big at all, and because of some argument about it being bad manners or whatever, the girl didn't even have a towel around her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're dating, so you can just look as much as you want."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that…" Keiki carefully directed his gaze towards Mizuha.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her slender shoulders, her cleavage, everything about her was alluring enough to completely obliterate any kind of restraint and reason Keiki desperately held onto.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't. This is too stimulating for me right now…</p>
<p class="null-p">If anything, how could she stay so calm about this? Keiki's heart was racing, and yet his little sister acted like this was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, yeah. Do you think the person at the reception was Miu-chan's auntie?" Mizuha spoke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess they recommend this place to newlyweds because of this open-air bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, this is perfect for newlyweds."</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a room and bath would definitely make any new couple happy. Thanks to that, Mizuha seemed to have cheered up a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to Miu-chan, we managed to stay over at such a great inn." "Yeah, she really saved us."</p>
<p class="null-p">If they hadn't met that girl, they would probably still be walking around outside, searching for a place to stay. Sometimes, random encounters are the most life-changing encounters of all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though it sucks that we couldn't go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right~? The weather up in the mountains sure changes abruptly." "I just hope we can make it back tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should we make a bouzu1 then?" "Does that work for snow, too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was probably out of its range of expertise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If the snow doesn't stop, we'll probably be stranded here for a while." "That would be quite troublesome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm more than happy that I get to sleep here together with Nii-san." "Eh?" Keiki subconsciously looked to his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">There, he met eyes with a blushing Mizuha. "Are you… nervous too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Of course. Tonight I'll be sleeping in the same room with Nii-san-the boy I like-so of course I'm conscious of you… and I'm expecting</p>
<p class="null-p">something as well…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Expecting… what exactly…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you like to… find out?" Mizuha whispered and brought her body closer towards Keiki.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the already narrow bath, that pretty much resulted in their bodies being pressed against the other. At the same time, Mizuha clung to her older brother's arm like she always did at home. However, since they were both naked, it was far more stimulating than ever before. In addition, her breasts were as large as ever… With this sensation of raw breasts on his skin, Keiki's reason was flaking apart very quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mizuha…?" "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without answering Keiki's question, Mizuha simply looked up at him. Her flushed cheeks, her eyes burning with passion, her lips waiting to be kissed, every part of that made Keiki's head spin.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Dear lord, I'll pass out for good…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki, who wanted to remain a dense main protagonist, realized just what the girl was expecting. Just as he did, Mizuha put more strength in her arm as she clung to Keiki. That only increased the pressure of her breasts-</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't anymore…! Keiki reached his limit. "I'll be getting out first!" "Ah, Nii-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki jumped out of the bath while hiding his nether regions and rushed back into the room. Behind his back, he heard Mizuha's disappointed 'Nii-san, you wuss', but he knew that she was right, so he could only apologize mentally.</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting his back to the door that leads out to the bath, Keiki let out a sigh. "It's not like I don't have any expectations, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite him wanting to wait for all the preparations, and wanting to treasure her, this situation was getting dangerous. He could not have expected such a turn of events.</p>
<p class="null-p">*</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After their bath, they changed into the supplied yukata with a brown robe on top, and went out to buy some milk only to find a surreal situation in front of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They clearly put both our futons together, huh…?" "Why did they…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the center of the room, someone who worked in the inn had prepared two futons, put together as tightly as possible. She came by earlier and said she</p>
<p class="null-p">would make everything ready for the two of them, but it went far beyond what they expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, we did say we were a couple at the reception…</p>
<p class="null-p">It would make sense for the inn side to prepare everything for a young couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since they already prepared it for us, it would feel rude to pull them apart." "You're not wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like they were sleeping in the same one. They were just going to sleep</p>
<p class="null-p">next to each other in separate ones. Keiki calmed himself down with these thoughts, when Mizuha pulled on his sleeve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, there's one thing I want to do with you before going to bed…" "Eh?! S-Something you want to do…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah… I was thinking of doing it on my own after you went to sleep, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"On your own!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd feel lonely like that, even though you're right next to me…" "Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's fine, right? We're going out, so I don't have to hold back any more, yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was only one possible conclusion to this. Basically, Keiki was being</p>
<p class="null-p">invited to experience his first time with his cute girlfriend. As proof, Mizuha had opened up the chest area of her yukata, flashing her cleavage. If that wasn't enough already, Mizuha's dampened eyes were raising Keiki's heartbeat even further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, Nii-san…" With the face of an angel, with the alluring charm of an adult, the girl voiced her request. "Take lots of embarrassing pictures of me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wat?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to take nudes of me, Nii-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, I heard you. I was just so shocked I didn't know what to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a miscalculation to say that their relationship had progressed. In the end, Mizuha was still the same old exhibitonist as ever. Only a helpless pervert would want her boyfriend to take nude pictures during their first night together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, we're staying over at an inn, you know? We're wearing yukata, too. I need to take pictures of this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why are normal pictures not good enough?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just personal preference. I want you to take pictures while I try out all sorts of things… is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Jeez, I get it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu. I love it when you spoil me, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Taking pictures is fine, but don't throw off your yukata, okay?" Taking fully nude pictures of Mizuha would break Keiki for good. "So, I can flash my cleavage or my thighs, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just do whatever you want…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was doing this for his adorable girlfriend. He'll make it through whatever perverted request she may have. With this determination in mind, he grasped the smartphone tightly with his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they took lots and lots of pictures.</p>
<p class="null-p">The photoshoot had ended, and the two of them were sitting surrounding a low table, drinking some warm tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew, it's been a while since I went all out like that." "It was pretty hardcore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We did it for an entire hour, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki had been close to breaking down several times. The girl's cleavage, her alluring thighs… he was forced to take pictures of all sorts of erotic parts of his beloved girlfriend, so he really wanted to hear some applause for not giving in midway. Just Mizuha in an average yukata was plenty dangerous enough. Completely disregarding her older brother's exhaustion, however, Mizuha seemed refreshed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just glad you were having fun." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You looked a bit down recently, so I was worried." "So… Did you plan this entire trip today for my sake?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I procured the tickets by complete chance, but I was planning on inviting you somewhere. As a change of pace, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you were worried about something, could you tell me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah." Mizuha put her cup down on the table, and started explaining. "I wasn't exactly worried about anything. There's just one more thing I needed</p>
<p class="null-p">to apologize about, besides not being able to keep our promise of going on a date."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I rejected your first confession." "Eh? But, that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had simply rejected his confession because of the bad rumor going around. However, this rejection wasn't related to her true feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This happened a while ago, but there was a girl crying in my classroom… She confessed to the boy she likes, but was rejected…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's always cheerful, and the mood maker of the class, so seeing her cry was a shock for me, and I realized just how much she liked that person…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki could see that. Although he wasn't there to witness it himself, the thought of a cheerful girl sobbing alone in the classroom was painful nonetheless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like I saw Nii-san when I was looking at that girl. I wondered if I made you feel that way as well because I rejected you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Keiki didn't respond at all was simply because that was exactly the case. When Keiki was first rejected by Mizuha, it felt like the world was going to end. He couldn't motivate himself to do anything, and he spent sleepless nights in grief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if we aren't related by blood, we're still siblings, so knowing Nii-san, you probably gave it a lot of thought before you confessed, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they were step-siblings, the world knew them as brother and sister. In order to convey his feelings that could destroy that relationship, Keiki</p>
<p class="null-p">needed a lot of determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, I was worried about the rumor, and hurt you…" "That's what you were bothered about this entire time?" "…Yeah." Mizuha lowered her gaze and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's also why she looked so sad after we split up with Miu-chan…</p>
<p class="null-p">Because the girl was crying after being rejected by the boy she liked. Seeing her like that, Mizuha was reminded of the fact that she did something similar to her older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Every time you treat me kindly, I'm filled with happiness, and also guilt. It makes me realize that I ended up hurting someone as kind as you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I wanted to at least make you happy, which is why I tried out all sorts of stuff…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's where that weird S&M roleplay from yesterday comes in, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki thought it was some weird attempt at setting the mood, but it was simply Mizuha's attempt to apologize.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, I already forgot about all of that." "Even if you don't mind, it still bothers me." "I figured."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even with the rumor, you did all of that, and yet I'm always on the receiving end…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was easy to tell Mizuha that she was wrong and to try to cheer her up.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that would most likely not be enough to make her feel totally better. After thinking about how he could make the girl in front of him smile again, Keiki came up with one idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, will you do something for me?" Keiki spoke up. "You have a request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you do it, I'll forgive you for hurting me." "What should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For now, just close your eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Is this… some kind of blindfold roleplay?" "No." Keiki had no interest in such a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's not…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you sound disappointed?" He really wished she wouldn't make such a dejected expression. "Anyway, don't open them until I say so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure…" Mizuha seemed dubious, but closed her eyes just as she was told.</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming this, Keiki started preparing. He opened up his backpack, took out the item he prepared, and kneeled down in front of the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nii-san?" The girl must have felt his presence closing in. "Not yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Okay." Keiki's adorable girlfriend nodded again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl waited in anxiety. Keiki gently took her hand and executed the last part of today's plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Mizuha's eyes shot open. She raised her hand and looked at it. On her ring finger shone a beautiful ring with a leaf motif.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Happy birthday." Keiki finally said the words he had held back all day. The 3rd of March, today, was Mizuha's 17th birthday.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sadly couldn't prepare cake because of this situation." "That's fine, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mizuha still seemed a bit bewildered, and she muttered to herself in a daze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't expect this. I thought you totally forgot since you didn't say anything all day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had planned a surprise party after getting home, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had bought a cake at the cake store near the train station, and planned to give her the ring at home. But because of the snowfall, that plan ended in failure, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"This ring is so cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I chose it because I thought it would look good on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki was glad that he at least got to give her the present. He snuck it with him just to make sure, and now he felt like patting himself on the back for the foresight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But a ring for a birthday present…?" "Mm… Well, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this… an engagement ring?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yes, I bought it with that intention in mind." Trying to hide it now would just waste their time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been thinking about it for a while now. Buying it from my allowance would just be lame, so I asked Koharu-senpai if she had some kind of part- time job I could do for a day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you were working part-time then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Using his connection to Koharu and her family's business, Keiki managed to get a part-time job fairly smoothly. It was just physical labor like carrying cardboard boxes, but it paid fairly well despite that.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/hensuki/illustrations/hensuki_vol_13_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"When did you figure out my finger size?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you sneak into my bed day after day. I have basically countless opportunities."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never realized…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Measuring the finger of a sleeping princess was a fairly simple feat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About just now. Just as you said, being rejected by you was a big shock, and I was depressed enough that I couldn't sleep at night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even more than that, right this very moment, you give back all this happiness I always wanted in my life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy that we sit closer together than before we started dating, and seeing Mizuha be jealous towards the other girls made me feel wanted as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even today, I was so happy that we got to go on this trip. Walking around the town, talking a lot-It was a blast because you were with me, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said that you weren't giving me anything in return, but that's not true. Because I love you, I'm just happy to have you by my side."</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching movies together, holding hands, kissing, even these minor things were full of bliss for Keiki. It reached the point where the initial shock of being rejected didn't matter to him at all anymore. In fact, if this happiness came about because of a few sleepless nights, then Keiki would be willing to pay that price again and again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if you still feel like you need to make up for rejecting me, then I'll just have you stay with me forever from here on out." Keiki said, and took Mizuha's hand that was wearing the ring.</p>
<p class="null-p">She responded by returning the grasp.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I definitely won't let go, so you'd better be prepared, okay?" "Right back at you. I'm not letting you go ever again."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two declared their intentions at each other, and smiled. "…Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for the present." "You're welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost like all the anxiety stored up inside of her had vanished, she smiled. Now things should be fine, Keiki thought. As they held hands, the girl brought her body closer to him and rested her head on his shoulder like a cat at peace.</p>
Short for Teru teru bouzu, a paper doll that children use to pray for no rain.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the 4th of March, a Sunday. The time was just past 8pm. Keiki and Mizuha made it home safely after the trains got back up running, and after they finished their dinner, they sat next to each other on the sofa in the living room. Today, Mizuha was wearing a knitted sweater with a skirt, and although she looked as adorable as ever, Keiki's gaze was fixated on her grinning face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha-san is grinning to herself while staring at the ring." "I'm happy, okay? It's a present from you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad you like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I definitely can't put this on for school." "It'll cause yet another ruckus, won't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday's surprise had ended in a resounding success. Mizuha's bad mood had improved drastically, and Keiki even managed to give her the ring. Ever since then, she'd pretty much been above the clouds. She'd snuggled up to Keiki as soon as they woke up at the inn, and they even held hands all the way back. This trip definitely closed the distance between them even further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, Nii-san." "Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really happy about the present, but there's one thing I'm still a bit grumpy about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? …W-What might that be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We slept in the same room the entire night, and even though you had your cute girlfriend right next to you, no moves were made at all. Why not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmmmmm!?" A weird voice escaped Keiki's throat. "M-Mizuha-san!? Where did that come from!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, we only kissed. I've been waiting every night for you to attack me, you know?" Mizuha pouted like she was angry at Keiki. "I've even invited you time and time again, but you don't even notice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that why you've been flashing your cleavage all the time as of late?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Were the flashing and the cold attitude all attempts on Mizuha's part to invite Keiki?</p>
<p class="null-p">"We even took a bath together, but you didn't do anything." "I had a reason for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you holding back because I'm your little sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't say anything because Mizuha's assumption was spot-on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be the case, yeah… I mean, I see you as a girl right now, but that doesn't mean you're suddenly not my little sister anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Treating her like a girlfriend, hugging her, holding hands, kissing her, these small things still made Keiki feel like he was being stabbed in the chest with guilt…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still call you Nii-san as well, so I know that it can't be helped, but… I don't want to be your little sister forever." Mizuha turned towards Keiki and took his hand. "I am your little sister, but I'm also your girlfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki couldn't make up his mind because he was afraid of crossing the line, and he had made Mizuha worry as a result. Yet again, Keiki was a failure of a boyfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry for making you feel anxious." Keiki apologized and took the girl's hand. "You're not the one at fault. Since we've just started dating, I didn't want you to hate me or anything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be perfectly honest, I was pretty much horny the entire night." "Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You need to realize just how adorable you are, Mizuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike her average older brother, Mizuha was a beauty above beauties. Her smile was angelic, her physique was alluring no matter where you looked, and she always smelled sweet. Of course Keiki felt excited just from being right next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When we took a bath, and when we slept next to each other, I tried to hold back the entire time."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Keiki's honest feelings, Mizuha lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Then, tell me…" After that, she looked up at Keiki and spoke up with a sweet, seducing voice. "Tell me how cute I am, tell me how much you love me… Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Keiki couldn't falter after being told this directly. He gently embraced his beloved girlfriend and kissed her. After that, he put his hands on her shoulders and carefully pushed her down to the sofa. There was no resistance, but Mizuha let out a flustered 'Ah…' in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right here…?" "You don't like it?" "I don't mind…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yeah." Mizuha nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">That gesture was too adorable. Keiki once again pressed his lips on hers. It was a passionate and long kiss, one they hadn't exchanged before. They exchanged kisses for a few moments, and after separating for a moment, Mizuha looked up at Keiki with damp eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san…" "Mizuha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon seeing the girl's passionate gaze, Keiki's body started to burn up as well. The girl he loved shared his feelings of affection. Just that fact alone made Keiki so happy, so blinded with love, there was no way he could hold back. He wanted everything the girl had to offer-so he put his hand on the girl's chest. Right when he felt her soft breasts even through the sweater, the girl suddenly raised a panicked voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah!? Nii-san, wait a second…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, was that too much? Was I being too forceful?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not it. I don't hate it when you're being forceful, I really don't, but this is just…!" Mizuha looked away from Keiki, to her side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Keiki traced after the girl's gaze, and… "…Eh?" He froze up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpected to both of them, in this living room that should only be inhabited by the siblings-stood two other people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh… um… are we in the way by any chance?" "Oh my, doing it on the sofa? How bold~" "Mom!? Dad!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing there were their parents, both of them wearing coats. The middle- aged man with an average body and stature was the father of this family, Kiryuu Makoto. The woman going 'Ara ara' with semi-long hair was his wife Youko.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since my vacation from work overlapped with your mother's, we decided to come home together, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems like we got in your way instead~" "………"</p>
<p class="null-p">This sudden development was too much for Keiki to handle. His brain just turned blank. After all, his right hand was still placed on Mizuha's chest. Being seen during the decisive moment where he was about to deepen his love with his little sister, not to mention by their own parents, was the beginning of the greatest battlefield in his young life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of awful timing is this…?"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">*This afterword contains spoilers, so reader discretion is advised.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you very much for picking up [Kawaikereba Hentai demo Suki ni Natte Kuremasu ka?] volume 13. As always, the cover illustration is just marvelous. Mizuha is undoubtedly adorable, and the title logo is a sight to behold. This time around turned out to be Mizuha's volume, which is why we redesigned the volume 4 cover thanks to the dear Designer-san helping us. I personally liked the volume 4 cover, so this was a welcome surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of surprises, the Hensuki series just passed 1 million copies in circulation. I never thought the wheel of perverts would spread this far. You have my eternal gratitude. Really, thank you very much for all this support. As a celebration of this milestone, we have planned an ASMR stream, an illustration collection, and special Hensuki goods. Even as the author myself, I'm very much excited to listen in on the voice recordings, or get a look at the illustration collection. You will most likely find out more details about these things before the next release, so please be on the lookout for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, with this volume, Keiki and Mizuha have finally started dating. After a lot of misunderstandings, the two are finally allowed to be connected, and even so another problem still remains. How did you like it?</p>
<p class="null-p">This perverted romcom that started with panties and a love letter will finally come to an end in the next volume. After a lot of hardships, we ask ourselves the question as to how their future lives will turn out… I'll be putting a lot of effort into the episodes after Keiki and Mizuha started dating, so I hope you'll stick around for a little longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, let us meet in the 14th volume.</p>
