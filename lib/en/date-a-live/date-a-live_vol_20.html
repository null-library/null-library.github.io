<p class="null-h1">Prologue: Another Spirit</p>
<p class="null-p">If Takamiya Mio were told to describe the events that had a pronounced lasting impression on her life time, then most of them were‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Good or bad‐there was no difference of it being filled with stories about Takamiya Shinji. The day when she first meet Shinji.</p>
<p class="null-p">The day when she was taken to the ocean by Shinji</p>
<p class="null-p">The day when Shinji died right before her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like the roots of a large tree, or possibly a sharpened lynchpin, it was deeply craved into Mio's</p>
<p class="null-p">memories, becoming the driving force pushing her towards the path of ruin and salvation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything was for Shinji's sake. All in order for her to regain that most glimmering time with Shinji. With those thoughts in mind, Mio fought through a long period of thirty years alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">But there were exceptions in all things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with her memories of Shinji colored by joy and sadness, there were several other events that remained strong within her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, her encounter with Tokisaki Kurumi. For example, her memories as Murasame Reine. And also‐</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened around the time Mio had produced a few Sephira Crystals.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sephira Spirit Crystals. The devilish gemstone that transformed humans into Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mio, for the sake of her goal, divided her power to create them, turning humans into Spirits one by one.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the Sephira was not originally compatible with human attributes. A human being who was given a freshly made Sephira would not be able to control that power and run rampant. In order to create a perfect Spirit, it was necessary to use several human bodies to purify the Sephira.</p>
<p class="null-p">But one day, Mio had thought. If she could skip that stage, it would save time and above all there will be no unnecessary sacrifices‐then.</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day, Mio produced a Sephira Crystal in a slightly different way than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Form."</p>
<p class="null-p">While quietly saying that, she sharpened her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">She split and condensed a portion of the reiryoku overflowing from her own body. At that time, she concentrated and separated the socalled "poison" that could harm humans, into a place inside Sephira.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without using humans as filters, can it be possible to create refined Sephira from the beginning? "‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to bring life to the product just created, she blew to it. Immediately, the Sephira began to faintly shake and glow.</p>
<p class="null-p">This ritual-like process was the final step in determining the attributes of the Sephira Crystal. She consolidated this power into a single mass through the image of bestowing a portion of her emotions. While doing so, the Sephira would change into various different colors</p>
<p class="null-p">If she put in wrath, it would be a fierce red.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she put in sorrow, it would be depressed blue.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she put in regret‐it would be a deep bottomless black.</p>
<p class="null-p">Experience had shown that it was easier for the Sephira Crystal to exert a strong power if negative emotions were included. However, at the same time, then the number of people sacrificed for the refining process would also increase.</p>
<p class="null-p">So this time, Mio put in a warm, but intense emotion, onto the Sephira Crystal.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of Mio's motivation‐the emotion scorching this body: love.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐ "……Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mio widened her eyes, raising her voice in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Sephira, she had just created in her hand, suddenly started pulsating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Sephira is……? What is this‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mio grew worried, the heartbeat of the Sephira grew stronger and stronger‐before long flying away from Mio's hand and floating in the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in the middle of that space, the Sephira gave off a tremendous light, its silhouette swelled rapidly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The intense light blinded her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when she opened her eyes‐a young girl had appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">The long hair in the shade of the night flew by the wind. Looming behind her hair was a cold white porcelain face.</p>
<p class="null-p">A beautiful girl, who exuded a violent expression, was wearing a bluish purple Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐You, are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though Mio asked in surprise, the girl did not respond, she looked down at her palm, opening and closing her hand several times as if to confirm its feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when looking around to observe the situation‐finally, she looked towards Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…. Who the hell, are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At those words, Mio involuntarily held her breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was impossible to imagine, this girl has her own will.</p>
<p class="null-p">An irregular beyond anticipation. In the blink of eye, Mio's mind filled with thoughts. Who is she? What to do with her? Is it possible to use dialogue to make her an ally? However, the constant thing was that this was an existence that could drastically alter the plans. In order to achieve the greatest goal of turning Shinji into a Spirit, should she get rid of things that could upset the plan?</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, think later. First of all, let's get the Sephira back from her‐ "‐Wha..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, from there, Mio choked.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the moment Mio came to a conclusion and intended to bind her, the expression of the girl standing in front of her eyes changed. It was as if she was reflecting Mio's own hostility.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, her figure did not change at all. However, the color of the burning light in those eyes was clearly different.</p>
<p class="null-p">What in the world was this‐? "Nahemah" For a moment, when the girl whispered like that, the darkness gathered behind her, forming a giant throne.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the girl gently stomped on the armrest and flew up, from behind the throne she pulled out a sword‐</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, she aimed a slash towards Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Amazing sword skills. Her attack caused shockwaves to rush towards Mio. Mio sharpened her gaze, canceling that attack just as it was about to reach her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..What are you suddenly doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humph‐That's my line. Don't hide your hostility."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl shouted while screaming. Once again she swung her sword, slashing continuously towards Mio. The dense reiryoku traced from the trajectory of the sword teared though the space around Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mio dealt with those attacks, while eliminating them, she opened her mouth softly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Ain Soph'."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she called that name, with Mio as the epicenter, the space turned monochrome‐suppressing the body of the Spirit that had just been born from the Sephira.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although only looking at the amount of reiryoku that was cornered into an attack, Mio knew she was an extremely powerful Spirit. However, no matter how powerful the Spirit was, it is impossible to resist the Angel of law 'Ain Soph'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit groaned in pain, releasing reiryoku from her body as if trying to escape from the restraint.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, at the next moment, strips of light extended from Mio's Astral Dress, piercing her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bastard."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit said that while glaring viciously at Mio, then her body turned into particles of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds, at the place where she stood was a glittering Sephira surrounded by strips of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm surprised. For the first time, something like this happened." Mio murmured to herself, recovering the strips of light to pull the Sephira to her side. And, she put Sephira in her hand, looking down at it.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she clenched her fist and gathered reiryoku, this Sephira would break without a trace. Removing a dangerous factor, the irregular will no longer exist. If considering the plan, it is definitely the right choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Mio didn't break the Sephira.</p>
<p class="null-p">Creating Sephira requires a huge amount of reiryoku; Mio cannot create them continuously anyway. Moreover, she had a hesitation when idly erasing a rare Spirit that just happened to appear. "No‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Contemplating it, Mio lightly shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have been trying to find a reason in her head‐after all; the most obvious reason didn't change.</p>
<p class="null-p">Born from the Sephira Crystal‐it could be called a pure Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Mio couldn't mercilessly kill an existence like herself. "….Welcome, my daughter.‐to this worst world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mio said as if whispering, caressing the Sephira lovingly.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Fragmentary Chapter 1: The Other Me</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened her eyes in the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, she didn't even know if the description of being in the dark was appropriate. Since she couldn't even judge what was going on here.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an incomprehensible space where everything was ambiguous, where everything was vague. There was the feeling of drifting in lukewarm water. If even a little lax, the existence surrounding her body would begin to melt away from her fingertips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, a single thought flashed through her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">What in the world am I?</p>
<p class="null-p">She asked herself indifferently. A question that wouldn't be answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing she remembered was the appearance of the woman who created her. But she was anyhow at a loss understanding why she was born. Likewise‐she didn't know how she existed.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was nothing that could be used to define her own existence. Just like a boat with its cable loosened, she just drifted on aimlessly. One day, these unsolvable questions would surely be washed away by the waves of boredom and fatigue, fading away into dust.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, located inside this ()</p>
<p class="null-p">At some point, she discovered "something" there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It" was someone's heart and emotions. Someone's personality that had a clear will.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the moment of touching it, she understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">This heart belonged to a girl that could be called another version of herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't know why she understood this. But, this matter became a "fact" that didn't even need to be determined to gain the conviction to reign over her thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Another version of herself inside her heart. What a strange feeling this was. Was this the sensation of people undergoing multiple personality disorder? No‐for her, it would be perhaps better to say that her body was taken away by this other personality that grew up while she was sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, very unexpectedly, she didn't come to hate this other self.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, she was glad to know that there was something else other than herself in this space where</p>
<p class="null-p">nothing existed. She couldn't see anything. She couldn't hear anything. But when she touched that heart, she could somehow feel that other self's emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having said that‐those feelings weren't necessarily always good. At the beginning, there was confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, there was pain, fear, sadness, suspicion‐ The other me always experienced such negative emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Hu, mans)</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words were transmitted from her other self's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">To cause her other self be frightened, she called out the name of the people who made her sad as her chest incised with a quiet anger.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: The World of Happiness</p>
<p class="null-p">Dozing off is similar to death. Both cases, the consciousness falls into the dark. The difference is whether waking comes after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, did the awakening of the consciousness correspond to resuscitation or rebirth‐while thinking over such a shameless topic, Itsuka Shidou slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't the ceiling, but a white ridgeline that first came into view.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds later,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou noticed it was a blanket. Apparently, he had been sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Accompanied by a snore of laziness, Shidou turned over his body before standing up.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the room he was familiar with. It was the same unchangeable morning as usual. Warm sunshine was coming through the window, but the air was still a bit cool.</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking of this, Shidou slanted his head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What day is it today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if in a state of being half-asleep, he couldn't remember the date at all. No, to precise, it was not only the day that was left vague, but the month as well. Shidou could only judge the approximate season from the temperature felt on his skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Shidou himself had no experience, it was probably close to the feeling of a morning hangover. His condition before going to bed couldn't be clearly recalled. Although it should have been the usual morning, a strange hazy feeling of something being out of place had wrapped around his mind. It was like an anxious feeling of having nothing to rely on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, whatever."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was strange, but he couldn't think up an answer. Shidou decided to cross-check everything for the time being as he walked out the room while scratching his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">After walking down the stairs and through the corridor, Shidou heard the sound of the TV coming from the living room. It seemed that Kotori had gotten up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Kotori. ……Hey, what day is it today‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the door to the living room was opened, Shidou's words came to a halt.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. It was because there was an unexpected face in the living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of them was Kotori. That wasn't the issue. She was his cute little sister with black ribbons on her head. Right now, she was sitting on the sofa facing the TV with her favorite Chupa Chups in tow.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was next to her. A girl was sitting next to Kotori, stretching her back beautifully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her light colored hair was tied around her neck. Her correct posture and manner was as if mechanical. The radiance exuded from her pair of eyes was like the light source of an electronic screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ma……ria?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou rounded his eyes staring, he called out the name that came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That figure was unmistakably that of Maria, the management AI of the airship 'Fraxinus'. "Yes. Good morning, Shidou‐you still have bed hair on your bangs. Are you still asleep?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? A-aah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a vague reply, Shidou brushed his bangs with his finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, just as Maria had said, his bangs were leaping out sideways.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, right now there was something Shidou cared about more than the bangs on his head. Of course, this matter was Maria sitting on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria is the management AI of 'Fraxinus'. Although through a previous major modification it was possible to communicate via voice, at best it would be only a personality existing in a computer.</p>
<p class="null-p">So how was Shidou able to distinguish her as Maria without any pause‐? "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time as realizing that, along with a slight headache, a memory appeared within Shidou's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the memory of that battle. Isaac Westcott, who had gained the power of the Spirit of Origin through the Spirit Ceremony, and the Spirits that fought against him. In the process,</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria was able to gain physical form through the power of Nia's Angel 'Rasiel'. He</p>
<p class="null-p">remembered it being said that……after maintaining the state of controlling the output of power, Maria can remain materialized like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right. Why did he forget this beforehand?</p>
<p class="null-p">Forgetting about that fierce battle. Forgetting how everyone won together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Forgetting about the Spirit that sacrificed herself to save Shidou and the others‐Mio. Mio. Takamiya Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the source for everything, the Spirit of Origin‐as well as Analytic Officer of</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ratatoskr' Murasame Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Shidou's‐no, Takamiya Shinji's‐beloved person. Although it was only temporary, he had forgotten even her‐ "What's up Shidou? Haven't you woken up yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou silently placed his hand against his forehead. Likely suspicious of that, Kotori had asked that while slanting her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……I'm fine. Say, Kotori, what month and day is it today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gently shook his head as he reissued again the question he had stopped midway asking earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah……? You must still be sleeping. Today is March 19th."</p>
<p class="null-p">"March‐19th."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou pondered over this date several times in his mind. March 19th, from the day of the date between Shidou and Reine‐the date of the decisive battle‐nearly an entire month had passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time as noticing this, as if being pulled along a sweet potato vine, his memory began resurfacing one after the other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and the others had triumphed. But at that moment, Mio and Westcott both died in a mutual kill.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after everything was over Mio's Sephira Crystal, which came down in front of Shidou along with the stuffed bear, finished its role and disappeared into the air. He could clearly recall the memories that had been hazy until now. That's right. After that, everyone had lost Mio‐the sadness of losing Reine, and returned back to a peaceful daily life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……that's true……everything‐is over."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou absentmindedly spilled out those words, Kotori widened her eyes before averting her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she quickly sighed and stood up from the sofa, and then she gently embraced Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm sorry. I was insensitive ‐it's been a little while since that decisive battle. You don't have to force yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kotori tightened the grip around her hands. "Kotori……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt a faint tremble in Kotori's arms as she bit into her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori would likely never admit this, but those words were likely to be directed towards herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Murasame Reine was Kotori's most trusted subordinate and closest friend. She was exposed as</p>
<p class="null-p">'Phantom'‐and then disappeared. Even though Kotori had to display a composed demeanor in front of everyone, it was impossible for her to not be affected by this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having said that, before that war, Shidou had already decided‐he would tightly hug Kotori after everything was over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the order had been reversed, it didn't matter. Shidou reached out his hands to hug Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori let out a little surprised voice. However, she didn't struggle and try to leave his hands. The two of them held their bodies close to each other for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm, I see. So that's how you initiative a natural embrace, as expected of Kotori. I've learned it now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking on at such a scene, Maria spoke with interest as she took out a notebook to begin writing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, Kotori's face flushed red as she rushed over to grab the notebook from Maria.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what are you taking notes of, Maria!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. This nothing more than my means of collecting information‐Kotori's wiles and maneuvers has already been preserved in the form of images for further review later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That isn't reassuring at all! Delete it for me immediately, immediately!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even the commander cannot arbitrarily delete records that are kept in the most important database. This requires two crew members below the deputy commander and the permission from the Round Table. Doesn't it matter that these images will have to be made public?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would that be regarded as important information!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori gave a loud scream, Maria used her calm expression to feign innocence. Seeing their</p>
<p class="null-p">interaction, Shidou couldn't help but laugh. "‐Haha, ha."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! W-what are you laughing at!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said discontentedly as her face was red as a rose. Shidou replied back with a "sorry, sorry" while shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, have you eaten breakfast yet? I'll make it right now‐speaking of which, can Maria also eat?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, no problem. This body can do almost anything that humans can do. It feels comfortable to</p>
<p class="null-p">hug as well. Soft and fluffy. Do you want to try it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Maria spread out her hands. Shidou made an ambiguous smile while scratching his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……maybe another time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……is that so. It seems the correct answer for a hug is to not speak of it or direct the necessity of it like in the case of Kotori. ‐Database registration. Category method of falling in love: Kotoristyle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, you can log into the database without any authorization!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Kotori grabbed Maria's shoulders. Shidou smiled while looking on at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he washed his face and changed his clothes to begin the preparations for breakfast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Then, I wish you a pleasant journey, Kotori, Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">After breakfast, Maria waved farewell to Shidou and Kotori, whom had both finished their preparations. Shidou returned the gesture as the tips of his shoes touched the front of the entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, then we'll be heading out. I'll go do some shopping on the way back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. ‐But it is vexing to just see Shidou and the others off after finally obtaining a long-</p>
<p class="null-p">awaited real body. When the time is right, I'll make the transfer to high school next month."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Maria, you are 'Ratatoskr's AI. Luckily, the materialization wasn't a heavy burden on Nia, but wouldn't it be troublesome if you don't take your work seriously? Since the reiryoku of the Spirits is still there, there is the danger of that power running rampant even though the possibility isn't high."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria twirled her fingertips as Kotori narrowed her eyes with some dissatisfaction in her tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, will you please not underestimate my handling ability? The high school level of curriculum is trivial to me. I can take the first year entrance exams even while doing the regular tasks. But in order to reach the top, it was necessary to invite out Origami with someone named Shidou on the day of the test."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to say that with great fanfare! Your intentions are obvious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori shouted, Maria shrugged her shoulders and lowered her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's fine. I'm content with this status quo for the time being. It's not bad to send Shidou out of the house with the feeling of a newlywed wife."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Maria said that, she disappeared into the kitchen as if coming up with something.</p>
<p class="null-p">And ten seconds later, she returned this time wearing a pretty apron. As she said, the look resembled that of a newlywed wife.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me say it again, I wish you two will have a pleasant journey."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……then, we'll be heading out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou forced a smile towards a discontent Kotori as he opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment, along with the soft sunshine of early spring, a buzzing sound was heard coming from the front gate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking closely, many Spirits had gathered in front of the Itsuka residence. Kaguya, Yuzuru, Yoshino, Natsumi, and Mukuro, all of whom lived in the Spirit mansion next to the Itsuka residence. And for some reason the appearance of Miku, who should have lived in her own home in the city, could also be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's so lively today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what are you guys doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou asked while puzzled. As everyone's attention was drawn to that question‐Miku seized that opportunity to capture Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi-san, caught you! Kunkunkun! Su~unsunsunsunsun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gya‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking advantage of her leverage of Natsumi's petite body, Miku buried her face against</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's head, squirming as if to smell her scent.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few seconds later, Miku complexion looked glossy while Natsumi looked exhausted as if all of her vitality had been sucked dry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Darling! And also Kotori-san and Maria-san as well! Good morning~. Today is so beautiful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"G-good morning……so what is going on here? Miku, isn't your school not in this direction……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm off school today for work. But today's task seems very difficult, so I felt like</p>
<p class="null-p">replenishing a bit of energy from everyone before heading to the scene."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Miku spoke, she assumed a lovely pose. It was with a style worthy having come from a top idol.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……how come, was that really the reason?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shudder. From your sudden attack, I thought it was a zombie coming to bite us."</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Miku's explanation, the Yamai sisters Kaguya and Yuzuru, dressed in the same uniform, both wiped their sweat from their foreheads.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly "receiving energy" was generally an expression used for the act of receiving</p>
<p class="null-p">encouragement. But with Miku's application, this turned into a direct energy drain attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-are you okay, Natsumi-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……bestir oneself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……W-why is it always me……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the joint intervention of Yoshino and Mukuro, Natsumi was able to escape from Miku's clutches.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Miku replied while raising three of her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are roughly three reasons why I chose Natsumi-san! First, it is because Natsumi-san is very cute! Second, it's because Natsumisan smells very good! Third, because Natsumi-san is slower than the others, she's easier to catch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's mainly the third reason‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi screamed while standing up to her feet. Because of the energy taken from Natsumi,</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku revealed a cute "hehe ★" idol smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That must be exhausting……Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I've already gotten used to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou spoke with a wry smile, Natsumi sighed as if having given up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that being said, why are Natsumi and the others here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……we were just about to head out. Because of Kotori's foul schemes, I'll have to go to junior high next month, so I have to buy the necessary supplies……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi muttered, Kotori narrowed her eyes and retaliated back as soon as she heard that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you calling foul? ‐although 'Ratatoskr' is readily available to make preparations,</p>
<p class="null-p">isn't it more fun to go shop at the stationary store with your friends?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right? Kotori raised her head to seek approval from the other two. Both Yoshino and Mukuro nodded in turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……I'm looking forward to buying something with Natsumi-san and Mukuro-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. The same is true for Muku. It is still more interesting to go shopping together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……u……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to Yoshino and Mukuro's replies, Natsumi shut up as her cheeks turned slightly red. It seemed she was bashful in showing approval, but also didn't show any opposition either. It was better to say that she looked quite happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps moved by the scene in front of her eyes, Miku staggered as if struck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……what a dazzling scene……it feels like my heart is being washed. ‐Hello, manager? Please cancel my work for today. …..Eh, no I am not feeling uncomfortable. It better to say that after being supplemented with energy, I'm so full of ample vitality that I want to go shopping for stationary with everyone else! ……No, no, between recording the program song and finding matching pens, the side that which is more important is self-evident!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi quickly grabbed Miku's phone and said, "I'm very sorry, yes, she'll go to work……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah! Natsumi-san is no fun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku frowned as she twisted her body. In order to admonish her, Yoshino and Mukuro both shook their heads.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't Miku-san……you'll inconvenience the staff like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, if you want a matching pen, we'll buy it for you. So fulfill your duty properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Nuu‐it's a shame I can't participate directly, but I'll endure it for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku smiled as her eyes sparkled. Seeing this, Natsumi let out a heavy sigh as she handed back to the smartphone to Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment as if to match that timing, the sounds of a light horn popped up from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oops……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that noise due to everyone blocking the traffic……Shidou considered that as he quickly turned his body around. The rest of the Spirits also turned to that direction after following his lead.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, shortly afterwards everyone was stunned.</p>
<p class="null-p">As most of them had expected, there was a round moped parked there‐but it was the familiar face riding it that Shidou and the others recognized.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nia!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yahho‐why has everyone gathered together this early in the morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lifting the googles on her helmet, Honjou Nia waved her hand. She was also among one of the Spirits that had her power sealed by Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, we have to go to school and some are going shopping……but why are you here Nia?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's good that my work is finally over, but I have no food left at home. ……Convenience store bentos have no taste, but if I come to the Spirit mansion a warm meal will be ready……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……having said that, so you can ride a motorbike."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Shidou turned to look at the moped Nia was riding. Nia responded back with an "Ahaha" laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I am respectable Onee-san after all. As far as it goes now, can anyone else here also</p>
<p class="null-p">drive? Maybe next time I should take everyone out for a drive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia replied with a wink. Unlike Yoshino, Miku, the Yamai sisters, and Mukuro who were all excited, Kotori and Natsumi casted a suspicious gaze at Nia as if saying "……is it really no problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to agree with that suspicion, Maria came out wearing an apron to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐On the standpoint of guarding everyone's safety, I don't recommend it very much. After all, do you even have a driver's license, Nia?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? How rude, of course I do! Look!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Nia took out her driver's license from her wallet. While it should be expected, even Nia carried her driver's license on her person. Incidentally, her eyes were squinting in the photo. "Hmm. So have you renewed your driver's license?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Maria pointed that out, Nia's eyes turned into two blank dots.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Nia, you should have been kidnapped by DEM for the last five years. During that time, shouldn't your license have expired?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia looked at the driver license in her hands for a while, remaining speechless‐ "…………Tehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she adorably stuck out her tongue to take back what she just said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-hey, Nia! What kind of respectful adult tries to drive without a license!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Danger. How really contemptable……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, don't blame me for this!? After all my sense of time has been blurred……this is all due DEM's harm!? This isn't my fault!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia shouted with tears in her eyes. In order to console her, Kotori sighed while spreading out her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that this is DEM's fault, but the police wouldn't care about that. Before you get arrested, get your driver's license renewed. ‐If you want to eat, move the moped to the side of the apartment or push it back yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Nia made a regrettable face, it couldn't be helped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou bitterly smiled while watched this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……but it's such a strange coincidence. Everyone has unexpectedly gathered here at this</p>
<p class="null-p">time. ……Or are Origami and Kurumi also nearby?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐You called for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Did you say my name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiya…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly hearing those voices coming from behind him caused Shidou to unintentionally jump up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking back closely, he could see there were a girl with a doll-like face and a girl with long bangs covering her left eye. ‐They were the Spirits he had just mentioned, Tobiichi Origami and Tokisaki Kurumi. Both of them wore coats over their school uniforms and scarfs around their necks,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, Kurumi, when were you here……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've always been here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just passing by. It was so lively here that I wanted to see what had happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he was worried about what Origami meant by "always", he felt he shouldn't ask more.</p>
<p class="null-p">While twitching, Shidou wiped away the sweat pouring from his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Shidou slanted his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Kurumi, that uniform that you're wearing……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara, really Shidou-san. Did you forget? After that battle, I went under 'Ratatoskr's protection and started attending school again, isn't that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……ah, yes……that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to her say it like that, Shidou began to recall that it had occurred like that. ……It</p>
<p class="null-p">seemed that he was really exhausted. Shidou carelessly scratched his face</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true. Please cheer up a little.‐Ah, please forgive me, I must head on first. A friend is waiting for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Friend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widened his eyes at the unexpected words. Before sealing her reiryoku, Kurumi was considered the Worst Spirit; he thought the words just didn't suit her very well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kurumi didn't notice this, turning her gaze forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked like he was dragged along, looking at the same side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately, an elegant-looking girl was standing there, as if she noticed Shidou's gaze, she bowed. Shidou reflexively bowed too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is … Kurumi's friend? I mean …..what a surprisingly wonderful thing to imagine..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi half-closed her eyes while looking at his face. Shidou made a gesture like saying "Oops" before covering his mouth with his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, looking at Shidou like that, Kurumi smiled satisfied, turning around and waving her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, that's fine. I think so too."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said it like she was joking, and then walked towards her friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Sorry for let you waiting, Sawa-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no. Moreover, is it okay? Don't you want to go with him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, don't worry about it.‐Even without having me, there's still a lot of beauties around Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara…..that's true."</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that, Kurumi talked to her friend very happily. Shidou sighed, but when he looked at Kurumi's peaceful face, he could feel the warmth spreading in his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, after looking on at this scene, the mouth of the Yoshinon puppet on Yoshino's left hand began move.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but this coincidence is really amazing. Everyone has gathered together so early in the morning. Shidou-kun, are you spreading out some strange pheromones?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's impossible……"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the accusation that flew across, Shidou couldn't help but force a smile. Having said</p>
<p class="null-p">that……what Yoshinon had said wasn't unreasonable. So far, everyone has not gathered together like today. There was the feeling as if they had assembled under the guidance of someone‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Nia seemed to recognize something as she looked around at everyone's faces before speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said that everyone is present……but isn't there someone missing? Did she go on ahead first?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing that, Shidou also surveyed around everyone's faces just like Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">A large number of Spirits had gathered around the road in front of the Itsuka residence. Kotori, Yoshino, Natsumi, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Mukuro, Miku, Nia, Origami, Kurumi, and also Maria and Kurumi's friend Sawa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite so many people here, there was still the feeling of one person missing.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right; there was one person who wasn't here‐ "‐Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, a cheerful voice was heard coming from the entrance of the mansion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the influence of that voice, Shidou suddenly jerked his head back. There, he saw a single girl running over here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Long hair in the color of the night that gently swayed while illuminated by the sunshine, glittering crystal like eyes, from her overtly refined facial features the most defining was her innocent smile that radiated a sense of compassion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. ‐She was the Spirit · Yatogami Tohka. The Spirit who was given her name by Shido. "Toh, ka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu! Sorry Shidou, I guess I'm a little late……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the moment Tohka approached in front of him, there was an unfathomable feeling causing his eyes to open widely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Shidou, does it hurt somewhere?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh? Ah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just while listening to her, Shidou noticed‐tears were falling down from his own eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing……haha, maybe I'm just still sleepy." While trying to cover it up, he wiped away the tears. In fact, Shidou didn't understand what was going on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why‐why did his heart tightened when he saw Tohka?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Compared to that……let's head to school. We'll be late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, that's right! Everyone has already waited for so long. Let's go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone nodded in agreement to Tohka's voice‐as they each set foot for their respective destinations.</p>
<p class="null-p">The skies seemed clear just like everyone's future. The footsteps in route to school were so light that he surprised even himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were many sad things. There was also a painful farewell that he couldn't forget.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even when taking that into consideration, Shidou's life had been full of wonderful encounters.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, these noisy but enjoyable days will continue from now on as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">While watching everyone's smiles, Shidou secretly thought about that to himself.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">One evening several days from then. After a lively dinner, everyone headed home.</p>
<p class="null-p">After tidying up, Shidou removed his apron and placed it on the kitchen table so that he could lightly stretch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slight fatigue, but an even greater sense of fulfillment filled his body. Shidou didn't dislike this feeling. While washing the dishes that the Spirits had eaten clean, a mischievous thought passed through his mind. What sort of dishes should he surprise everyone for next time?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Shidou fell silent while looking on at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no complaints about his current life. DEM was being wellbehaved, and his current routine with the Spirits was raucous but pleasing. He felt grateful from the bottom of his heart that these days could continue on like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">But when finishing the housework, when there was no one else to talk to‐moments where he was alone with nothing to do, an unexpected feeling of unease passed through his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The feeling……of having forgotten something……"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the door to the living room was pushed open, as Kotori entered with rolled up sleeves and white ribbons in tow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onii-chan, the bath is free."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori spoke with a smile. When wearing black ribbons, she was a fierce and dependable commander. But when wearing the white ribbons, she became a cute little sister that acted her age.</p>
<p class="null-p">The smile from his little sister caused the feeling of unease passing through his mind disappear. Shidou returned the smile to Kotori as his hand reached for the door of the refrigerator.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh. Thanks, Kotori. ‐Ah, I want a hot cup of milk, does Kotori want some as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh‐! I want to drink!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I really can't thank you enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori made an exaggerated nod as her eyes were sparkling. Inconceivably, her twintails also appeared to be lively stirring in excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slanted his head. The Spirits had returned home and Maria had gone back to 'Fraxinus'</p>
<p class="null-p">for work, but Shidou had clearly heard another voice that didn't belong to Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking for the direction of that voice, it turned out that there was a small girl sitting on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hair tied in a single ponytail and a birthmark mole under her left eye, the girl's features would cause others to remark a passing resemble to Shidou's own.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was no wonder that was the case. She was Shidou‐in actuality Shinji's true younger sister, Takamiya Mana.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mana, when did you!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oya, I just came normally through the front entrance, you didn't notice?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Mana helplessly shrugged her shoulders. Apparently, she had arrived while Shidou was cleaning the dishes……he didn't know if he was too focused on scrubbing away the stains or if Mana could erase the traces of her footsteps.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, despite being surprised at Mana's sudden appearance, Mana's visit itself should be very welcomed. Shidou shrugged his shoulders with a wry smile as he set aside portions of milk enough for three people into a small heated pot.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few minutes, after carefully watching the steam rising from the white surface of the milk, he poured it into the prepared mugs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've kept you waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much. Itadakimasu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and Mana both breathed out a "fuha" sigh at the same time after drinking a sip of the warm milk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because their movements were perfectly in sync, Shidou smiled unintentionally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? What's wrong, Nii-sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, no. It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">After brushing that aside in a casual tone, Shidou took a sip of the warm milk. The warm sweetness spread across his mouth as the gentle heat flowed down his throat and into his stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if remembering something, Kotori twitched her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mana, since you've come here, is the inspection over? How are the results?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As that matter was brought up, Shidou also turned his gaze over to Mana just like Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Mana was now a member of 'Ratatoskr', she was originally captured by DEM and given the tremendous power to become a Wizard through the maryoku treatment.</p>
<p class="null-p">But achieving such power was not possible without great cost. Although it couldn't be seen from her appearance, Mana's lifespan only had about 10 years left.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and Shidou didn't want Mana to fight again, but in the previous battle they still needed to resort to using her power. As a result, at the end of the battle, they had doubled down on the Mana's meticulous treatment and inspection.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, that's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana narrowed her eyes in response to Kotori's question as she placed her hand against her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Had a serious problem been discovered? The brief silence caused Shidou's nerves to feel tense.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's incredible……all of the problems have been cured."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cured……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, hearing the unexpected words that Mana said, Shidou and Kotori both stared while stunned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what happened? You said that you're cured……what does that mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is to say Mana's body. The damage brought by DEM's lies has disappeared without a trace. It's still a hypothesis, but the reika emitted from when Mio-san's Sephira Crystal might have something to do with it. I was told that if mindful of my health, it wouldn't be a dream anymore</p>
<p class="null-p">to be able to enjoy living to an old age."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-is, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou instinctively raised his brow at the suspicious clean sheet of health declaration.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the sake of an explanation, Shidou looked on to Kotori, who placed her hand against her chin,</p>
<p class="null-p">mumbling out an "hmm……" before saying "I don't understand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But since the instruments onboard 'Fraxinus' had given those results, there shouldn't be any</p>
<p class="null-p">mistakes in Mana's physical condition. Although there is room to further investigate the cause ……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it wasn't fully accepted, but if it was really true it would be gratifying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched the handle of the mug as he raised it in a celebratory toast.</p>
<p class="null-p">After understanding Shidou's intentions, Kotori and Mana also raised their mugs. Shidou and the others smiled at each other while lightly drinking to the toast. "Somehow, I feel that everything is going to well…..although isn't that good thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. DEM is on the verge of collapse and all of the Spirits are very happy! Even the issue of Mana's physical condition has been cured!</p>
<p class="null-p">Being dissatisfied at this level would merit divine punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That right, Nii-sama. No, with this Mana needs to plan out her future a little more. I had thought my life would pass by in a flash, but it seems that won't be the case anymore. ‐Say Kotori-san, can I transfer into your junior high at the same time as Yoshino-san? If I'm going to keep living from now on, it's a bit too much to say that my final education was primary school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh! Of course. Will my school do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that manner, Kotori and Mana began happily discussing plans for the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this scene, Shidou couldn't help but feel at ease. However‐at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Do you really think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, after he heard an unknown voice coming from somewhere, Shidou's shoulders began to shiver.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't just Shidou who displayed that response. Kotori had the same startled response as</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, while Mana raised her vigilance as she didn't dare to look away even for a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Mana who first noticed the true nature of that voice. Her eyes revealed a look of disgust as she snorted softly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐What are you doing 'Nightmare'. No……Tokisaki Kurumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara. Mana-san is addressing me by my name. Will the sun rise from the west tomorrow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time that voice resounded, a black whirlpool formed in the floor of the room. From the center a single girl emerged‐Tokisaki Kurumi had appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her long black hair covered her left eye, as the frills adorned to the hem of her skirt began to spread out, swirling as she made a graceful entrance. The dress on her body wasn't an Astral Dress, but rather a black dress that suited her looks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi? What happened? You could come in normally through the front entrance……" Although Shidou had widened his eyes from the surprise, the tone of his voice wasn't overly tense.</p>
<p class="null-p">There might have been more shudders had it been the old Kurumi, but now she was under</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ratatoskr's protection. That chilly sharpness from her expression was now gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Mana, who had crossed blades with Kurumi, still could hold a good impression of her. Of course, she didn't openly attack and, as Kurumi pointed out, she had called her by her actual name rather than codename……but Mana was still looking at Kurumi with a thorny gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Kurumi didn't care about this‐it was better to say she was quite pleased‐as the corners of her mouth were lightly raised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Well, everything must be done with care. Although this might be merely unnecessary resistance, as long as there is the possibility of not being uncovered by that person, I must take such means."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was left puzzled by this intriguing statement as Kurumi merely deeply smiled. Upon seeing this, Mana huffed from her nose even more from the displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to mediate between them, Shidou forced a smile to continue on while also changing the subject.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Going back to the topic, what do you mean by that? Why are you telling me this if you really think that……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just what that means."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi answered as she playfully spread out her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For some unknown reason, Mana-san's body has been cured. I can't understand the logic quite well, but the world has conveniently been rewritten. After that battle finished, everything ended satisfactorily……did you really think that things would go that smoothly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What do you want to say? Certainly things went off smoothly without a hitch, but that is an indisputable fact, is it not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Kotori who replied back to Kurumi. Before long, she had already changed to her black ribbons and switched to commander mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's responsible to think of it that way……no, perhaps that way of thinking is itself the</p>
<p class="null-p">fate of this world. In fact, until a while ago, I didn't hold any doubts about the status quo just like</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi placed her hand against her chin while contemplating. This roundabout manner caused Mana to cross her arms in irritation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get to the point already. Please say it clearly."</p>
<p class="null-p">From this, Kurumi wiped the smile from her mouth, looking on at Shidou, Kotori, Mana in that order as she told them as 'that'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐This world is not the world where we come from, but a world created by the hands of a certain person‐that is what I wanted to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they remained silent for a brief moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's missing voice leaked out from his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, not just Shidou. Even Kotori and Mana both had a stunned look as if unable to comprehend what Kurumi was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what are you talking about Kurumi? This isn't our original world……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. DEM's Isaac Westcott dreamt of overwriting the world with the neighboring</p>
<p class="null-p">world‐although it is different from what he intended, that person has achieved something close to that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Isaac Westcott. Just hearing that name caused Shidou's pulse to accelerate.</p>
<p class="null-p">The leader of DEM industries and the Magician that began everything. The main culprit for the creation of Spirits. His goal was to 'rewrite' the world into a world for Magicians by using the power of the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't an exaggeration to say that Shidou and the others had fought in order to stop that goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to protect their world, Shidou and the Spirits choose to stand up against that powerful enemy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the world still had been rewritten without their knowledge‐?</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou placed his hand against his forehead in an effort to manage these confusing thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a minute. Even if this is true, how were you able to notice this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana knitted her brow while asking in a state of bewilderment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, this question had a point. Before being told by Kurumi,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and the others had no doubts about this world. As Kurumi had said, with the valiant power to usurp and alter the world, it would be strange that only Kurumi had noticed this.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Kurumi seemed to expect that someone would ask this as she nodded while stretching out her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a total coincidence that I approached the truth, it was entirely a side effect. But……I can guarantee I am not making a mistake of any assumption. ‐Did you forget? The noble name of the omniscient</p>
<p class="null-p">Angel."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kurumi opened her palm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Rasiel'."</p>
<p class="null-p">After calling out that name, a book with a luxurious decoration appeared in front of Kurumi's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Angel 'Rasiel'. An omniscient Angel that contained all information in this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was originally an Angel owned by Nia, but after plundered the Sephira Crystal Isaac Westcott had stolen from Nia, Kurumi had now become a unique Spirit that could use two Angels.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this scene, Shidou held his breath. Certainly, by using 'Rasiel', it was possible to discover a hidden truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the possibility of Kurumi lying wasn't zero. But it wasn't just Kurumi who could use</p>
<p class="null-p">'Rasiel'. After receiving reiryoku from Mio, Nia also returned to the extent of being able to use</p>
<p class="null-p">'Rasiel' again. As long as it wasn't for the purpose of scaring Shidou and the others…...Kurumi wouldn't lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">But in that case, there was another problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-who……is it and how‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou uttered his words in a stunned manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a natural question. Mio who controlled the neighboring world and Westcott who had obtained the same power as her, had both died in the previous battle. The Spirits all had their powers sealed in Shidou and it goes without saying that Shidou wouldn't have rewritten the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least within the scope of his thoughts, there was no one else who could have achieved such a grand vision and certainly no one who would have motives for doing so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou turned to Kurumi looking for an answer, but Kurumi merely sighed while looking directly at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's easy for me to give you a direct answer, but no matter how I phrase it you'll likely won't believe me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, even if you say that, if you don't tell us anything‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please listen until I finish. ‐Rather than asking me, it's better if you look at it yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to her say this, Shidou widened his eyes as he quickly grasped Kurumi's intentions.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reiryoku of all of the Spirits were sealed within Shidou's body. As long as that was the case, he could do the same thing as Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see. So you want me to investigate with 'Rasiel'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi replied softly, withdrawing the 'Rasiel' in her hands as she pressed her own finger against her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Rasiel' is of course an option, but I recommend using 'Zafkiel'. Please try shooting yourself</p>
<p class="null-p">with the Tenth Bullet 'Yud'. ‐It's not pure knowledge but it should help invoke your lost memories through the help of your actual feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kurumi revealed a complicated expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she had already tried this. ‐Surely, there must be a reason why she believed this</p>
<p class="null-p">information couldn't be obtained through 'Rasiel'. "…………" With the tension moistening his throat, Shidou closed his eyes to focus his concentration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Zafkiel'‐The Tenth Bullet 'Yud'."</p>
<p class="null-p">After calling out that name, a short pistol appeared in his hands as the shadow was sucked into the muzzle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-sama‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Kotori and Mana looked over with a restless expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly, Shidou felt the same, but he couldn't let his cute younger sisters worry. I'll be fine. As he nodded to imply that, he pressed 'Zafkiel's gun against his temple.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, while imagining the memories he wished to explore, he pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that instant accompanied by that dry sound, a light shock ran through his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no pain. Instead, like chiseling a hole in a water bottle, the memories began to flow into the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a scene that he didn't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">A scene that he shouldn't have experienced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after the battle was over. On the battlefield where</p>
<p class="null-p">Mio disappeared. Mio's Sephira</p>
<p class="null-p">Crystal fell in front of Shidou and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. There were no differences in his memories up to that point. Mio's Sephira Crystal should have disappeared here‐ "…………!?" But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something unexpected jumped in front of Shidou's vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">A hand. A hand that that had stretched out towards the dying Sephira Crystal.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Sorry, but I'll be taking this.)</p>
<p class="null-p">That‐voice. A clear voice resounded in his mind. Shidou quickly turned to the other side.</p>
<p class="null-p">And he saw it. He saw the owner of that hand and voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, that person is‐ "‐Toh, ka‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time the scene unfolding in his mind was filled by a tremendous light, Shidou had half-consciously called out that name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka-san‐it's her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's words caused both Kotori and Mana to tighten their brows.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it wasn't as if he didn't understand their response. If he hadn't faced his own memories,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou would have likely had the same reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene just seen now was so far detached from reality</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka. The first Spirit Shidou had sealed excluding Kotori from five years ago, she had supported Shidou countless times through each crisis. It was no exaggeration to say that without her support, Shidou's heart would have yielded long ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because of this that it was so hard to believe. Even anyone else would have seen more</p>
<p class="null-p">likely, but it was Tohka who had taken Mio's Sephira Crystal and changed the world‐ "‐That's what I meant."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps sensing Shidou's confusion, Kurumi shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">……I see, certainly the</p>
<p class="null-p">actual experience from 'Zafkiel' made it more suitable than 'Rasiel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here is……a world that Tohka created? By using the power of</p>
<p class="null-p">Mio's Sephira Crystal……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shido muttered to himself, Kurumi made an exaggerated nod while lowering her eyes down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There's no doubt that this is the world that Tohka-san has dreamt up. It is an ideal space where all problems are resolved in a cohesive way and all concerns are naturally removed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would she…….want to do this……?" Shidou was left stunned.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, this world was very different from the one that Westcott had envisioned. It was a dream world that had the same appearance as the original world, but with all problems removed or resolved. In a sense, it could be described as a Tohka style world.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that didn't mean he was convinced. In the end, it wasn't like Tohka to take Mio's Sephira</p>
<p class="null-p">Crystal to rewrite the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi lightly shrugged her shoulders while shaking her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Unfortunately, I don't know about that either. As you know, even the omniscient 'Rasiel' cannot provide information about the uncertain future or the hearts of people."</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Nia the original owner of 'Rasiel' had also once said the same thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having said that, the information currently available was quite adequate. While trying to calm his racing heartbeat, Shidou gave a small bow of thanks to Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, thank you, Kurumi. If it wasn't for you, I would have never recognized the source of the uncomfortable feeling coming from this world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, not recognizing this is also a type of blessing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-you……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As beads of sweat dropped down his cheek, Kurumi interrupted him from continuing to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐This is the ideal world created by Tohka-san. It should be a convenient world for Shidou-san as well. Although it is different from the original world, there is no difference from reality if you don't realize it is a dream."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kurumi replied in a playful gesture, Mana huffed from her nose in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you truly think so, why did you tell Nii-sama the truth?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I am not a good girl like everyone else." The answer was in line with Kurumi's usual attitude, but the ambiguous reply caused Mana to frown resentfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, just kidding. Please don't give me that scary look." Kurumi smiled before suddenly lowering her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐I have no intention of denying this gentle world. I also thought it would be nice to immerse in this world if it could last forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori asked with a suspicious look, Kurumi breathed a small sigh before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is certainly the ideal world. But it was one created by forcibly taking away Mio-san's Sephira Crystal. ‐If left alone, this world will likely perish along with Tohka-san." "Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and this world are self-destructing?</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou held his breath at Kurumi's unsettling revelation. "Wait a minute. What is going on……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you ask that, I can't answer that. Just like what I said before, I have no idea what are</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka-san's intentions."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi shook her head in an extremely calm attitude as Shidou and the others fell into a panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">……No. To be precise, it wasn't as if Kurumi wasn't unmoved by this. However, having reached the truth earlier than Shidou and the others, she had already experienced being shocked by this beforehand. The time he had spent with Kurumi allowed Shidou to notice this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I, see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since realizing that, Shidou had finally recovered. ‐In this chaotic situation, Shidou felt that he couldn't let Kurumi carry the entire burden of acting "calm".</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps noticing Shidou's intentions, Kurumi raised a small smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Anyway that is all of the information I've learned so far. I'll leave the response to the professionals."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi said that, she pulled her skirt in an elegant position, taking dance steps to gradually sink into the shadows like falling away from the stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ripples formed in the shadows like a whirlpool‐until it disappeared without a trace. "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while, the living room of the Itsuka residence had turned silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐the silence didn't last long. Kotori threw a Chupa Chups from her pocket into her mouth as she sharpened her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……At any rate, let's take action. If Kurumi's words are true, there isn't any time to waste. We'll gather everyone together to take the needed countermeasures." "……! Aah……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Kotori's words, Shidou nodded fiercely.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Fragmentary Chapter 2: Happiness</p>
<p class="null-p">Recently, her mood wasn't bad at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">As to say why, after a certain time a change began to occur to the emotions transmitted from her other self.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprise, joy, delight, fun‐</p>
<p class="null-p">A tide of emotions that was incomparable to beforehand constantly flowed without interruption. The change was so dramatic that she felt as if flowers had begun sprouting on extremely frozen soil.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fear and timidity had disappeared without a trace and there were no longer any feelings of loneliness and sorrow. Although there was still strong anger in-between moments, it was swallowed up in the whirlpool of excitement and joy that it was no longer visible.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other me must have encountered something good.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she didn't know what was going on. What she could do at best was only be vaguely</p>
<p class="null-p">aware of the feelings of her other self. But that was enough for her now.</p>
<p class="null-p">A warm feeling flowed in from her other self. She was happy just feeling it. If the other me was happy, then she would be happy. She experienced her other self's enjoyment bouncing around in her own heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">But of course‐</p>
<p class="null-p">That is say; she didn't want to know if "something" had caused her to change this way. If so, then she must certainly be deceived.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: The Stage Curtain Rises For Those Two</p>
<p class="null-p">An hour had passed since Kurumi's visit to Shidou and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the briefing room of the airship 'Fraxinus', which floated 15,000 meters above Tenguu City, all of the Spirits had gathered from the Spirit mansion or their respective homes in the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone was seated in a round table and dressed in pajamas covered by coats. Well, even if it could be abridged like that, there were wide variations from Miku's moko moko pajamas to the ink stains on the cuffs of Nia's shabby jacket.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, it didn't seem like a tense gathering, but it was only this time when everyone could convene together. Although they could have waited until the next morning, not even a single second could be squandered. And the most important part was to not let Tohka grow suspicious, so they had to do this while she was sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">Additionally, Maria was told to investigate this world and Tohka at the same time. Mana was on standby on the warship in case of an emergency situation. The Fraxinus crew had also gathered on the bridge. This level of tension hadn't been seen on 'Fraxinus' since the battle against Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This world……is made by……Tohka-san?" After a brief explanation of the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who responded to Shidou with this question was Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her soft fluffy hair swayed a little as she inclined her head with widened eyes. Subsequently, the Yoshinon puppet on her left hand also flexibly made the same pose.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no fear or scorn in her expression. At best, it was on the level of confusion and bewilderment.</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't just limited to Yoshino. Kaguya, Yuzuru, Mukuro, Nia, Miku, and Natsumi‐all of the Spirits that gathered here had a similar look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell are you saying, Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. What does this mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuuah……mun, apologizes……to be suddenly stirred awake by imōtogo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The world has been rewritten‐is that why my manuscript is still blank!? Damn, even though it was completed in the original world!</p>
<p class="null-p">There's nothing that can be done about it since it was rewritten!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, is that some sort of system? Well then, in the original world, Natsumi-san must have asked me for a hug!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Impossible. That is completely impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so on, everyone was confused, yawning, or making incessant noise.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't unreasonable either. It wasn't as if they disbelieved Shidou or couldn't hear this story, but being too far away from the norm they could only remained stunned. In fact, when Shidou first discovered the truth of this world from Kurumi, he also had a similar reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, under such circumstances, there was a person who quickly grasped the situation and sharpened her eyes‐it was Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Speak more in detail."</p>
<p class="null-p">While speaking, she placed her elbows on the round table, pressing her fingers against each other while turning to look at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone else felt this unusual atmosphere as they stopped talking and also turned their attention to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah. Actually‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gently coughed a few times before beginning to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">He told them how Tohka took Mio's Sephira Crystal as it was about to disappear. And also‐if this went on, Tohka would perish along with this world. "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……How."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the conversation continued, everyone's expressions gradually grew paler.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking on at this crowd, Kotori, who was wearing her red jacket on her shoulders, stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐It just as he says. I thought it was a bad joke at first, but Shidou has already confirmed this with 'Zafkiel'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-why would Tohka-san do such a thing……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku asked with sweat dripped down her cheeks. However, Shidou could only shake his head in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know……but I don't think that Tohka would do such a thing without a reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Shidou, everyone turned taciturn. This level of silence indicated that they were in silent agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Tohka wouldn't have rewritten the world for the sake of fulfilling her own desires.</p>
<p class="null-p">There must have been a reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou couldn't understand this reason. If this continued on, Tohka would be wiped out along with this world. He didn't expect to suddenly discover that grave matter. There had to be a reason. Even if it meant taking a dangerous risk, there must be a motive for why she snatched away Mio's Sephira Crystal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Let's organize what has just been said."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou's thoughts were caught in a dead end, Kotori slammed her hand down and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka took Mio's Sephira Crystal in the original world and used it to create this world. But this world has a time constraint and if left alone it will destroy itself. We must let Tohka relinquish control over Mio's Sephira Crystal as soon as possible and return the world to its original state. For this reason, it is imperative to know Tohka's goal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka's goal……? When it comes to that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guess. Something like wanting to eat until the stomach is about to burst?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru spoke with a difficult look as they placed their hands against their chins. Although the remark itself was very nonsensical, the expressions of those two were still very serious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That seems to be just like Tohka, but it's impossible to rewrite the world for that reason. Besides, that could have already been done in the original world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi squinted while scratching her cheeks, but what she had said wasn't wrong. "Mun……wouldn't it be better to ask Tohka directly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Mukuro spoke while rubbing her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How to describe that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou responded with a wry smile‐but then he suddenly stopped talking as he let out a groan. Certainly, a method that was too simple couldn't be used for capture. But since the opponent was Tohka, he couldn't deny that this method may be effective.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps Kotori had also thought the same as she grumbled while making a complicated expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Certainly, if it can't be helped, we may have to do that as the last resort. After all, we don't</p>
<p class="null-p">even know if Tohka has discovered that we found out the truth of this world. In the current situation where Tohka controls this world, there is the possibility……of everyone's memories being reset to before we learned the truth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to what Kotori had said, the other Spirits let out a startled gasp.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was difficult to imagine, as well as the fact that he didn't want to believe Tohka would do this, it was also true that Tohka had rewritten the world. Under the premise that the other side has an overwhelming advantage, they always had to predict the worst case scenario.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's true, but we can't just do nothing. Let's first try to secretly test Tohka‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Shidou was in the middle of speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ho? I was wondering what my sisters were doing at such an hour, but it turns out you're consulting to destroy my world?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly hearing that voice come from somewhere, Shidou's body quickly stiffened. "T-this voice is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Tohka……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou called out that name, the space at the center of the round table began to distort. From there, a girl with long night colored hair appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was wearing pajamas just like everyone else. But the usual innocence couldn't be seen in her eyes as it was lit with an icy brilliance. She seemed to be floating in the air in an invisible chair, overlooking Shidou with a detached look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't concern yourself of how you got here; continue immersing yourself in your dreams."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-you are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that her manner of speech and atmosphere was completely different from Tohka, Shidou was at a loss for words‐but then he noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, certainly the current Tohka has the same face but her personality wasn't the same as the normal Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">By now, Shidou already had some knowledge of seeing Tohka in such strange state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible……inverse‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to what Shidou had said, Kotori's eyes widened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the inversion of the Sephira Crystal, it was a phenomenon that occurred when a Spirit's heart is overcome by despair. The attributes of the reiryoku a Spirit emits changes and the ego vanishes‐or in the case for Tohka another personality would manifest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore, Tohka has had this inversion occur to her several times in the past. At those</p>
<p class="null-p">moments, it was another cruel and violent persona that took control of Tohka's body. "Inversion‐in other words, the one who rewrote the world is you rather than the usual Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Origami displayed an alert look as she inquired, inverse Tohka faintly narrowed her eyes as if to denote confirmation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time as experiencing tension and dread from the sudden situation, Shidou also felt a strange sense of relief as well. After all, the Tohka that Shidou had known wasn't the sort of girl who would steal Mio's Sephira crystal in order to rewrite the world‐</p>
<p class="null-p">But just because he realized this doesn't mean the matter had been resolved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it wasn't Tohka's will to rewrite the world, he still didn't understand inverse Tohka's goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Now that the person herself has appeared this early in the story, I'll get straight to the topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is your goal? Why did you want to do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori likely had the same thoughts as Shidou. Even with a few drops of sweat dripping below</p>
<p class="null-p">her forehead, she didn't break her brash tone as she raised that question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, this was the last resort, but the situation was different if their plans had already been exposed. Now, it didn't make sense to be cautious anymore. Perhaps she had thought there was no choice but to ask the question directly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, inverse Tohka stared at Kotori for a while before she let out a "humph" sound from her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, it doesn't feel that bad holding the entire world within my hands."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I saw the death of the woman who was my mother through Tohka's eyes. Even though I loathe that woman, her power is a different matter. Since it was about to disappear anyway, there was no problems for me to use it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to what she had said, Shidou concentrated on observing inverse Tohka to guess her real intentions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was this really the reason, or was this an attempt to deceive everyone present in order to hide another goal? If it was the latter, then what was the real goal that she didn't want anyone to know‐?</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking about this, such a question arose‐yes. The Tohka who Shidou had met this morning was undoubtedly the usual Tohka. If inverse Tohka's goal was truly to control the world, could the reason of returning ownership of the body to the true Tohka also be……?</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was still considering this, inverse Tohka angrily sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well. Already this has become my world. As such you all amount to ants that can do nothing to change this status quo."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said this while quickly raised her right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of her movements, all of the Spirits suddenly felt tense. Even Shidou couldn't help but hold his breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">(As long as she knows, everyone's memories will revert to back before discovering the truth……there is the possibility of that.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Such words uttered by Kotori earlier passed through his thoughts. This world was now in the hands of inverse Tohka. For her, to do such a thing would not be difficult at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if feeling the tension in this crowd, inverse Tohka snorted once again and snapped her fingers. Instantly, the figure of inverse Tohka floating in the air distorted and disappeared into the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few moments, the briefing room returned back to before she had appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Everyone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Among the stunned group, it was Kotori who first raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are your memories not mistaken!? Are there any abnormalities with your bodies!? If you have something that you're worried about, say it no matter how small!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While hurriedly surveying everyone's appearance, she quickly talked on in rapid succession.</p>
<p class="null-p">But her nervousness wasn't unwarranted. The girl who, without any exaggeration, ruled over this world had appeared in front of everyone just now. From her perspective, Shidou and the others must be obstacles that were trying to disturb her world. It was difficult to imagine that she had just left without doing anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the Spirits shook their heads after looking at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no……I think I am fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun, Muku is uninjured."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No abnormalities here."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, at that moment, Nia widened her eyes as if noticing something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah～! N-not good imōto-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! What's wrong, did something happen!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My chest has turned flat! It was around an F-cup until a while ago!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori silently half-closed her eyes as she landed a karate chop on Nia's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It hurts～! Why imōto-chan, that was just Nia-chan's small stylish joke to lighten the atmosphere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consider the time and place for that……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shrugged her shoulders in irritation as she looked around once again before forcing out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like everyone is fine……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……it looks like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What is she going to do? We should be hindrances to her and if left alone……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐The possibilities that can be thought up can be roughly divided into three."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori groaned while placing her hand against her chin, Origami raised her voice to reply to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First, we are totally worthless to her. It may be humiliating, but this is the most welcomed result for us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, that's true. What next?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Second, she has already erased specific memories from our minds, but her power let us think that 'nothing had happened'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shudder. But that isn't impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweat began to drip down from all of the Spirits. But this was certainly feasible if relying on inverse Tohka's power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it should be possible to immediately check 'Rasiel' to see if any changes have occurred. I don't think she would miss that. If she really altered our memory, it should have already wiped the suspicion we are holding right now. Therefore, at the time we are having this conversation, the possibility isn't zero but very low."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And third‐that is to say she let us go. In other words, the actions we are expected to take are relevant to her goal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt his heartbeat accelerate upon hearing what Origami had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse Tohka was trying to make them do something‐if that was true. That would explain</p>
<p class="null-p">inverse Tohka's sudden entrance and even her leaving them, whom should serve as an obstacle, alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits were all likely thinking the same thing as they remained silent with a difficult expression marking their faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having said that, they still have come up with any specific countermeasure. Their opponent was the lord of this world. Able to fulfill any wish at the snap of her fingertips, she was the strongest Spirit that had obtained the power of 'Deus'. If there is something desired, he would only need to rely on his own strength. For the sake of an argument, even if it was necessary to use the power of the Spirits, operating a brute force collaboration would feel uneasy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Kotori who raised her voice to lead everyone that was lost in the whirlpool of confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her goal is still unknown, but there is one thing that is certain now that the other side's identity</p>
<p class="null-p">has been revealed. ‐If so, there is only one thing we should do." Right Shidou? And so, Kotori glanced over at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to her words and looking into her eyes, Shidou quickly understood everything. That's right. ‐Since Shidou has repeated done "this" several times now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how powerful the opponent, as long as it is a Spirit‐you should be able to seal that power."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That was Shidou's power. The power to seal reiryoku that Mio gave to him in order to perfectly recreate Shinji.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so, you just have to seal Mio's power that has been forcibly taken into Tohka's body……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐The world will be resorted to its original state and Tohka's selfdestruction can be prevented……is that true?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. ‐Although it may be necessary to add a 'perhaps' considering how unreliable this premise is."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori sighed softly while relaxing her shoulders. Well, Kotori likely didn't imagine that the</p>
<p class="null-p">situation would turn out like this either. It was too arbitrary to state without solid proof first. However, there was no other way. Shidou felt his throat moisten as he clenched his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In order to seal Tohka's power‐take her on date and make her fall in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori nodded, she took out a Chupa Chups from her pocket and threw it into her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now‐let's begin our war (date)."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The next morning. Shidou stood in front of room 410 of the spirit mansion‐Tohka's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">The latest communication device hung around his neck, and on the other end was 'Ratatoskr's elite on standby.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Afterwards, Shidou had continued the strategy meeting and decided to begin the capture of inverse Tohka immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Needless to say, the opponent was a Spirit with an unknown ability. It should have taken more time to prepare and consider countermeasures for attempting this challenge.</p>
<p class="null-p">But since they didn't know how long until Tohka and Mio's Sephira would reach their limit,</p>
<p class="null-p">there wasn't enough time for such slow deliberations‐anyway, the most important element in these matters was the momentum. This was the common opinion shared by both Kotori and Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Well then, hurry up Shidou. The opponent is just an opponent, so don't be nervous. She is</p>
<p class="null-p">indeed very powerful, but hasn't the story only just begun? If you proceed with the date as usual, there shouldn't be any problems."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou nodded while hearing Kotori's voice from the communication device, he quickly took a deep breath and rang the doorbell of Tohka's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no response. Shidou waited for ten seconds before pressing the doorbell again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the front entrance door didn't make the slightest movement. On the contrary, not even the faintest footsteps approaching could be heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……? No way, is there no one home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's impossible. Tohka's response is certainly still coming from within the house. If you</p>
<p class="null-p">think about it, perhaps she is still sleeping or simply ignoring‐" "‐It is also possible to perhaps use a method we didn't expect to falsify the response."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria's voice echoed to complement Kotori's words. Certainly, something of that level would be trivial for the current Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, no, it was precisely because of this that the question grew stronger. Why would Tohka, who had already obtained so much power, try to mislead her location to Shidou?</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, Shidou couldn't come up with a reason. After ringing the doorbell again,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou subconsciously reached out for the doorknob.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The door is open……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou whispered while opening the thick front door that was peculiar to the spirit mansion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What!? Then just as I thought, is she still sleeping? But we're not talking about the usual Tohka,</p>
<p class="null-p">maybe inverse Tohka doesn't have the habit of locking doors……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I'll go confirm this. If she's still sleeping, I'll wait for her to wake up. It may be that she couldn't hear the doorbell at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly‐so go confirm it."</p>
<p class="null-p">While agreeing with Kotori, Shidou fully opened the door and stepped into Tohka's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was a room he had already visited several times already, the atmosphere today felt different. Was it because the host had changed or was the source caused by Shidou's own impression?</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, just as Kotori had said, he couldn't be too nervous. Shidou gulped as he raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey? Tohka? Are you in? Can I come in?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, he tried to keep his tone as causal as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">But again there was no response. Shidou gently tapped the communication device to send the signal before taking off his shoes to enter the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was halfway across the corridor, a sudden change appeared in the room for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the left side‐there was the sound of a collision coming from the direction of the bathroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Tohka, were you here? Sorry, I got worried since the door was open‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou had begun to use the excuse prepared beforehand‐but those words came to halt midway through. But that was a natural response. After all, what appeared here was, with her long hair dripping wet, Tohka who didn't have a single thread of clothes covering herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!?To～tototohka……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it is you. What a noisy and rude human."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said with a look of disgust‐that was the tone coming from inverse Tohka. She crossed her arms without any embarrassment. As her misty hair swayed over her white breasts, Shidou quickly looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maria!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please rest assured. I've already applied the screen filter."</p>
<p class="null-p">From the communicator, he could hear Maria and Kotori's voices, along with that of the disappointed male crew. However, Shidou could feel reassured right now. His throat trembled as he struggled not to look directly at the now nude Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, uh……w-what are you doing……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong with taking a bath in my own room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah yes, there's nothing wrong……"</p>
<p class="null-p">A completely valid reason. Clearly, this was the fault of Shidou, who had entered without the</p>
<p class="null-p">owner's consent. As Shidou's entire face was bright red, he lowered his head in apology.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tohka didn't care to pursue this any further. She halfdazedly narrowed her eyes while slanting her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐So what? With great difficulty, I let you all go, are you still not satisfied? But that doesn't matter now. Life, body, memories, chose which one you want to discard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-wait a minute!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing inverse Tohka slowly raise her hand, Shidou shook his head in a panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No that's not it…...I came to invite you on a date today!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐What? Date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse Tohka raised her brow in suspicion while placing her hand against her chin as if contemplating something.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds, she grabbed Shidou's collar, pulling him closer to herself. "Wa……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't scream. Do you want to be erased?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The glare from her eyes was brimming with a sadistic light. Shidou trembled as he shook his head again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this, inverse Tohka turned around to huff from her nose before continuing on. "Date. You said you want to go on a date.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright. I'll accompany you just this once."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!? R-really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing inverse Tohka's unexpected response, Shidou couldn't help but widen his eyes. No, of course getting this consent was his goal from the very beginning, but he didn't think she would accept this so easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, inverse Tohka was still grabbing Shidou's collar while lower her gaze slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. ‐But, this boorishness won't be permitted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh‐?" At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing Tohka strengthen her stare, Shidou heard a buzzing noise come from his neck as he reflexively closed his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch……"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was the feeling of smoke rising as the smell of something burning ensnared his nostrils. Shidou quickly understood. The small communicator attached to his neck had been destroyed. "Wwhat……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's my line. You're the one who invited me on a date. Don't rely on such foolhardy tricks and use your own means to entertain me."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, she threw a glance at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">What she said was impeccable rhetoric. Shidou was left speechless as he could only nod in silence as if surrendering.</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards, inverse Tohka let out a satisfied sigh. She loosened her grip and finally released Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cough……cough ……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So human, say it once more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The words you said earlier. You can't say that you've forgotten during this little moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse Tohka spoke while staring at Shidou with a piercing gaze. Shidou nervously felt his breathing draw thin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was only one line that came to mind. Shidou fixed the front of his collar, adjusting his breathing while looking back at inverse Tohka‐and opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka, starting from now, can you go on a date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ooh, really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the voice that echoed at the next moment, Shidou felt a slight hint of discomfort.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the sound of the voice hadn't changed, the voice had sounded too innocent and cheerful for inverse Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">How to describe this, it felt as if the whole atmosphere had eased.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyebrows that had a sharp look were now relaxed in a gentle arc.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the white face he remembered for its chillness had faint traces of a red hue shine through, as the corners of her mouth outlined a smile as if unable to contain her joy and excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just as if‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"To……Tohka? Is this Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's voice was overcome by surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Tohka, who had been inversed until just now, had changed back to her usual self in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……? What's wrong, Shidou. Of course it's me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka made a confused face while twisting her neck. Shidou hurriedly laughed in order to dodge the question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-that's right. Haha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. What were you talking about……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if noticing something, Tohka slowly lowered her eyes‐only her hair and water droplets were covering her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…..!? Whaaaaaaat is this Shidou‐! Why am I like this right now!?" Tohka screamed with a flushed red face as she hurried to cover her body. "Eh, ehh. No, Tohka you did this yourself‐" "Don't say that idiot! If I undressed myself I wouldn't forget it! Ha, could it be that 'Haniel' was used on my clothes……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no! That's a false accusation!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was possible to do this with 'Haniel' at great difficulty, Shidou refused to use that as a way out. He frantically shook his head in appeal for his innocence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while Tohka looked up at Shidou with a bright red face, she let out a "……muu" sound from her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes. I don't quite know what this means……but if Shidou say so, I'll believe it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To, Tohka….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if Shidou takes off a girl's clothes, he wouldn't lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Oh, um. Thanks……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou delusively frowned while scratching his face. ……Since that wasn't necessarily wrong, it became even harder to deny.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, he couldn't afford to leave Tohka like this. Shidou went to the bathroom to bring out a bath towel to cover Tohka's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh……thank you, Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't mention it. Hurry up and dry yourself and change clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu. At any rate, it's been a long time since we've last had a date……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka warped the towel around herself and spoke while standing up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou thought this over for a moment. ‐Certainly, his goal was to make Tohka fall in love and then seal her reiryoku. But it was inverse Tohka who had snatched away Mio's Sephira Crystal. He didn't know if it was correct solution to go on a date with the current Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in only a few moments after this idea had passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Oh, I'm looking forward to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Tohka's innocent smile, there was no alternative for return.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Shidou! Shidou! Please respond!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting on the captain's seat of the airship 'Fraxinus', Kotori called out several times to the microphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, other than the static coming from the loudspeakers installed on the bridge, there was no response at all. In addition, the autonomous camera following Shidou was no longer delivering images. In short, it was no longer possible to contact Shidou, who was caught in inverse Tohka's bosom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……what the hell exactly happened!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐The moment Tohka's reiryoku values rose, the communication device and autonomous camera were both broken. Almost certainly, this has to be Tohka's doing."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl sitting next to the captain's seat‐Maria, said with serious look while gently stroking her chin. Kotori frowned as she bit down on with her teeth on the Chupa Chups in her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about the new autonomous camera?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That as well‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Until just now, the image was still being delivered, but it broke</p>
<p class="null-p">down the moment it entered the</p>
<p class="null-p">observational zone. I believe that sending even more will only produce the same result."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the deputy commander Kannazuki Kyouhei on the other side who replied to block Maria's voice. He also made a serious look while turning his face to the main monitor that was displaying the noise.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, from the tone of his voice, there was a rivalry that could be felt with Maria. In fact, after intercepting her line, he shot a glance to Maria while grinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing him like this, Maria returned back with an annoyed expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, we have no choice but to leave this to Shidou. Let's keep the battle deployment only in the case of an emergency."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying Maria? The first priority should be to recover Shidou-kun. He should be</p>
<p class="null-p">recovered onto 'Fraxinus' immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki quickly refuted Maria's proposal. Across from the captain's seat, sparks of electricity intersected as their eyes meet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand what you mean. But since Tohka has already begun to be on guard, intervening now would only produce the opposite effect. I believe it would be better to wait now and see what happens."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oops, to think those words would come from 'Fraxinus's AI. Losing Shidou-kun here means a tactical failure. Here we ought to regroup the plan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that skull of yours is stuffed with anything other than overcooked udon, I would like you to think a little more. There is no need to do something like that if Tohka tries to harm Shidou. The fact that she destroyed the camera and communicator means it is more appropriate to say that</p>
<p class="null-p">there are things she doesn't want us to know. If you haven't figured this out yet, will you please shut up and live the rest of your life as the doormat of the Itsuka residence?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……this time your choice of words for persecution has become too crafty Maria! Even if you praise me that much, I won't hand over the seat next to the commander! Although it is easy to be abused by the commander, although it is easy to be stepped on by the commander! How much hardship do you think I spent in order to come to this place! Even if you are a mechanical girl that just gained form‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So annoying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, who felt numb from the argument flying above her head, raised both of her hands from the captain's seat. The left hand landed on the pit of Kannazuki's stomach, while Maria on the right side seemed to avoid the blow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, let's take a look at this situation. Since it is impossible to get an autonomous camera to view at close range, let's try from a distance‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as Kotori was in the middle of speaking, the phone in her pocket began to vibrate while making a light ringtone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The first person that passed through her mind was Shidou. With the communicator destroyed, Kotori thought Shidou must have sneaked past Tohka to make a phone call to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the name displayed on the phone was outside her expectations. She couldn't help but frown.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori? What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">While shaking her head to respond to Maria, Kotori hit the reply button. Soon, a familiar laugh came from the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Kihihihihi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it Kurumi? Sorry, but I'm quite busy right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori spoke with a sigh as she held the smartphone against her ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. The person who had called was none other than Tokisaki Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, please rest assured. Shidou-san is safe. It seems the date with Tohka-san has been decided. The destruction of the camera and communicator is also mainly to prevent you all from getting in the way of the date."</p>
<p class="null-p">"! How do you know‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Halfway through, Kotori stopped speaking. ‐It went without saying. Now in Kurumi's hands, there was an omniscient Angel that even discovered the truth of this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really appreciate you only got that Angel recently."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, I'll accept that as a compliment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi let out an amused giggle as she laughed. From the unexpected sense of dread within that, Kotori could only sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, why did you come tell me this specifically? Depending on your answer, I would like to thank you for the time being."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all, I've also received a lot of care from Kotori-san. Let's mutually help each other out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi kept speaking in a joking manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐But yes. The matter is not only that. Kotori-san, please come to the location I'm about to tell you alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What do you mean? Haven't you already confirmed it with</p>
<p class="null-p">'Rasiel'? I'm in the middle of the operation right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. I know. But know that all of your ears and eyes have been destroyed, the only thing you can do is stand there, right? If that's the case, can't you accompany me for a while?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You……even if that is the case, for the commander to leave her post‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I said it was for the sake of Shidou-san and Tohka-san's date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Kurumi's words, Kotori raised her brow in suspicion.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Nearing the end of March, the climate had basically warmed up. As she arrived at ground level without wearing a thick overcoat, Kotori began to look around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's supposed to be around here‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori had descended down from 'Fraxinus' and to the corner of a natural park on the outskirts of Tenguu City. The vast site was covered with trees and in the distance one could see wooden exercise equipment and other facilities. It seemed to be too peaceful for a gathering spot designated by Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it would be a lie to say there was no sense of incongruity at all. ‐Even though it was early morning for a day of rest, there wasn't the sight of children playing or owners walking alongside their dogs. It was as if a spacequake warning had been issued.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……? Is that not imōtogo yonder there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a voice was heard coming from behind as Kotori was peeking around her surroundings to survey the circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mukuro?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the figure of the girl standing there, Kotori's eyes broadened. Yes, in a park without any inhabitants, Mukuro was there wearing a light coat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? You should be at the Spirit mansion……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. It's true that I should be at room at this hour……but I received a call from Kurumi citing.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you wish to assist Nushi-sama and Tohka, head to this designated location."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The contents of that phone call were exactly the same as what Kotori experienced. It seemed both Mukuro and Kotori had been called here by Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is she trying to achieve? Bringing me and Mukuro here‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori was strenuously pondering over Kurumi's unfathomable intentions, a clear voice sounded from another direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't this Kotori-san and Mukuro-san? What a coincidence! Ah, or did you come to see me? Or is this really fate!? Either one would be lovely, so who wants to be hugged first‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While spitting words more in line with a suspicious person, Miku rushed over. Kotori raised a hand to stop her progress as she called out Mukuro's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro, who understood Kotori's intentions, karate chopped the crown of Miku's head. Because of that, Miku at least turned docile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyah! Mukuro-san is too easily provoked!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really……but even Miku is here. ‐Were you called here by</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why do you know that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku said as her eyes rounded in surprise. From the expected answer, Kotori's expression turned stern while biting into her nails.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku as well‐of course Kurumi told you to come here if you wanted to help Shidou and</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? No, Kurumi-san said, 'I want to talk to you alone……about the future between Miku-san and me', in a whisper that sounded quite distressed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I-is that right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori replied back as her sweat was dripping down.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Apparently, there were also variations in how the invitations were delivered. But to have someone actually rush out after such suspicious words were uttered, perhaps it was necessary for Miku to take supplementary lessons in order to prevent being scammed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, as Kotori was considering that‐ "Kotori……san?" "……Huh, everyone is here……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ho? A preceding visitor. So it appears it is not just us who have received an invitation from the darkness."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like Mukuro and Miku, the Spirits began to gather in the park one after the other. Yoshino, Natsumi, the Yamai sisters, Origami, and Nia who had a sleepy look despite it already being morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of the Spirits except for Tohka and Kurumi, a total of nine people had gathered in this deserted natural park.</p>
<p class="null-p">While watching this occur, Kotori distorted her face in a grumpy manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……This is really suspicious. To gather everyone together after telling me to come alone. Why on earth did Kurumi want to do this‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ufufu. Please don't be so suspicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprised by the sound of that sudden voice, Kotori's shoulders slightly trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if responding to this, the shadows coalesced to the center of where everyone was standing as Kurumi's figure emerged wearing a black overcoat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi-san‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Wow, you've all arrived."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya! I've been waiting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Confronted by Kurumi's arrival, the Spirits all displayed various different responses. As Kurumi looked over each one pleasantly, she turned her eyes to Kotori while smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been expecting you all, welcome everyone. I'm glad all of you could gather here without missing a single person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Greetings are good. But starting from now, let's talk business. ‐What was your reason for gathering us together? Why did you call us one by one? And is it true that this concerns Shidou and Tohka?" "Ara, ara, what an impatient young lady. You can't become a mature lady without allowing a bit more time for composure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Thanks for that advice."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori scowled back, Kurumi giggled as she began to twirl around as if in the manner of acting in a play.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, let me explain to you one by one. ‐First of all, there is a need to gather everyone together. This is to ensure that Shidou-san and Tohka-san's is successful."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi repeated what she had said over the phone. The majority of the Spirits, including Kotori, nodded in order to encourage her to continue. Among the Spirits there was one who let out an, "Eh! Aren't we here to talk about the future between us!", voice that resembled Miku in a shocked state. Another one had rubbed her eyes while saying, "Hey, I heard you'll introduce me to a legendary assistant that can finish any manuscript under an hour, I've been feeling drowsy……" in a voice that resembled Nia…..well it seemed those two had begun deviating to what they had expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And the reason for why I've gathered you all separately is very simple. ‐After all, it would be</p>
<p class="null-p">strange to get along so friendly with opponents you'll be fighting on</p>
<p class="null-p">the battlefield from now on. "……Ha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Kurumi utter those words out so pleasantly, Kotori couldn't help but let out a doubtful voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it wasn't just Kotori. The other Spirits also showed similar reactions. Kurumi smiled even more as if finding everyone's responses to these circumstances to be unbearably amusing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will fight……? Us? What the hell are you talking about Kurumi? Did you lose your mind from swallowing the wrong medicine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, regrettably, I'm very much sane. If I had went mad, my life would be a bit more carefree right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi spoke while shrugging her shoulders in a self-depreciating manner. As Kotori was</p>
<p class="null-p">unable to determine Kurumi's intentions, she crossed her arms together while shutting up silently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Kotori's speechlessness as an urge for her to continue, Kurumi continued on with a light smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's talk in order. ‐First of all, Tohka-san's condition is worse than you think. Soon, her body will destroy the world by itself. It may be difficult to even finish the date with Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Faced with those sudden words, Kotori and the others couldn't help but hold their breath in.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had already known that Tohka's life was in danger. But they didn't expect the deadline to be so urgent, it really was‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that's true, why didn't you say that from the beginning,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara, why would Kotori-san ask such a question? If Shidou-san knew about this, could he still enjoy a happy date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The alternative was being wrapped in smoke around Kurumi's motives, but what she said was certainly true. While gritting the back of her teeth, Kotori tempered any outburst while urging her to continue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Kurumi respectfully saluted back as she continued to talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, even for me, I don't want this world to come to an end. And the only person in this world</p>
<p class="null-p">that could stop Tohka-san is Shidou-san. But even for Shidou-san, achieving this would be difficult if there isn't enough time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It feels that you've been rambling on, but there have been few useful words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. What do you want to say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the Yamai sisters anxiously asked, Kurumi slowed down to allow them to speak before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's an extremely simple matter. ‐If there is little time left; I would like to increase it. That is to say, we would use our reiryoku to preserve this world for as much as possible. ‐Until Shidou-san can make Tohka-san fall in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This world……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Expand its time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino and Natsumi raised their browns in confusion as they looked at each other. Kurumi exaggeratingly nodded as if to say "yes that's right".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whether fortunate or unfortunate, this entire world created by</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka‐all of it lies within Tohka-san's domain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐I see. So that's what you meant by fighting."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Origami who first showed an understanding of Kurumi's explanation. Her eyes were</p>
<p class="null-p">serene but displayed a clear flickering and brilliant willpower while staring at Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu. It helps that you can understand so quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? W-why did you say that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Miku searched for an explanation, she looked alternatively back and forth between Kurumi and Origami. Then, Origami began talking in a light tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I believe everyone has experienced this. Once an Angel or Astral</p>
<p class="null-p">Dress is manifested, it consumes the reiryoku in the body. However, this reiryoku won't disappear into thin air but rather be circulated into the surrounding space. Equipment such as CR-unit weapon 'Einherjar' is designed to build a blade through recycling the reiryoku from those surroundings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understanding. That is the lance master Origami used."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……so what is that supposed to mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming what Yuzuru had said, Nia slanted her head. Origami continued on after quickly glancing at those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that the present world has come under Tohka's control, the reiryoku we emit will be absorbed into this world and consequently may help Tohka's world survive longer. And the most effective way to consume reiryoku‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐To use Angels to fight against each other, is that the case?" As Kotori interrupted, Origami nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Kurumi clapped her hands while letting out a giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so you've received a beautiful answer‐can everyone understand that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that regard, everyone had turned silent. But it couldn't be avoided. After all, anyone would feel disoriented after receiving so much information so suddenly.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, among the group, one hand slowly raised up. ‐That hand belonged to Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Sorry Kurumin, but can I investigate this with my 'Rasiel'? It doesn't mean that I can't trust Kurumin……but this is just a bit too strange."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as Kurumi narrowed her eyes looking at Nia for a moment‐she slowly nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Alright. If Nia-san wishes to do this, please go ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un. Then‐come out, 'Rasiel'."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, as Nia raised her hand, a book with a bright glow appeared. Opening the book, Nia muttered something as her finger was on the page of the book. "……Kurumin……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if her eyes caught on something unbelievable, Nia gazed back at Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. What's the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other hand, Kurumi's response was extremely calm. With a gentle smile, she returned Nia's gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Kurumi look like this, Nia let out a small sigh. "……You are also a person with a wicked personality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi gave an ambiguous laugh in response to Nia's reply. Seeing this exchange between those two, Kotori raised her eyebrows in suspicion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What. What did you see, Nia?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Um, unfortunately, what Kurumin says is true. What we can do now is probably only that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, pray that things go well for boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Nia's answer somewhat deviated from the intentions of Kotori's question‐her expression told people that she wouldn't answer any further questions. Her usual cheerful tone felt like a lie, like full of subtle confusion but also with a quiet and strong will. ‐It may be rude to say this, but it felt like Nia was acting like an adult for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But very quickly, Nia bounced back as she clapped her hands together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Alright! Let's decide on the rules. For the time being, what location would be best?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. In the surrounding area, 'we' will clear the field to prevent bystanders from entering. There won't be any concerns of any neighbors wandering astray. ‐In principle, the battle should be carried out by the appearance of an Angel or Astral Dress. Why don't we make the elimination condition for those with reiryoku exhausted to the point where those two can't appear anymore? Of course, since the purpose is to release reiryoku, it goes without saying that attacking an unprotected opponent is not allowed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyah! Being intelligent and component aren't qualities that should match, Kurumin!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While whistling, Nia exaggeratingly stretched her body backwards. The surrounding atmosphere was slightly eased by Nia's comical appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Alright, enough, I understand. If this is the only way, I'll go along with this. ‐But there is one problem. " "What is the issue?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Sorry, but my Sephira Crystal has a bit of a property defect. When using my power for a</p>
<p class="null-p">long period, my entire body will be swallowed by destructive impulses and I'll lose my ability to discern. It wouldn't be wise to have a person in the middle of the game actually try to kill the others."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori said while shrugging, Kurumi smiled as if already anticipating this concern. "Don't worry about that. ‐At the very least, don't worry about this in this world." Kurumi spoke while exaggeratingly raising her right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in line with that movement, the shadows spread around her feet entangled around her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Astral Dress. The absolute armor and castle protecting a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moreover, the form was a bit different. A gothic Lolita dress decorated with the same ornaments as a nun. To describe it bluntly, it was the complete Astral Dress that Kurumi had manifested during the end of the conflict with Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be……a full Astral Dress? Then you've‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">With vigilance look, Kotori's eyes turned sharp. The Spirits who've had their reiryoku sealed by Shidou should basically only be able to manifest a limited Astral Dress. However, the dense reiryoku emitted from the dress Kurumi was wearing was clearly that of a perfect Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, don't give me that scary look. This isn't my doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone else should also be able to summon a complete Astral Dress if they tried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Kotori asked in amazement, Kurumi took a light step forward as she replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This world is a perfect distorted fantasy world created by Tohkasan. A gentle world where Mana-san's body has been completely cured and Sawa-san has been brought back to life. All the rules for this world have been modified conveniently for us. ‐It has also been confirmed through 'Rasiel' that Kotori-san's destructive impulses have been eliminated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori squinted while raising her arms up. Then, in order to confirm their intentions, she looked around to the faces of each of the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐So it's like this. Everyone, will you cooperate?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Kotori, the Spirits all made a collective powerful nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, of course……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. For Nushi-sama and Tohka, there is no reason to refuse." "Let's see. So it's forbidden to attack anyone who can't summon their Astral Dress or Angel, but is it okay to take care of them?</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, Yoshino, and Mukuro all agreed while Miku seemed to be shaking her body a little too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori smiled bitterly, the Yamai sister also raised the corners of their lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe. This matter is interesting in of itself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. Who is the strongest among the Spirits‐it would be a lie not to care about that matter."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kaguya and Yuzuru crossed gazes with each other. Their eyes were lit with a</p>
<p class="null-p">brilliant radiance filled with inquisitiveness of the imminent battle."</p>
<p class="null-p">In any case, despite the different motivations, everyone reached a consensus. In order to formulate more detailed rules, everyone looked back to Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at that moment, Natsumi weakly raised her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Umm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, what's the matter, Natsumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I have no issue about releasing my reiryoku to help this world survive……but I am absolutely weak so I would like not to fight if possible……is there a more peaceful way? Is it okay to shoot out our reiryoku little by little……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi spoke while shrinking back her shoulders in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, after all, not everyone was as competitive as the Yamai sisters. It would normal for this opinion to come forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, listening to Natsumi, Kurumi shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ah, that won't do. I won't be able to squeeze out my reiryoku to the limit in such a manner as if being immersed in lukewarm water. Besides‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Besides?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't boring to just do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you're finally telling the truth you brute……! If it was only to disperse out reiryoku, there</p>
<p class="null-p">would be no need to do something as dangerous as that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi screamed while tearing apart the sides of her hair. However, Kurumi didn't care about that as she said, "please give up that request of yours", in a cheerful tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But……what Natsumi-san says does hold some truth. " "Eh?" "Even though it's for the grandiose sake of saving the world,</p>
<p class="null-p">everyone does have a good</p>
<p class="null-p">relationship with each other. There may be the possibility of people holding back. In order to truly clash Angels, it may be necessary to have another motivation</p>
<p class="null-p">or a certain factor that stimulates the heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. If you want to describe it, it would be a 'reward'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi spoke while raising a single finger. The Spirits, led by the</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai sisters who let out a</p>
<p class="null-p">"ho……?" sound, all narrowed their eyes in interest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reward……ah. What would be good for a reward? If 'Ratatoskr' can help prepare, I can arrange that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu. There's no need to bother Kotori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said as her lips smiled from feeling enjoyment from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right‐'the right to confess her love to Shidou-san', how about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to what Kurumi had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits all widened their eyes at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As far as I know, no one has properly conveyed their feelings to Shidou-san. ‐In that case,</p>
<p class="null-p">isn't this the perfect opportunity? Even if you receive any kind of response, having the opportunity to confess means being one step ahead of anyone else towards Shidou-san, who has always been vague about these matters. Surely, this must be sufficient enough to gamble one's life in order to win?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits all silently exchanges glances as they all swallowed in their breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To Shidou……a confession?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Earlier than anyone else‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……If you lose‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someone who's not me to Shidou‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no need for words anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">The atmosphere was clear, but there was a quiet but raging fire lit in each Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">After sensing everyone's high spirits, Nia distorted her cheeks, whistling as if to proclaim the outbreak of war.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Hyah, it seems that everyone is properly motivated? Boy and</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka are already taking action‐so let's also have a nice war?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this manner, perhaps to the largest battle between Spirits‐the curtain had risen.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Fragmentary Chapter 3: Despair</p>
<p class="null-p">Despair had rushed in.</p>
<p class="null-p">A wave of volatile emotions that could only be described in this manner had struck her.</p>
<p class="null-p">()</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past, her other self's emotions have been strongly shaken before. She was already aware of the feeling of fierce sorrow crossing over and the extreme wrath that had been carelessly forgotten by herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, those were feelings well within the limit of being controllable. In fact, these emotions were quickly absorbed into her other self as her body began to sound a gentle melody of calm emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this time it was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was the feeling of a crack in her other self's existence. Like the loss of all of the happiness enjoyed so far. Even during the past that was dominated by fear and sorrow, there wasn't such strong despair felt. What had happened to her other self‐</p>
<p class="null-p">(……)</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, she noticed one thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">The heart of her other self. Until now she could only sense it vaguely, but gradually the image became clearer.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, she understood. ‐Her other self had fallen into the area where she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">()</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't help but reach out. To be precise, she was inclined to consciously reach out her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, her hand‐a hand that hadn't touch anything for such a long time, had felt something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, this was the hand. She understood the moment she touched it. She could hold onto the hand of her other self now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It was like exchanging control of their body with her other self, the feeling of her own</p>
<p class="null-p">consciousness rising to the surface‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">After such a long time, she looked at the world through her own eyes, heard sounds with her own ears, and even felt the wind against her skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">What she saw in front of her was completely different scenery than what she had seen before. A dark room. A robust building. There wasn't the appearance of the Spirit that had given birth to her, but instead several humans had surrounded her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Where is here."</p>
<p class="null-p">She spoke softly. Her throat which had not spoken for long time felt a slight hoarse pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyebrows furrowed in displeasure‐at the same time, she gradually thought it over. Until now, her other self was in this body. The fact that she had appeared in this world meant they had traded places.</p>
<p class="null-p">And‐the other me was feeling deep, deep, despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked at the people here and decided on her next move. ‐Outrage. With that in mind, she would violently sweep away these obstructive thoughts from her other self. Someone among these numbers or all of them had caused her other self to experience such despair. If so, she could never forgive them. She would mow them all down to restore that peace.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐there was a strange man among them.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was a man who did nothing but strange actions. He was clearly facing her, but there wasn't</p>
<p class="null-p">any hostility. He was calling out to her through something resembling a name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally‐as she was prepared to bring down her sword; he pressed his lips against her own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……you bast‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she fell into hysterical astonishment, she felt her consciousness be brought back to her original place.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: Spirit War</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Fufufufu, fufufu, fu‐fufu♪"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was walking along the main street of Tenguu City, accompanied by Tohka who was humming a pleasant song.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know if this was due to spring break starting since yesterday, but it was a bit more crowded than usual even though it was before noontime. The sunshine felt soft as the spring breeze was warm. On the front of a store, there was poster at the center written about supporting a new life. Whether he liked it or not, he could feel the arrival of a new season of both encounters and separations.</p>
<p class="null-p">While walking along the street, Tohka was dressed in a light coat and a long skirt with colors matching springtime. After waiting for about 30 minutes for Tohka to dry her hair and change clothes, she had transformed into an elegant lady.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching this exceedingly natural event, Shidou suddenly remembered a mysterious feeling. After all, when she first entered the Spirit mansion, she first mistakenly thought the hair drier was some sort of weapon. At the same time the warm air blew out, a reversal in the flow of reiryoku had occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, on the contrary, she even wore clothes very strangely at first. Wearing a shirt upside down in the beginning, she mistook a belt for a weapon thrown to shatter glass, or even as something worn over sports pants.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was only a small glimpse of the entire picture. Tohka's life as a human being was a series of</p>
<p class="null-p">hardships. For her, it was like being thrown into a world where nothing was known. Despite</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ratatoskr's support, there were still many things that she was confused about.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tohka had no fear of mistakes or repeated blunders. She thoroughly enjoyed the learning process for this unknown world. ‐Shidou, who would smiled wryly at her comical blunders, didn't know when he started to respect her great efforts.</p>
<p class="null-p">……It was probably because of Tohka's cheerfulness that he remembered this sort of thing. Shidou scratched his cheek as he watched Tohka merrily walk next to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how he looked at it, this was the usual Tohka. At the very least, he didn't think it was inverse Tohka acting. It was inverse Tohka who had taken away Mio's Sephira Crystal. That was likely correct. But as long as they shared the same body, he should be able to seal that reiryoku by kissing Tohka. But‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, hearing his name being called out, Shidou felt a jolt reach his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-ooh, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even in the current situation, it was strictly forbidden to be so deeply lost in his thoughts that he would leave a girl alone during a date. Shidou replied back while trying to fake excitement in his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tohka didn't seem to worry about this as she pointed to the front with a nostalgic expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you remember? It was nearby here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told this, Shidou looked towards the direction indicated by Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was nothing special there. It was just a street. There were no food places that Tohka would have liked nor any monuments designed to attract attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou thought about it for a while but he still couldn't think of anything. Shidou turned to</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka with an apologetic look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Sorry. Did something happen here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, have you forgotten? ‐No, I don't blame you. After all, the roads and buildings were all broken at that time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Tohka had said, Shidou looked at his surroundings again‐briefly letting out a 'ah' sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be……is this where I met Tohka for the first time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. April 10th of last year. Shidou, who had not known about Spirits or 'Ratatoskr', had come here.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the spacequake alarmed went off, he discovered that Kotori's cell phone GPS positioning was still in the town. While running through the uninhabited street‐he met a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Here was where everything began. This was a street where everything had changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, so you did remember!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka let out a cheerful voice. She stared into the distance like this, watching the street where people came and went.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Time flies by so fast……has it been almost a year since then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou took a deep breath as he looked onto the street just like Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">One year ago. In such a short period of time, it can be said that Shidou's life had turned on its head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, to be precise, he was already connected to the Spirits before than‐but it was the first time that Shidou had encountered a Spirit besides Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was thinking that over, Tohka suddenly rushed ahead of him. Then, she sharpened her eyes as she made a pose as if lifting up a sword. "‐You as well……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Pff……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Tohka had abruptly said, Shidou let out a light laugh. But as soon as he realized</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's intentions, he swayed weakly backwards. "‐You, are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Name. ‐I don't have one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After exchanging those words, a short silence lasted for a while‐ "…………Pff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fufu, hahaha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon after, it wasn't clear who started it first, but it became unbearable to not laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because they were laughing in the middle of the street, the pedestrians nearby gave them strange looks. But Shidou and Tohka couldn't stop laughing for a while. After laughing for a while, they finally began to adjust their breathing while lowering their shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you do this so suddenly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, so you remember it as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I remember‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Shidou was wiping away the tears from laughing, he looked towards Tohka again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The events of that day could be recalled as if it were yesterday. That day was the starting point where he began to become associated with Spirits, 'Ratatoskr', AST‐and most importantly, that abrupt encounter with a girl who had asked if he had come to kill her. Even if he had forgotten everything else, he would never forget that.</p>
<p class="null-p">And above all else‐the sad expression of that girl left an impact on his heart for a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou once thought about it. He didn't want her to show that expression. Thinking now, that</p>
<p class="null-p">may have been the driving force behind why he continued to help the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who looked like she about to cry at any time was now smiling happily right in front of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">That alone made Shidou felt that there was nothing worth replacing in this year. Shidou suddenly lowered his gaze as he sighed lightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Tohka pulled on Shidou's sleeve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Shidou. This opportunity is rare. I have a place I want to go, can you accompany me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Of course I can……but where do you want to go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu……you'll find out on the way there."</p>
<p class="null-p">While listening to Shidou, Tohka gave a mischievous smile.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐,‐,‐,‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami exhaled out several times, alternating between thin and long breaths.</p>
<p class="null-p">Breathing wasn't just an act of getting oxygen into the body.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example, it could be used for concentration. Even during ancient and modern martial arts, there were many cases of breathing being used to increase mental concentration. Among that, there were special breathing techniques used to disperse pain or even increase the power of a single blow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was now standing in a small grove located in the western end of the nature park. In- between the sparse trees, she sat above a pile of fallen leaves while calming her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mind was as clear as the surface of water. By breathing, she imagined tiny droplets forming ripples on the surface of the water.</p>
<p class="null-p">The surface of water without ripples was beautiful, but it was akin to death. When alive a person's heart would shake at the slightest stimulation. Forcibly trying to suppress this was not strength. Rather, that would be tantamount to saying that one could stand to handle the disorder.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, instead of trying to create a perfect surface, she accepted the mental image of the ripples. Before the battle, Origami tried to concentrate her mind like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when she was a part of AST.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when she fought against DEM as a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">And‐now as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't know how long she stood like this, but finally the bell signaling 12 o'clock for the park rang.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Ehyeh'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the bell, Origami stood up, opening her eyes while whispering that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as she said that, Origami's entire body was covered with light‐a white radiance as an</p>
<p class="null-p">Astral Dress in the shape of a wedding dress formed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see, certainly a complete Astral Dress has manifested."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami muttered to herself alone as she lowered her head to look at the pure white clothes covering her body as armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's been an hour now since all of the Spirits were called by Kurumi to gather in the park.</p>
<p class="null-p">After defining the rules of the battle, the Spirits scattered all around the nature park.</p>
<p class="null-p">The range was this nature park. Time was unlimited. They were free to move around this park, but any encounter meant having to fight on the spot. The Spirits that were unable to summon an Astral Dress or Angel were eliminated‐the winner would be the last person standing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. This idyllic nature park had now transformed into a dangerous battlefield where ten natural disasters had gathered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami narrowed her eyes as she analyzed the combat strength of each Spirit in her mind. Of course, not a single one was an opponent she could lower her guard to.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Natsumi, Miku, and Nia may be one step inferior in direct firepower. But this was not a one on one battle, but rather a battle royal taking place over a vast area. It was completely unclear when an attack from Natsumi, who could transform freely, would occur. Since there was the possibility of fighting together, Miku's 'Gabriel' was also a threat. As for Nia, she must have grasped everyone's movements already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Were the Yamai sisters planning on fighting as a team or individually? In any case, their speed couldn't be ignored. Among the Spirits, few had as strong of a defense as Yoshino. She was also a contender depending on how the battle progressed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……But."</p>
<p class="null-p">The most dangerous was the remaining three. Origami clenched her fist as she strengthened her guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first one was Mukuro. The power of her Angel 'Michael' was particularly distinguished even among several Angels. If acted rashly, the outcome of the match may be decided in a single blow. It was also not easy to deal with her appearing anywhere through a 'hole' opened in space.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it wasn't as if there were no opportunities that could be advantageous. Her personality meant that she would likely not resort to such cowardice means on her opponent. Because the purpose of this battle was to release their reiryoku to the limit, she couldn't seal her opponents' power with 'Segva' to finish things immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that regard, Kurumi was the more troublesome one in this battle. She could control time with</p>
<p class="null-p">'Zafkiel', create numerous clones, as well as track Origami's</p>
<p class="null-p">movements with 'Rasiel' just</p>
<p class="null-p">like Nia. Moreover, because of her personality, she didn't expect any opportunities for openings like with Mukuro. If possible, Origami hoped that Kurumi would take herself out with someone else before encountering her, but‐ "…………No."</p>
<p class="null-p">After thinking it over, Origami shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a battle royal. And since the winner would be given the right to confess to Shidou, she absolutely couldn't lose.</p>
<p class="null-p">But as a premise‐it was also a battle was also to help Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was natural to want to save strength, but it made no sense here. Even if she obtained victory as a result of escaping the battle, Origami didn't feel she could properly convey her feelings to Shidou this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, although it was a bit uncomfortable that this was also to help</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Tohka's date‐ "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Origami's eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. A Spirit had appeared in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ara, how do you do, Origami. It's such a coincidence to meet up at such a location."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, a small girl wearing a kimono-like Astral Dress said in a brisk tone as she descended down from the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had two horns like an oni. Her angel's raiment was reminiscent of that worn by a heavenly woman. ‐And also a crimson flame was covering her entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Kotori."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami inadvertently lowered her posture as she called out that name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The commander of 'Ratatoskr' as well as Shidou's little sister. Itsuka Kotori had come here while wearing a complete Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was among the three dangerous Spirits that Kotori listed in her mind earlier. ‐The last one. Now that Tohka isn't here, perhaps she is the only Spirit that can compete with Origami in terms of raw firepower.</p>
<p class="null-p">Additionally, if what Kurumi said was correct, her only weakness, the destructive impulses eroding away her mind, had disappeared. That is to say, the current Kotori, for the first time since becoming a Spirit, could exercise her power without any restrictions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who had crossed blades with her before the world had been altered, painfully understood how terrifying that was.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Metatron'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami quietly chanted that name while sharpening her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if responding to that, several angel feathers appeared from the void and formed a circle above her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's power was certainly immense. But Origami was also different from last time. She kicked off the ground, floating to the same position as Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori perceived Origami's intentions, smirked from enjoyment as she raised her right hand. "'Camael'."</p>
<p class="null-p">As she said that, a huge battle axe weaved with flames. ‐The angel</p>
<p class="null-p">'Camael'. The flames of the angel that Kotori carried could turn everything to ashes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This truly must be fate in our relationship. Even after becoming friends, to think we would face off against each other once again." Kotori breathed out a small sigh to complain before smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I'm never the type to be lenient. Give it all you got, novice</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirit-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐As you wish."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami succinctly answered as she lifted both hands‐directing the muzzle of 'Metatron' at Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes after the clock struck 12 to signal the beginning of the war, there was a loud explosion at the west side of the park.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A roar shook both the air and earth. A flash of light was seen coming from between the trees, as all of the surroundings birds fled at once. Yoshino, who was hiding in the athletic facilities, reflexively cowered her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiyah‐that was a sudden display of strength. Was that Origami just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The rabbit puppet "Yoshinon" on Yoshino's left hand spoke as it dexterously stroked its chin with its short paw. Yoshino, frightened by the direction that sound came from, was at a complete loss as she fell towards facing front ahead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure enough……very powerful. If struck by that attack……" As Yoshino muttered like that, her body began to tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">Needless to say, Yoshino was also wearing a complete Astral Dress. In contrast to its pretty appearance, the rabbit eared hoody reminiscent of a raincoat boasted a solid defense that it wouldn't be damaged even by tank fire.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even with that, the firepower from 'Metatron' was overwhelming. After all, it was easily able to pierce Tohka's Astral Dress, which boasted an even sturdier defense than Yoshino's. If she was discovered, even an ice wall created by 'Zadkiel' would be erased in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what should I do, Yoshinon……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, let's calm down, Yoshino. This is a battle royal. There's no need to approach a strong</p>
<p class="null-p">opponent and fight. First of all, look for an opponent that you can defeat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look for opponents that can be defeated……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. ……Well, everyone is strong though. Origami-chan is as you just saw. Kotori-chan has super firepower and recovery. The effects of Miku-chan's songs are also difficult to deal with. It'll be impossible to catch up to Kaguya-chan and Yuzuru-chan first anyhow. Mukuro- chan's powers are a super-cheat. Natsumi-chan can imitate any Angel. Kurumi-chan has two Angels. And Nia-chan is very good at drawing manga."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon spoke with a smile, "Damn, it's real headache". Yoshino wrinkled her brow into the shape of a "八" character as she dejectedly sat down on that spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure enough……there isn't an opponent I can fight against. At the very least, for the sake of</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou-san and Tohka-san's date, I want to use as much reiryoku as possible……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey there!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Yoshino felt a soft touch on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon had struck a light-speed rabbit punch to interrupt Yoshino from speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshinon……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the use of giving up before even starting, Yoshino! If you act like this, you won't even overcome the opponents you could have won against!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-but……everyone is so strong, I'm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino anxiously spoke, Yoshinon's hands spread out as it shook its head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, let's put the discussion of strength and weakness aside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino, what do you think of Shidou-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the sudden question issued, Yoshino rounded her eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what I think……um……I think he is a very nice person, I'm very grateful to him. If Shidou- san didn't help me, I wouldn't be living this life right now or met everyone……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes, that's right. ‐So, do you like him? Or hate him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Umm……I……like……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino replied as she lowered her deeply blushing face. Yoshino then agilely folded its arms while nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. That's true. ‐So, the child that wins this battle can confess to Shidou-kun. Well,</p>
<p class="null-p">although the 'right to confess' is awfully suspicious, it's because that everyone gets along that</p>
<p class="null-p">they want to preserve this relationship for better or for worse." Yoshinon interjected a "but" while raising its face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is going to collapse with Kurumi-chan's suggestion. Of course, if someone confesses,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou-kun won't necessarily accept it……but the possibility isn't zero, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino's lips were shaking as she spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino was very fond of her life right now. There was Shidou, Kotori, the other Spirits; she liked it so much that she smiled happily every day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, as time passed, everyone and the environment around them would change little by little. It goes without saying the transition from going to school to employment, but the minor changes were endless. As long as they lived like humans, this must be inevitable.</p>
<p class="null-p">One day, Shidou will marry someone. That someone may be a person among the Spirits or perhaps somebody they haven't met yet. If it becomes like that, the relationship so far cannot be maintained. Because Shidou will have a loving partner‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant that imagination surfaced in her mind, Yoshino felt a sharp pain coming from her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………I don't want……I don't want that to happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino squeezed out her trembling voice. She hadn't noticed it until being told by Yoshinon.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt so painful that Shidou would love one person specifically. It felt so painful not being the one next to Shidou's side.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐there was an even stronger feeling turning about in her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Yoshino conveyed her feelings to Shidou, Shidou wouldn't necessarily respond positively.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, once more, the idea that her fond feelings for Shidou will never be conveyed so that someone else can monopolize him‐that was absolutely detestable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Alright, well said! That's why Yoshino!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon pressed both hands against her eyes, as if to wipe away the tears leaked from Yoshino's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not a matter of whether you can win or not. Girls have times when they need to fight!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After blinking a few times, Yoshino gave an affirmative nod. Then Yoshinon gently opened its mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Okay, as for the specific method now. Since this is combat, I think it would better to hide while everyone else crush each other. It's more delicious to snatch away victory at the very end‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshinon……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a complete turnover from her hot-blood approach from beforehand. Seeing Yoshinon give off such a devious proposal, Yoshino couldn't help but force a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very next moment‐ "'Gabriel'‐'Rondo'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Yoshino, watch out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Yoshino leaped on reflex in response to Yoshinon's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next instant, several silver-like metal pipes manifested behind the athletic facilities Yoshino was hiding, releasing out a terrifying sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino felt a bead of sweat drip down her cheek. If she had jumped just a little bit later, her body would have been bounded by the sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was only one Spirit who could pull off such a trick. At the same time Yoshino landed, she turned to the direction of that sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku-san……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yoshino called out her name, Miku, whom Yoshino didn't how long she was standing</p>
<p class="null-p">there, twisted her body in frustration as her Astral Dress swayed like a stage costume.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. It's such a pity. Just a little bit more‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really‐we already can't be caught off guard."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Yoshinon moved its hands as if to shrug.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Now Yoshino, it's the first match right away. Are you prepared?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Yoshinon had said,</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino strongly nodded.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey? The place you said you wanted to go……is it here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After 30 minutes of walking while being pulled by Tohka, Shidou looked up to the building that they arrived at and unexpectedly widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no wonder. After all, this was‐ "Umu‐the school."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka smiled while nodding in satisfaction. ‐Yes. The place that Tohka had brought him was the Raizen High School that they all went to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why? Isn't this a place where we usually go to? Speaking of which, just the day before yesterday‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, hurry in."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka pulled on his arm as she walked in. It appeared that she didn't want to him to say anything more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait a minute……"</p>
<p class="null-p">If Tohka desired so strongly, there was no reason to decline. But right now was during the time of spring break. In fact, the main gate in front of the school building was tightly closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, let's go through the side door. If we tell them that we've come to pick something up from school, they'll probably let us in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, then let's do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou took Tohka and entered the campus from the side gate. After completing some easy procedures, they walked to the interior of the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of having indoor shoes, they were wearing slippers prepared for visitors. Accompanied by the swishing sound from the slippers, they walked through a corridor with nobody present.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow it was a mysterious feeling. Although it was a place that they usually went every weekday, just because there was no one here, it felt as if they were lost in a strange space.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it seemed that Tohka's goal was not to enjoy this extraordinary feeling. She was walking very proudly in this unmanned teaching facility at a steady pace that told others there was clear destination ahead.</p>
<p class="null-p">After walking up the stairs, Tohka finally stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">She stood right in front of classroom 204, Shidou's homeroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Fufu, how nostalgic."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Tohka entered the classroom, walking between the desks at a slow pace.</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to those words, Shidou looked on in confusion. This place was the familiar school and classroom where they had spent a considerable amount of time at. Shidou thought that the word 'nostalgic' didn't seem appropriate.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, while looking at the quiet classroom with only two people‐Shidou once again saw that scene appear in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. If the street visited earlier was where he first met Tohka, then this place was where,</p>
<p class="null-p">after being appointed to interact with the Spirits by 'Ratatoskr', Shidou reunited with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">During that time, there were no students in the classroom because the spacequake alarm had gone off. The scene from that time was no different from the quiet classroom now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noticing Shidou's expression, Tohka loosened her lips to speak while moving towards the blackboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you remember? ‐Up here."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said so while picking up some white chalk to write some words on the blackboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was her name. The two characters for Tohka. "This is the place where you let me become me."</p>
<p class="null-p">While staring into Shidou's eyes, Tohka smiled sweetly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, that's right. Tohka. She was given her name to her by Shidou during that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou gave the nameless me a name. I don't know how many times that name has saved me. I'm really‐grateful to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, actually I……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was being stared directly at Tohka while she said that, Shidou scratched his face in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that the name was given to her by him, and it was more than anything good that Tohka was so fond of it……but the origin of that name was very simple. Just because "the first time we met was on April 10th".</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that was unavoidable. In such an extreme state and crunched for time, there was no way he could have come up with a fancy name.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Well, when considering that Takamiya Shinji gave the name</p>
<p class="null-p">'Mio' to a girl he met on the</p>
<p class="null-p">30th; he couldn't deny that this might be an instinct that he was born with.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, regardless of the origin, he couldn't imagine her name of being anything else besides 'Tohka'. The days spent with her during the past year have vividly engraved the name 'Tohka' onto 'Tohka'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the moment, he realized this, Shidou was struck by a feeling of his heart tightening.</p>
<p class="null-p">The street where he first encountered Tohka. And now also the classroom where he had given Tohka her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was reliving the experience of encountering Tohka through today's path. He couldn't help but feel uneasy from this.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as though Tohka had foreseen her own death‐somehow.</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew he was likely overthinking it. It must be because they have come across so much that Tohka felt nostalgic and wanted to come to this classroom again.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if left alone, that disturbing fantasy may become reality. Shidou took a deep breath before speaking to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu. What is it Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka widened his eyes at Shidou's unexpected words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made up his mind as he opened his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen to me, actually‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in the classroom with only the two of them, Shidou told her the truth. He told Tohka that there was another Tohka in her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">He told Tohka that Mio's Sephira Crystal was taken away by this Tohka and used to create this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">And‐as it stood, Tohka would likely die along with this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to that, Tohka let out her voice while opening her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Another person inside me……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes. It may sound unbelievable, but this isn't a lie or a joke, please trust me."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou finished speaking, Tohka shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Idiot. I can't doubt what Shidou says. And‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka narrowed her eyes while placing her hand against her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Another me. It's vague……but not unthinkable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that true?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu. Whenever I feel painful or desperate‐a fearful and dependable existence seems to be here with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tohka put her hand down and looked up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……But even so, I completely don't know what to do. Sure enough, everyone must be guessing that we have to let her out and seal her power?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……To be honest, I don't know either. Actually, even if we can, I don't know how to make the other Tohka show up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka revealed a complex expression while crossing her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is it true that Mio's Sephira is within my body? And the other me, with that power, reshaped the world……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, that should be true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, then……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka was saying that, she pressed her hands together, wrinkling her brow and humming out</p>
<p class="null-p">an "hmmmmmmmm" sound as if in prayer. "T-tohka……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Waaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Tohka vigorously open her eyes and screamed. Shidou couldn't help but feel his body tremble from the sudden noise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Muu, is it no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a brief silence, Tohka let out a regretful sigh, putting down her hands that were pressed together in prayer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what did you try to do just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I thought that since Mio's Sephira Crystal is in my body, I could use that power as well. So</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to pray 'other me, come out!' and make that happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka said that she looked down at her own body, repeatedly tightening and loosening her hand. ……It looked completely unchanged. In other words, it was clear from the way she was speaking just now that the other personality hadn't surfaced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……well, it can't be that easy…….right?" Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou forced a smile while scratching his cheek, he suddenly stopped his words involuntarily.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Tohka's body gave off a faint glow, slowly that light escape from Tohka's body‐gradually taking the shape of a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-this is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! What……"</p>
<p class="null-p">To both Shidou and Tohka's surprise, the light finally turned into the figure of a girl which appeared here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hair the color of the night and a pair of crystal-like eyes. Clad in an Astral Dress that was a fusion of a dark knight's armor and a dress‐the light had turned into a girl that looked identical to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl‐inverse Tohka gently opened her eyes, frowning in suspicion as she stared at Shidou who was right in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Human, what did you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tone was brimming with danger as she didn't conceal her murderous intent. Faced with the overwhelming pressure that would cause a small animal to suffocate on the spot, Shidou took a step back in vain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no, I haven't done anything……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't screw around with me. It's impossible for me to show up here without doing anything. If you are intending to hide‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, inverse Tohka was no longer speaking. No‐to be more precise, she was stopped immediately by Tohka's voice coming from the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you are the other me! The first time meeting……that doesn't sound entirely right, correct?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Inverse Tohka's shoulders were grabbed by Tohka, she gave a confused look for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tohka didn't seem to care about this as she continued to speak with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, I made a wish for the other me to show up, but I didn't expect you to show up this way. You definitely are the splitting image of me……but I also feel that something is a little different. Could it be the way you tie your hair?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a minute……wait a minute."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse Tohka, who was pressed by Tohka's momentum, spread out her palms to rein Tohka back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does this mean? Why have I separated from Tohka? ……No way, could you have used that woman's power to incarnate me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand quite well, but perhaps that is it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Confronted by Tohka's smile, inverse Tohka fell silent. Judging from her expression, she likely didn't consider it was possible to meet with Tohka in such a manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What a waste. I'm heading back. You go play alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Wait……wait a minute!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As inverse Tohka closed her eyes in preparation to return, Shidou turned his voice inside out to challenge that notion.</p>
<p class="null-p">He gained the chance to see inverse Tohka outside of Tohka's body, he couldn't miss this opportunity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What. Do you want to be killed trying to stop me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no, that's not it……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Facing inverse Tohka's glare, Shidou couldn't help but wince. He can't afford to let inverse Tohka escape now. However, he also had no idea what to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">From a single mistake, inverse Tohka would disappear again into Tohka's body. On the contrary,</p>
<p class="null-p">a bad decision would mean perhaps being killed. Was there any correct method……?</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, as Shidou was trying to think up something, Tohka raised her voice as if coming up with something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hear me out! Other me, I am on a date with Shidou right now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As inverse Tohka faintly narrowed her eyes, Tohka grabbed her hands while her eyes were still sparkling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it is possible, won't you come along with me? I'm sure it will be fun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Tohka's words, Shidou saw a flash of inspiration as he clenched his fist. "Great idea Tohka! Me, Tohka, and you, let's go on a date with all three of us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know if Tohka realized this, but her request had led to the optimal solution.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, it was preferable to have a one-on-one date with a Spirit. However, Tohka and inverse Tohka seemed to be two people that share the same existence‐but above all, inverse Tohka's attitude towards Tohka seemed softer than it was for Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse Tohka scowled at Shidou with enough murderous intent comparable to shooting someone to death.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is your date with Tohka. Only the two of you need to go.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't involve me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse Tohka shook off Tohka's hands. Then, Tohka suddenly gave a sad look. "Is it……no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse Tohka gave a troubled look inconsistent with a Spirit with absolute control over the world. Seeing this situation, Shidou unintentionally loosened his cheeks to smile a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is there anything funny? Do you want to die, human?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no……sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sure enough, unlike to Tohka, her attitude towards Shidou was more ruthless. He gently lowered his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, inverse Tohka, after staring at Shidou for a while, let out of</p>
<p class="null-p">'tch" sound from her mouth and sighed as if giving up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It can't be helped. I'll accompany you for just a little."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to inverse Tohka's reply, Tohka's face brightened up as she once again grabbed</p>
<p class="null-p">inverse Tohka's hands. Seeing inverse Tohka's appearance as this was being done, Shidou was about to smile again‐but confronted by inverse Tohka's glare, he quickly covered his mouth with his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse Tohka huffed from her nose in displeasure as she lowered her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, her Astral Dress gave a light shine as it transformed into an ordinary dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, compared to Tohka who was dressed to match the springtime, Inverse Tohka wore the same dress in an elegant black style.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, it's very beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. Although there's absolutely no need to change clothes when walking in my own world‐well, for Tohka's sake, I've still replaced the clothes to match your way of doing things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……I feel honored."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't laugh. I'll kill you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, 'me' don't say that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being scolded by Tohka, inverse Tohka closed her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">From her strangely amusing appearance, Shidou had to resist the urge to laugh as he raised his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-anyway……I'll be in your care. Uhh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">While scratching his cheeks, Shidou said up to this‐before suddenly coming to halt. The reason was simple. He didn't know what to call her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, she had simply been called 'Tohka' or 'inverse Tohka'. But now that she had a body separate from Tohka, this seemed a bit inappropriate.</p>
<p class="null-p">His thoughts being grasped from his expression, inverse Tohka snorted again from her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Name. Certainly, you were the bastard who gave Tohka her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Very well, I'll entrust this to you. Call me whatever you like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to this, Shidou was left speechless. Unexpectedly, after Tohka, even inverse Tohka had come to him asking for a name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moreover, Tohka was looking at him with an eager expression, as if wanting to say "Ooh, that's a great idea!" in anticipation. The pressure now hadn't eased in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……uhh……then……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou desperately thought hard‐ "‐Tenka……how about that?" After a few seconds, he said the name. Tohka clapped her hands in applause.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected of Shidou, it's a good name. How do you write it?" "Uh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being asked, Shidou grabbed the chalk and wrote the name 'Tenka' besides the name 'Tohka' on the blackboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that looks great!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka spoke, inverse Tohka‐Tenka gave a small huff from her nose while swaying her right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, traced by the trajectory of Tenka's fingertips, a huge scar was inscribed onto the blackboard. Shidou involuntary bended his body down and let out a 'wow!' sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Shidou thought that she wasn't satisfied with this name……but it didn't seem to be like that. Although the knife marks were distorted, looking closely it did indeed have the strokes for the two characters of 'Tenka'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm, it's not bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka said impatiently but there wasn't any sign of rejection in her tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was a name he came up on the spot, it seemed to be accepted by her for the time being. Shidou finally breathed out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">……This was simply an English pronunciation of the character '十' in '十香'‐quite literally it was supposed to mean 'Ten 香 ' ‐however, regardless of the name's origin, Shidou felt that it was necessary to take this secret to his grave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Tenka, I'm glad you're happy receiving that name, but we can't destroy the classroom. That would be troubling for everyone during class time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mu."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka finished saying that, Tenka slightly wrinkled her brow and snapped her fingers. Then, catering to the sound of the snap, the huge nicks on the blackboard were instantly fixed. "Ooh, how excellent Tenka."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka gently caressed the top of Tenka's head, Tenka gave an uncomfortable look as she brushed away the hand and then turned towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Do."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka folded her arms against each other while raising her chin to speak. Shidou, sensing the pleasing exchange between Tohka and Tenka, felt his shoulders slightly shake.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it didn't appear to be from what he expected. Tenka's eyes were not marked by anger or frustration, but rather a look that was evaluating Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said, you mentioned a date. But what the hell are we going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, I'm also concerned about this. We stopped by here because of my waywardness, but what do you want to do today, Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka's eyes gave a cold look while Tohka's eyes were sparkling. Shidou felt puzzled by the temperature difference in the aura of those two who had the same identical face. He coughed a few times to regain his composure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……today there's something that I wanted to show Tohka‐and</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou finished speaking, Tohka and Tenka gave a curious and suspicious look respectively.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya…..aaaaaaaaaaaaah‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi screamed a sad cry as she fled to the outer edge of the nature park.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was to be expected. After all, coming from behind‐ "‐Frustration. Trying to escape is not enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru, surrounding her body in a powerful gale, scraped down the surrounding trees as she quickly approached Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was like a self-aware tornado. As Yuzuru was trailing towards</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's back as the she was trying to escape, the landscape of the park had been greatly altered. The streetlights had been overcome by the wind, benches were fluttering about, and even the ground had been scooped up like a lifted carpet.</p>
<p class="null-p">This violent gale was not simply any ordinary wind. The angel 'Raphael' could create a windstorm of reiryoku that could be worn. For a Spirit like Natsumi that was not high in strength, she would be smash apart like a ragdoll the moment she got sucked in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say something so absurd ahhhh! Wouldn't anything ordinary drop dead from that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi screamed while cursing her bad luck. As soon as the signal to start the battle rang, she had been discovered by this storm lady.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Yuzuru usually gave a quiet and gentle expression, she was actually the most radical and militant among the Spirits. More precisely, it could be said that she enjoyed competing with others. Since usually her eyes are placed of Kaguya, Natsumi never noticed very much. But now Natsumi could only realize this fear while on the battlefield for the first time against her,</p>
<p class="null-p">However, continuing to run away would mean eventually being caught and turned into broken cleaning rag. Natsumi ran away desperately while shouting loud enough to feel her own throat be crushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha, 'Haniel'‐'Kaleidoscope'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if responding to that voice, the broom Angel 'Haniel' in Natsumi's hands gave of a radiant</p>
<p class="null-p">glow, causing it to change appearance and transform into the huge sword</p>
<p class="null-p">Angel‐'Sandalphon'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The Angel 'Haniel' could imitate the shapes and powers of other Angels.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi grasped the handle with both arms, turning the direction of her body and using that momentum to swing 'Haniel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">The trajectory of light from the swing cut through the gale surrounding Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reaction. Fu‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yuzuru turned around just as the slash reached her, avoiding it in the nick of time. Even the wall of wind that had been torn apart was easily restored in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Useless. Although that sword swing was quite good just now, something of that level cannot defeat Yuzuru."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've got to be kidding me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi rounded her eyes as she continued to desperately try to flee from this tornado again.</p>
<p class="null-p">While she was in the process of escaping from the tornado, Natsumi changed 'Haniel's form to counterattack. However, every attempt failed to reach Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Metatron's rays of light, as well as 'Camael's gunfire bombardment, even an attack from a</p>
<p class="null-p">blind spot from 'Michael', Yuzuru's superb defense and godly reflexes avoided them all.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was reasonable to expect. Even though 'Haniel' can imitate the powers of other Angels,</p>
<p class="null-p">it can't reproduce the original Angel's power 100%. Additionally, the user Natsumi likely had the lowest basic abilities among the Spirits. Against the average Wizard of AST or DEM, this was no issue, but naturally she couldn't stand a confrontation against another Spirit using her Angel to the limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, she was the ultimate jack of all trades. 'Haniel' is an Angel that relies on trickery planned in advance through exerting the most number of effects during the first battle. At the moment of falling into a direct confrontation with a Spirit, Natsumi had no chances of victory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gah…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps owing to fleeing in this park for so long, or being off guard due to reaching the limits of her stamina, Natsumi tripped on a tree root, tumbling onto the ground in a flashy manner. Her face fell directed onto the ground as she rolled around due to the inertia.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Yuzuru would never miss such an opportunity. The wind wrapped around Yuzuru's body</p>
<p class="null-p">swelled, spreading out from her hand to entrap Natsumi from every direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she raised her face while rubbing her bruised nose, Natsumi was already captured in the tornado created by Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How……how can this be……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Capture. You can't escape. Now, let's settle this match."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru set up her pendulum like Angel‐'Raphael' 'El Na'ash'.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them were in the eye of the typhoon. There was no wind in this spot, but the tremendous wind pressure was swirling around them. Natsumi had no means of escape. Without any hope, she held onto 'Haniel' with trembling hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Praise. Your attitude is admirable. ‐Now, I will proceed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hi…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the moment Yuzuru kicked against the sky while keeping her focus on Natsumi. "‐You're wide open‐!!" All of a sudden such a voice was heard as another tornado came down directly above the tornado created by Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Response. Ku‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru wrinkled her brow and twisted her body, covering herself with the length of 'El Na'ash' to protect from each direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">A moment later, Natsumi finally noticed. ‐The identity of the person who attacked Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ho, so you avoided it. But I won't praise you. Since you are my other half, you wouldn't have been defeated by an attack of that level!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A loud roar from above, a girl appeared with a smug smile. ‐Her appearance was identical to Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was Yuzuru's twin sister, the Spirit Kaguya who held the other half of Yuzuru's Angel had just attacked Yuzuru with the huge assault lance 'El Re'em'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Returning fire. It is surprising. Kaguya has chosen to save Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey! Don't misunderstand! I was just checking to make sure if Yuzuru will lower her guard in front of her prey. Besides‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya gave a faint smile while point the tip of ' El Re'em' towards Yuzuru. "‐When I defeat Yuzuru, I won't accept damage from other Spirits as an excuse!" Yuzuru loosened her mouth upon hearing what Kaguya had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pleasant. It seems that your sense of humor has improved since last time. ‐Very well, I will be your opponent. Natsumi wait until I defeat Kaguya‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Yuzuru rounded her eyes while staring at the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was soon discovered. While her attention had been focused on Kaguya, she had completely lost sight of Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka! Looks like she was able to escape!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regret. This is all Kaguya's fault. I will dispel this resentment to beautifully mow down Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Interesting, try it if you can! ‐The decision that didn't come at that time, I'll settle that outcome now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru covered their bodies with wind and kicked off towards the sky at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two storms collided and entangled against each other, scattering around the perimeter while heading for the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………………………Fuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes after the Yamai sisters had left.</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming the safety of the surrounding area, an uneven streetlight blown to the ground emitted a faint glow‐transforming back into Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she was distracted by Kaguya, the wind barrier made by Yuzuru meant she wouldn't be able to run away. And so, Natsumi took advantage of that chance moment to use 'Haniel' to transform into a damaged street light.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I……survived……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi breathed out while full of sweat, sneakily traveling through the woodland path as carefully as possible to avoid being discovered by the other Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those with information controlled the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having no dissent against this opinion, it was only correct to a certain extent‐but, no</p>
<p class="null-p">matter how much information gathered, there are still times where nothing can be done.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……what happened……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While touching a page of the book Angel 'Rasiel' with her finger, Nia let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. She had been using 'Rasiel' to investigate everyone's movements‐but the more she investigated, the more desperate the gap between herself and the other Spirits became evident.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, what a battle between imōto-chan and Oririn. It's almost like a huge monster smack down. Kaguyan and Yuzurun would also be a disaster. Intervening in battle like this would be like diving straight into a blender……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia muttered while her forehead was soaked with sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, 'Rasiel' was an Angel possessing a power well beyond the norm. With the power to know everything in the world, it wasn't an exaggeration to say that it could completely unbalance the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was only a comprehensive evaluation of the Angel's power. If combat ability is evaluated alone, the situation changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Likely, Nia's basic combat ability was close to dead last among the Spirits. Even if she could know everyone's abilities and movements through 'Rasiel', it didn't make her their equal.</p>
<p class="null-p">The future description authority of 'Rasiel' also took a lot of time and effort and it didn't seem that it could exert its full effect on a Spirit that had manifested a complete Astral Dress. As result, the only chance for wining that Nia had was‐ "……What is with those villainous looking eyes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia shoot a quick glance to the side. Maria narrowed her eyes, looking on suspiciously at Nia. Yes. Just now besides Nia, Maria had crossed her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Nia didn't specifically take away the Maria that was onboard 'Fraxinus'. It was merely another copy of Maria materialized through 'Rasiel'. Sharing the same will as the Maria on the warship, it was the equivalent of an extension of the same network.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria is the AI of 'Fraxinus'. But it wasn't an exaggeration to say that half of the reason she</p>
<p class="null-p">was able to materialize a corporal form was due to relying on the authority of Nia's 'Rasiel'. "‐So, even if you help me, won't it not be against the rules……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia winked smugly as she tried to snuggle close to Maria. However, just as her hand was about to reach, Maria took a step back to avoid her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That may be true, but there is one important thing missing from your strategy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My motivation. ‐Why do I have to do something to help you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Maria spat out those words with a moody face, Nia raised her hands in protest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey! It's good to help me a little. Isn't it thanks to me that you finally obtained the real body that you wanted!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would like to ask for a correction. It is thanks to 'Rasiel', not</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't I the same in mind and body as Raiselmon? If you say something like that, I won't lend my reiryoku for your materialization anymore!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Feel free to. We are currently developing an autonomous mobile terminal that applies the technology of the 'Bandersnatch'. It is not as accurate as 'Rasiel', but in the near future it will be possible to reach out to everyone through the Realizer device alone. ‐It would be a sight to behold watching Nia fight alone. Please allow me to pick up your corpse afterwards."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-okay! That was only a stylish Nia-chan joke! Serious Maria-chan is a really good child ☆."</p>
<p class="null-p">With sweat dripping from her cheeks, Nia tapped Maria's nose with her index finger. "……Good grief, there should be limits to being pitiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria, feeling a bit itchy, pursed her eyebrows up and then gave a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. I will lend you a little aid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Nia's eyes lit up as she tried to lean closer to Maria. But, Maria continued on while fending her off with both of her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is a condition. The right to confess to Shidou as the winning prize, I also want to enjoy this right when I win. ‐If I am a part of</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia's abilities, my power should be accepted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, does Maria also want the right to confess to boy as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that not okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no……I am not saying that. But what are you going to say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see. ‐I want to digitize your brain and stay together forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Awful! But the possibility of achieving that is even scarier!" "That's a Maria style joke. Nia is just someone who doesn't understand humor."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria spoke while imitating what Nia had said earlier. It seemed to be retaliation for just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Her eyes didn't show any care for making anyone smile, but there was the feeling of drawing too much attention to that point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Anyhow, Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria cleared her throat while changing the topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our agreement is likely to be useless. Even with my help, the</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirits aren't naïve enough to win from that alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? No, that may be true……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Rasiel' is indeed a very powerful Angel. It may be said to be the strongest for espionage purposes, but its power is far from perfect. We should rely on hit and run tactics through me while always knowing the position of the opponent. Nia herself should never appear on the surface. Please consider the moment you interact with another Spirit to be the equivalent of being done for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, wait, wait, what happened, Maria? It's boorish to say that before it even begins‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Nia frowned, Maria kept her expression unchanged while pointing to behind Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia turned around, following the direction of her fingertip with her eyes‐ "‐Hmm. You seem to have finished discussions, Nia, Maria." After seeing that girl, Nia's body stiffened in terror.</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl with long hair clad in Astral Dress reminiscent of a celestial woman. She held a key-shape cane in her right hand as her left was supporting her waist. Nia looked on in a dumbstruck tone. It appeared that she had been politely waiting for the end of Nia and Maria's conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hoshimiya Mukuro. As soon as that girl's name was recognized, Nia felt sweat covering her entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……Mumumumumu, mukku‐chin……!? Why are you here‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Nia held her breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">While investigation everyone's locations before, Mukuro was still very far away. However, for</p>
<p class="null-p">'Michael' that can open a hole in space, the concept of distance was irrelevant. That power could be called the natural enemy of 'Rasiel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why Nia had to keep tracking her movements with 'Rasiel'. 'Rasiel' was an Angel with the power of omniscience, but it only provided information as long as the user was in contact with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Nia was so prioritized recruiting Maria that her hand had left 'Rasiel' for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few seconds, even though it was just a few seconds, Nia sensed Mukuro's movements too late and allowed her to arrive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let us begin. Prepare your Angel. Maria is a part of Nia's abilities, so assistance is of no issue."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro said as she pointed the tip of 'Michael' towards Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia reached out her hands, pushing forward to stop Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Nia knew best that such a thing wouldn't be effective. It was desperate thinking. Among the Spirits, Mukuro was possibly the worst opponent for Nia. Even if she tried to escape with Maria buying time, it would be futile as long as there was 'Michael'.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why it was out of the question to fight head on. While not being proud of the fact, Nia</p>
<p class="null-p">was weak. ‐What should she do? How to survive from this? What to do‐ "‐I will proceed, Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro lowered her stance to kick off against the ground. While holding her breath, Nia pressed</p>
<p class="null-p">her buttocks against the ground‐raising her voice to shout. "Wwait, Mukku-chin! Shouldn't we……work together!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Nia's desperate proposal, Mukuro curiously tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Deēaryāāah‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Responding to challenge. Teiyah‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two hurricanes ravaged the nature park.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sisters Kaguya and Yuzuru. The twin sisters who together held the Angel of wind</p>
<p class="null-p">'Raphael' crossed blades repeatedly with all of their might. Each time they collided, the wind screamed, the skies wept, the heavens were rended.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two were like a conscious natural disaster. The pair clearly stood as a reason for why Spirits earned that nickname.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fierce battle waged on. The other Spirits were likely already aware of this battle. Nobody has intervened so far, but when the fight was over, there was a chance that someone might come looking for the exhausted winner.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, both Kaguya and Yuzuru didn't reserve any energy for later, choosing to ignore the future as an afterthought. At this moment now, choosing to not exert the maximum amount of effort would mean being struck down by their opponent's reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, the right to confess to Shidou was an attractive reward. Although both Kaguya and Yuzuru both wouldn't hesitate to confess to Shidou, neither of them have had the chance to communicate that feeling specifically.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, right now both of them were focused on a single objective‐being completely immersed in the joy of fighting their other half.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah. When thinking it over, even when counting the fierce over 100 battles fought in the past, it was the first time feeling like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two used to repeatedly compete against each other for sake of determine the true Yamai. However, each one wanted the other to survive rather than be the one who would kill.</p>
<p class="null-p">A distorted matchup where the loser would win. And when the conclusion came, it was inevitable that one of them would disappear. This sad battle had been repeated countlessly by the Yamai Sisters.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐now. "Ooooooooh‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whirlwind. Go."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two could fight at full strength without those worries.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them were extremely excited and grateful for this miracle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka! Are you gasping for air now? Your movements have dulled." "Pointing out. That's my line here. The momentum of your wind is weaker than before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nonsense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya responded with a smile while continuing to feel deeply moved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐To think that such an opportunity would present itself. Do you still remember, what happened on Arubi island?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naturally. How could that be of forgotten. ‐Of course, thanks to</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou it wasn't necessary to settle that final match."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un……I am grateful to Shidou. Thanks to him, Yuzuru and I were able live together without disappearing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. That's true. I am grateful. But‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if responding to what Yuzuru had said, Kaguya strongly nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. A part of me still regrets never having a conclusion to that final battle. ‐But, now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. We can finally settle the score."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them smiled at the same time, the wind scattered from their bodies as they quietly held their Angels.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no need for a signal to begin between these two. Kaguya and Yuzuru kicked off</p>
<p class="null-p">against the sky at exactly the same time, rushing towards each other at a super high speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐at that very moment. "What……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shock. This is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them looked dumbstruck while letting out a confused voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was only natural that the two of them would react this way. At the moment they were</p>
<p class="null-p">about to collide, a 'hole' suddenly appeared in the sky and from inside this hole‐ "‐Maria battalion. Attack."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hundreds of Maria had appeared to attack those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait……!? Maria!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Confused. What is going on? What does this mean‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Kaguya and Yuzuru were lost in confusion while being overwhelmed by the waves of Maria.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"O……oooooooh! Amazing! It's a success, Maria, Mukku-chin!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While touching a page of 'Rasiel', Nia raised her voice in an excited tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sisters were engulfed in a horde of Maria brought from 'Rasiel'. Even against the tyrannically powerful twins, it was possible to take advantage of an opportunity and overwhelm them with sheer numbers.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the result was not something Nia could achieve alone. Turning away from 'Rasiel', Nia turned to face Mukuro in order to firmly hold her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected! With 'Rasiel' added with 'Michael' there is nothing to be scared of anymore!</p>
<p class="null-p">The combination between me and Mukku-chin is the best!" Nia vigorously shook Mukuro's hand while saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Although Nia was unfortunate to encounter Mukuro earlier, she successfully appealed the usefulness of her ability to form a temporary cooperative relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">The effect was just as what was seen. ‐Exploring the whereabouts and movements of the</p>
<p class="null-p">target with 'Rasiel' and then opening a 'hole' through 'Michael' to transfer all of the Marias. It was simple but effective combat strategy.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was simple‐no, because it was simple, Nia couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No……seriously, seriously. I really thought I was a major candidate for losing the first match. I didn't expect I would still have a chance of coming out on top. What should I tell boy? Please make miso soup for me every morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia let out a laugh in a low whisper.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Nia's expression quickly returned to its original state. After all, the one responsible for</p>
<p class="null-p">this outstanding position, Mukuro, had a sullen look marking her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Is something wrong Mukku-chin? Isn't this great win all thanks to Mukku-chin?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……that may be so, but this sensation……doesn't feel like victory. Is this method truly okay…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mukuro lowered her head, Nia quickly took over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, no, a win is a win! Those who are concerned about these matters won't survive until the</p>
<p class="null-p">very end! Mukku-chin, don't you want to be the one to confess to boy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Uh……that's true……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro let out a distressed cry. With sweat dripping down her cheek, Nia took a step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm, Mukku-chin has more of a warrior spirit than I thought……but I can't change course now……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia muttered in a low volume so Mukuro couldn't hear. Besides her, Maria whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if you switch to the direct battle route, the necessity of 'Rasiel' is very weak. The</p>
<p class="null-p">moment this alliance is abolished, the first one to be defeated will likely be Nia. ‐I mean, even if this strategy works well, how do you plan to defeat Mukuro at the very end?" "Uh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being reminded by Maria, Nia felt her speech clog up.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was certainly true. The success in the alliance relied on buying enough time to win. But as long as there could only be one winner, she was destined to fight at the very end. And if it was a direction confrontation, Nia had no chance of victory. Nia made a sullen face while thinking hard about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……After the numbers have been reduced a bit, I'll find another reason to let Mukku-chin fight</p>
<p class="null-p">another strong enemy. When they are both exhausted, I'll attack from behind……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, that's unusually well thought out for Nia. But after the numbers have been reduced to an</p>
<p class="null-p">extent, I hope Mukuro won't say; you guys no longer have any value."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nugu……! Mukku-chin will never say that! The bond of our alliance won't break to something</p>
<p class="null-p">little like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's very unconvincing coming from someone who's already planning on betrayal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐What whispers have just been said now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, she heard a voice coming from someone besides Maria. Nia screamed like a puppy that just had its tail stepped on. From a quick glance, it was obvious that Mukuro was looking on at them suspiciously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, no, n-nothing! Compared to that, we should look for the next target! Alright, the other children fighting now are……ha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia quickly tried to change the topic as she touched 'Rasiel' with her finger again. Next up was to search for Spirits that were already fighting. Compared to a Spirit that was alone, a Spirit focusing on their opponent would be more vulnerable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……Oririn and imoto-chan as well As Yosshi and Mikki. Hmmm. Let's go to Yosshi and</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikki! Maria, prepare all members on standby! Mukku-chin open a 'hole' at my signal!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Nia's orders, Maria sighed while nodding. Although Mukuro looked displeased, she still prepared 'Michael'. She was still willing to abide by Nia's instructions despite looking dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia felt as ease as she concentrated, observing the battle between the Yoshino and Miku and looking for any chance opportunities.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐it was at that moment. "……Mun……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Mukuro and Maria's eyes gave an astonished look. "Hey……? What happened to both of you? What's going‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia stopped observing through 'Rasiel'. Looking at the place where the two of them were</p>
<p class="null-p">watching‐she also gave an equally stunned look. But that was impossible after all. Over there was…… "‐Mukuro, Nia, Maria!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The arrival of Shidou, who should have been on a date with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The playground of the nature park was now surrounded by an icy chill unfit for early springtime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Breathing out white breath, frost covering the ground, the air itself was frigid enough to prick the skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of this was the aftermath of the power of Yoshino's Angel 'Zadkiel'. Each time the huge rabbit-shaped Angel driven by Yoshino manipulated the cold air, the surrounding temperature plummeted.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in the center of this cold air‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiiiiiiii‐yahhoooooooo‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The hot blood boiling in Miku's body melted even the ice and snow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Gabriel'‐'March', 'March', and once more 'March'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku's fingers danced on the sparkling keyboard that appeared around herself, playing a majestic piece. An uplifting song that used the power of the Angel of sound 'Gabriel'. Each time she played it, Miku's body was revitalized with energy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-ehh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch……what the hell! Was such a thing was possible!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino and Yoshinon, who were riding on top of 'Zadkiel', both let out a cry of surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">But such an event had transpired. Miku, who was lacking physical strength among the Spirits, easily evaded the ice pillars and bullets Yoshino had just released.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufuffu‐! You'll be in trouble thinking I would stay the same old me forever! Being an idol</p>
<p class="null-p">involves self-discipline; I didn't become an idol by being lazy!" Miku spoke while giving a wink.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. At that time‐after being saved by Shidou during the battle at DEM Japanese branch</p>
<p class="null-p">headquarters, Miku continued studying ways of fighting as a Spirit alongside her idol activities.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the Spirits were working together, it was only necessary to provide assistance. Many of the Spirits were stronger than Miku. But Miku also judged that it would be more efficient to raise her own combat power while also providing aid.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when Miku was fighting alone, in order to prevent Shidou from never being in danger again‐furthermore, in order save Shidou herself next time, Miku searched for ways where she could fight alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Gabriel'‐'Solo'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku shouted as she slammed her fingers down. At the same time, a silver pipe appeared from glimmering light on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a component that constituted 'Gabriel'. Usually, it would emit a 'sound' that could manipulate others, but‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku pulled out the silver pipe, swinging around and taking a stance of a main character in a Kung Fu movie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh! What is this!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino hurriedly created an ice wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Miku suddenly grinned while spinning the silver pipe at a speed that couldn't be seen. "Hiyaaaaaaaaaah‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The tip of the silver pipe continuously struck the icy wall. Moreover, it wasn't just an ordinary thrust. Each time a blow was struck, the silver pipe played a phantasmal sound‐this sound turned into an invisible shockwave that struck Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">But also these shockwaves weren't only meant to spread chaos. While directing the sounds of destruction, Miku's strength was further polished, adding on a combo that easily crushed Yoshino's ice wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've got to be kidding!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino let out a scream as she retreated backwards. Miku smiled while wiping away the ice on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……well done, Miku-chan. You must really value the right to confess to Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon said in a muffled voice while not daring to lower their guard. Miku naturally replied in agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's for sure. What kind of reaction would that shy Darling make……I can't stop imagining it! I'll be living three meals each day!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku clenched her fist as she shouted. With sweat dripping down her cheek, Yoshino forced a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Yoshino in such a state, Miku suddenly relaxed her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐I don't want to monopolize Darling alone. I love you as much as I do Darling. Even if Darling is getting married, it would be good to go to a country with polygamy so everyone can be a bride. Marrying</p>
<p class="null-p">Darling and everyone together would also be nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Miku-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, so that's why you're so motivated."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino forced a smile again as Yoshinon complained in dissatisfaction. Miku continued to speak while holding the silver pipe in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about? Like I said, I am looking forward to</p>
<p class="null-p">Darling's reaction. Plus, if I don't work hard, I won't be able to help</p>
<p class="null-p">Darling and Tohka-san's date. Besides‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Besides?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino tilted her head in wonder as Miku continued on with glimmering eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐If your reiryoku is exhausted, even your Astral Dress will disappear when you lose……in</p>
<p class="null-p">that manner the loser would be return to being completely exposed just like when the seal is</p>
<p class="null-p">issued by Darling!? That means‐I have to keep winning until the very end!" When listening to Miku's enthusiasm, Yoshino subconsciously took a step back. "Y-yes……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiya……the mystery of Miku-chan's strength has been completely solved."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino lowered their posture to strength their vigilance.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Miku didn't not intend to let the two of them escape. She took the silver pipe from 'Gabriel' and slammed it down to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Gabriel'‐'Rondo'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in the next moment, not only besides Miku's feet‐an innumerable amount of silver pipes surrounded Yoshino and Yoshinon. The silver pipes emitted a sound to bind their movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">'! Yoshino!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino and Yoshinon detected this at the last moment and decided to jump up into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Wow!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nuha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the power output was low, it was difficult to avoid the</p>
<p class="null-p">'sound' that had been released</p>
<p class="null-p">at such a wide range. The ensuing shockwaves attacked Yoshino's body. At the same time, Miku leaped into the air while swinging the silver pipe. "I'm coming‐hey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino furrowed her brow, gathering the cold air into a vortex to condense it into an icy wall. However, the impact of Miku's 'sound' shattered the wall in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku was breaking it apart as the ice was being generated. As such attacks and defenses were repeatedly exchanged, the speed of the ice formation gradually failed to keep up with Miku's speed. "Yoshino! This isn't good! You'll be taken down!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know……! So‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Amidst the splash of ice, such words were exchanged between the two. It was likely a discussion of how to escape from Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That‐won't do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time as smashing the ice wall in, Miku lifted up the silver pipe. At the very tip, the sounds of destruction repeatedly</p>
<p class="null-p">gathered‐ "‐'Symphony'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Swinging down like a hammer, the impact burst all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiyaaaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wagyah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The stunning roar scattered around as Yoshino's Astral Dress faded into particles of light as if eaten away by 'Gabriel's assault.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Miku's victory. The strong sense of accomplishment made her tremble. "! I succeeded! I can fight alone!" However, Miku suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. After her Astral Dress disappeared, Yoshino fell softly onto to the ground in a half- naked state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku-san……please help me eliminate the pain……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino spoke with tears in her eyes as she faintly looked on at Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo……Yooooooshino-san……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Confronted by that captivating figure and voice, all of Miku's rationality disappeared instantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I-it's alright! It won't hurt! But you'll catch a cold like this! I will responsibly take you to a safe place! Come with‐" Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Miku spoke while approaching Yoshino, she finally noticed something resembling a glowing</p>
<p class="null-p">thread stretched out from Yoshino's fingers. "Um…..I'm sorry, Mikusan." "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, Miku was crushed by a huge shadow that approached behind her and lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Remaining Spirits, 9 out of 10</p>
<p class="null-h1">Fragmentary Chapter 4: Reunion</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not long after that she met the suspicious man once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just recently, she felt her other self‐the one who that man was calling "Tohka"‐her heart fell into disorder as my consciousness was dragged out to the surface.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having said that, the emotions flowing from Tohka's heart were a little different from the intense despair from that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Loneliness……forgetting‐forgetting something that should never be forgotten, it was like having an unfathomable sense of uneasiness. It was difficult to endure and even worse trying to search for the source of this pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Waking up, it wasn't the same battlefield as before, but rather a busy city surrounded by many humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">After experiencing countless twist and turns, with that man‐she was reunited with Shidou and talked for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, there was the trouble of being deceived by a woman called Origami and forced to compete with a woman named Mukuro. Despite experiencing these various inconveniences, it wasn't as if there was nothing gained.</p>
<p class="null-p">From his appearance, Shidou was a kind person. At least there was no intention to force Tohka to feel despair. Oddly enough though, perhaps Tohka's despair and sadness came from being connected to this man.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was hurt, Tohka would feel a pain that would hurt her as well. When Shidou struggled, Tohka would also feel her heart grow heavier.</p>
<p class="null-p">……A strange phenomena. She realized that she was muttering to herself as she was about to leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Don't let me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widened as his eyes that were overcome with surprise. She continued to look down at him with a cold look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't let 'Tohka' feel sad."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: The Last One Standing Is</p>
<p class="null-p">A mildly warm breeze past through his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was clear that he need to wear his overcoat just a few days ago, walking around the streets of Tenguu City he could feel the arrival of a new season everywhere. The lawn began to turn green; flower buds were blooming on each tree……and what else but people wearing masks to avoid the pollen dancing in the air. With such things piling up, the scenery of the city gradually faded into the color of springtime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and the others, having left the school, were walking alongside the road while looking at the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p class="null-p">The route was the opposite direction from the road used to commutate to school and the front of the rail station. As they moved away from the school, the huge buildings and lanes became fewer in number. On the contrary, natural scenery likes trees and open fields increased.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Tenka were walking besides both sides of Shidou respectively. Tohka's face lit up every time she saw something rare or unusual, twisting her neck and looking on in keen interest. From time to time, she would ask, "Ooh, Shidou what is that?" As that form of happiness was being conveyed, Tenka kept her lips closed without saying a word.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐while not knowing how long they walked for, Tenka suddenly stopped while raising her</p>
<p class="null-p">brow a little. Then, she raised her face as if looking at somewhere far in the distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐This feeling……hmm, I see. Looks like the intuition of 'Rasiel's host isn't too bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tenka was muttering and whispering something, Shidou was unable to restrain replying in turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">Consequently, Tenka distorted her eyebrows as she glanced over at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter. Don't mind me. You only have to look at</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, I can't do that. Even though it's a date with three people……" "Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou forced a smile with a bead of sweat dripped down his cheeks, Tenka once again huffed from her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Compared to this, isn't there something you wanted to show us?</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't waste Tohka's time."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, she spoke while seeming very dissatisfied. Then Tohka, who was listening to this, shook her head to refute this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not a waste, Tenka. So far, I'm having fun just walking on this road I've never been on before with Shidou and you. ‐It's not a date because something has to happen. The moment of happiness of being with someone, that is a date."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐So it's like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka slightly opened her eyes, likely from never expecting Tohka to say such words. Tohka, unware of the change in expression from Tenka, puffed her chest in confidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I am the sempai when it comes to dates! I will teach Tenka all sorts of knowledge!</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I am the sempai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm. Then show it to me. The essence of a date."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka said that while glancing to the side to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐So it's like this. You've narrowly escaped from death, human."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh, was I on the verge of dying just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not just now. Remember that every move, every word, every deed, are all related to your life. Try and make Tohka just a little bit unhappy and that moment your head will be severed from your neck."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey……"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a dangerous warning pressed in a manner that he couldn't tell whether or not if it was a joke, Shidou almost took a step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this time, Tohka frowned at Tenka, who had just made a frightening speech.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Tenka, don't say that. Besides, a date is what brings</p>
<p class="null-p">'enjoyment' to each other. Don't always make a request to only Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see. Then there's no reason for me to accompany. I don't have any enjoyment to give to Tohka and that human."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about? I told you earlier. We are having 'fun' just being with you. Right, Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka smiled as if seeking for consent. Shidou responded deeply as he nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka turned around to look back. Although it was still a bit cold, this seemed to be her way of agreeing with things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka likely thought so as well. She gave a satisfied look while continuing to nod. "Umu, so you understand. Well then, reconcile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apologize to Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to what Tohka had said, Tenka was unable to contain the frown marking her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">But perhaps unable to go against Tohka's angelic smile, Tenka turned her eyes to Shidou with a look of pure disgust.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I. Am. Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……O-ooh."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had never heard an apology with so much murderous intent. Speaking while shooting a glare that could almost kill, Shidou nodded as he felt his back drenched in sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having said that, Shidou couldn't be overpowered in this mental battle. Shidou cleared his throat to regroup as he turned to speak to those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Well, Tohka, Tenka. Actually, we are about to arrive at the destination soon. Before then, there something I need to ask both of you……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Tohka's eyes were shinning, Tenka looked on at Shidou without saying anything. Shidou extended out both his left and right hands to both of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you close your eyes until we reach the destination? ‐I want to make it a surprise for both of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh! That sounds interesting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Tohka immediately closed her eyes and gripped on Shidou's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other hand, Tenka still gave Shidou a look of disapproval.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm good. Only you and Tohka need to‐" "Tenka."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou and Tohka shouted her name at the same time, Tenka, while still very reluctantly, closed her eyes and gave her hand to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, then let's go slowly. Be careful with your feet."</p>
<p class="null-p">While talking, Shidou pulled their hands and guided them forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">But despite saying that, the pace of those two even with their eyes closed was still a bit faster</p>
<p class="null-p">than Shidou's own speed. He didn't know whether if it was because of their trust in him or if it</p>
<p class="null-p">was due to their other senses being strong enough to walk anywhere even with their eyes closed……likely it was both for Tohka and the latter for Tenka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickened his pace walking backwards in order to not be overtaken by those two before eventually stopping at the corner of the road.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Alright, we've arrived. You two can open your eyes now."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying so, he strengthened his grip a little to give a signal to both of them. Tohka and Tenka, as if consulted with each other prior, stopped and opened their eyelids at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐ "‐Wow‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their freshly opened eyes gradually widened even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this response couldn't be helped either. If this was the first time he saw this scenery, he would have likely made a similar reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. In the gradually expanding horizon, the splendid cherry blossom trees came into view.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was impossible to tell how many petals were blooming on each tree. Such a view was an</p>
<p class="null-p">elegant splendor. Dazzling but also‐ephemeral. An illusory scene that instantly grabbed the sight of the viewer.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the moment, a gust of wind blew. The wind passed through between the trees, swaying the branches up towards the sky and scattering countless petals all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">A Sakura snowstorm that could be seen every so often. Countless petals formed a torrent of light</p>
<p class="null-p">red color; just like a blizzard the scene completely captured Tohka's</p>
<p class="null-p">attention. "W-what is this……flowers‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With cherry petals sprinkling on her hair and shoulders, Tohka's rosy cheeks seemed extremely</p>
<p class="null-p">excited. Shidou smiled while also having some petals land on his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. They're called cherry blossoms. ‐Aah, I've always wanted to show this to Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said that while looking up at the cherry tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. It was here that floated in his mind for a date with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was very simple‐he wanted to show Tohka scenery that she had never seen before. Ever since the encounter with her during April 10th of last year, Shidou and Tohka have seen all sorts of landscapes together. School, cityscape, ocean, autumn leaves, snowy scenery‐each time they saw something new, Tohka's eyes would sparkle.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, by the time he sealed Tohka's reiryoku, all of the cherry blossoms have already all withered, so this was the only scenery he hadn't shown her yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having said that, this may have been a stroke of fortune. Because Tohka had never seen this before, it was the first time he could show this together with Tenka as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐How is it, Tenka? It's beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Mu."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou called out to her, Tenka, who was looking up at the cherry blossoms, shook her shoulders a little and then averted her eyes away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ask Tohka rather than me. If Tohka is happy, then I will‐" While saying that, Tenka's words came to a halt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka had quietly approached her from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Hey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, the cherry blossom petals that she had gathered were thrown on top of Tenka's head just like confetti.</p>
<p class="null-p">Countless petals suddenly soared and fluttered on Tenka's head. In the blink of an eye, Tenka was covered by petals.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahaha, you were wide open!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………You schemed against me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, she had turned into a flower-fairy figure. Tenka half- narrowed her eyes as if deriving some enjoyment from this. Like a dog that was soaked, Tenka shook her body, causing the petals to dance back into the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, at lightning speed, Tenka gathered a handful of petals in the air. As a gift, Tohka also tasted the feeling of a cherry blossom snowstorm in return. In the blink of an eye, Tohka's long hair was adorned with pale red petals.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humph, now we are even‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's words suddenly came to a stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no reason to consider. Shidou, who was also collecting petals as Tohka and Tenka were playing, dropped another petal bath behind Tenka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you should pay attention to your back, Tenka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You bastard."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka intently glared at Shidou, picking up pebbles on the road and chasing after Shidou who tried to escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait……why is it something heavy like stones for retaliation on my turn!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up. Having committed a sin against me, pay with your life in return."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Tohka! Help!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, wait a little Shidou! I'll collect the next round of petals soon!" "Wha……you scum, how cowardly for a human."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, a chase began between the three of them in a street where cherry blossoms danced.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"What‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the lush forest, Mukuro's eyes were stunned as she was at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Turning around after suddenly hearing her name being called‐it was the appearance of Shidou, who should have been on his date with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not only Mukuro, Nia and Maria beside her also had similar shocked expressions. Mukuro lowered 'Michael', which she had prepared as she turned to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nushi-sama……why is thou here? Aren't thou on a tryst with Tohka currently?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mukuro asked, Shidou let out a sigh a relief before replying back. "Aah. The date with Tohka was a complete success. No need to worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"! What, is that really true?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Shidou's answer, Mukuro's eyes widened. Then, Shidou spoke with a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐I have heard everything from Kotori. Everyone worked so hard for mine and Tohka's date. Really‐thank you. It's all thanks to everyone's blessings why I could persist until now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nushi-sama……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it's okay now. There's no need to fight anymore. Come, let's go back to everyone‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Wait a second."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia shouted as if to block out Shidou's voice. While stroking the page of 'Rasiel' with her right finger, she casted a sharp gaze onto Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nia……? What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mukuro asked while confused, Nia leaked out a strange "Nnnnn" laugh while thrusting her finger to point at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ku……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I thought things went too smoothly without a hitch. I'm glad I doubled checked with</p>
<p class="null-p">'Rasiel' just in case. ‐Changing into boy to mount a sneak attack was a rather clever idea. Isn't that right, Nattsun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro couldn't help but look dumbstruck as she turned to look at Shidou again. The face was unmistakably that of Shidou's‐but when thinking of what Nia had said, Mukuro lightly wrinkled her brow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon seeing this, the corners of Nia's lips slowly formed a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a wonderful transformation as usual. Mukku-chin might have been deceived if alone, but with me as the opponent, wasn't this a poor move? I thought Nattsun should have understood this‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While in the middle of speaking, Nia twitched her brow and let out an 'ah' sound as if noticing something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, so you meant to help Yosshi. After all, if that went on, Yosshi and Mikki would have been the next ones targeted. As a good friend,</p>
<p class="null-p">you couldn't overlook that. Well, isn't that really lucky. I've inadvertently caught a big fish. Fuhahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia gave a villainous laugh as she once again pointed her finger at Shidou‐or rather to Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appearing here meant that your luck has run out! Mukuro-sensei if you will!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said all that, but in the end you still end up relying on</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria, who was behind Nia, spoke with open eye closed. However, Nia ignored this (despite sweat dripping from her forehead) as he turned and gave a reliant look towards Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Mukuro did not act immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without there being any signs of rebuttal, there was no doubt that this Shidou was a fake. Of</p>
<p class="null-p">course, there was no anger in Natsumi trying to use Shidou's appearance to deceive Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐ "……Certainly."</p>
<p class="null-p">From the state of mind of Mukuro's perception, Natsumi was speaking in the same voice as</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, in the same appearance as him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess I did something foolish. As long as there is 'Rasiel', no matter how good it is, my identity will still be definitely exposed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, hey."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi widened her eyes as she stared at Mukuro's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't regret my actions. Even if I am defeated here, I am satisfied. ‐What about you Mukuro? Being manipulated by Nia and surviving until the very end, even if you get the right to confess could you stand proudly in front of Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Muku is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told this by Natsumi, Mukuro felt a sharp pain coming from her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if her own worries were speaking right in front of her. Even though she knew it was a fake, she was shocked that this had taken on Shidou's form.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually, apart from this, it was not the case that Mukuro wished to confess to Shidou. Shidou accepted Mukuro and told her to be family. For Mukuro, that was all that she wanted. She had no other cravings beyond that.</p>
<p class="null-p">So why did Mukuro want the right to confess‐it was because she didn't want anyone else to use it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro loves Shidou and that's why she wished for him to stay the same. She didn't want to</p>
<p class="null-p">become a spectator that could only look onward at him. But could right now Mukuro stand in front of Shidou?</p>
<p class="null-p">She had no intention of denying Nia's methods. It was common practice to form an alliance</p>
<p class="null-p">during these battles. The attitude of trying one's best in surviving was also rather beautiful. But‐this didn't match Mukuro's style. It was no more than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait……wait! What are you doing Natssun! When a fake is exposed shouldn't the first instinct</p>
<p class="null-p">be to run away or accept defeat!? Why are you trying to cajole</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukku-chin!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ha, like I said. I already knew it would be exposed. But I also reckon that Mukuro wouldn't agree with Nia's practices. ‐Mukuro!</p>
<p class="null-p">Be more honest with yourself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stooooooop saying that with boy's voice! Don't be fooled Mukkuchin! Let's take over the world together!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Nia, Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Maria tapped Nia's shoulders with her fingertips, Nia glared back in annoyance. "What is it Maria! Can't you see I'm busy right now!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps, but it is an emergency."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I know that! Maria, help me persuade Mukku-chin!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not it. It's another matter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia raised her brow upon hearing what Maria had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hey……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seemingly aware of what this was, Natsumi, who was still transformed as Shidou, made a small smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, sorry Mukuro. Don't be too concerned. Take what I just said with a grain of salt. It</p>
<p class="null-p">was just‐to buy enough time!' "What……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro tilted her head in confusion. As if matching that, Nia also raised her brow in suspicion. Then, Natsumi slowly pointed them to the direction of the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Guided by this, both Mukuro and Nia looked up‐ "Mun‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing those figures that appeared there before long, both of them widened their eyes in alarm.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was no wonder. Because over there was‐ "Ku, ku, ku……how dare you, how dare you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indignation. Prepare……to steel yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wrapped in battered Astral Dresses, both Kaguya and Yuzuru had furious expressions marking their faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya……Kaguyan, Yuzurun……!? Weren't you beaten by the Maria</p>
<p class="null-p">Battalion……why are you here‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia stopped while in the middle of talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she had noticed it just like Mukuro. ‐The upper part of a nearby tree had transformed into a signboard that marked "Nia is here→".</p>
<p class="null-p">There was only one Spirit who could do this. Nia's face turned pale</p>
<p class="null-p">while looking at Natsumi. "Na……Nattsuuuun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……I investigated that Kaguya and Yuzuru haven't dropped out yet. If I do this beforehand, of course they would be coming for revenge."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi said this, a book-like Angel appeared in her hand. ‐An imitation of 'Rasiel' through 'Haniel'. Apparently, she had used this to confirm that the Yamai sisters were still safe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-how devious Nattsun! You don't have the mettle to fight with your own strength!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What nonsense, you don't say!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Retaliation. Will not be merciful. It is a grave offense to hinder our duel, repay with your body." Kaguya and Yuzuru let out a scream of anger as they kicked against the sky to attack Nia. "Kya‐! Help me Maria‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While letting out a sad scream, Nia fled to the gap in-between the trees.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon after, sounds of sorrow and anger were heard coming from the woods and then followed by the sound of trees were being mowed down by the strong wind pressure‐a moment later, it finally quieted it down. It was unclear if Nia had been punished or if she had escaped, but there weren't any signs of the Yamai sisters returning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro let out a small sigh while walking towards Natsumi, who was still transformed as Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's shoulders trembled as she made a posture as if resigning to defeat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, it turned out like this. ……Alright. After all, I was the one who instigated this first. Even if I am defeated, I'll still try my best to use up all of my reiryoku."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi spoke while at the same time giving up. Mukuro stared at Natsumi, spreading out her hands to hug her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……huh? Wait……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the unexpected act, the voice that Natsumi let out was full of confusion. Mukuro gently sighed before whispering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Granted that thou were talking to stall for time, it made Muku wake up. That is a certainly not false. Muku thanks you. Muku wants to obtain a victory that can be proudly felt from the bottom of the heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro spoke as she released Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Even if an imposter, Muku cannot turn her blade at Nushi-sama again. ‐If seen once more, it would be wise to show up in another visage. At that time, Muku will go all out."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro smiled as she kicked against the ground and leaped into the sky. ‐Searching for a battlefield that matched her full strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……, ……, ……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Left alone, Natsumi couldn't even breathe for a while. Her heart was pulsating so violently that it</p>
<p class="null-p">seemed it might break through her ribs. Her fingertips were numb and even her vision was blurry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haaaaaaaah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Until Mukuro's figure couldn't be seen anymore, Natsumi finally let out a huge sigh. At the</p>
<p class="null-p">same time, Natsumi's body released a faint glow, changing back from her Shidou disguise to her original appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Somethings a bit off today. How many times have I narrowly avoided death now……? Seriously, I thought that this time for sure I would have to retire……"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Natsumi closely examined and patted her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ruminating over the aftertaste of being hugged by Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Those boobs are too big."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi muttered as she quickly escaped into bushes in order to not be discovered by the other Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha….., ha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia ran out breath while running through the woodland path where trees grew in abundance.</p>
<p class="null-p">From behind, there were the sounds of the storm Kaguya and Yuzuru summoned and the collision of countless Marias.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Thanks to asking Maria to contain the Yamai sisters, Nia was able to survive. Despite saying that, she was still not safe. Even through a surprise attack, the Yamai sisters</p>
<p class="null-p">couldn't be completely defeated. Even if there was more Marias, it would be difficult to stop them. Once the wall of Marias was broken, Kaguya and Yuzuru would surely catch up to her with their speed being the fastest among the Spirits. Then, everything would wrap up in a single volume.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why Nia was in a hurry. ‐To find a new partner to replace Mukuro. "Who is left now……!? Tell me Rasielmon……!" Nia screamed as 'Rasiel' appeared, keeping her feet focused on escaping as she traced the page without stopping.</p>
<p class="null-p">In terms of espionage, 'Rasiel' was extremely useful. There must be surviving Spirits. If possible, she hoped for the sort of Spirit already fatigued from fighting. Because of that, she would be more likely to seek help. Although there was people who disliked a united front out of personal creed like Mukuro, there was no one who wouldn't want 'Rasiel's power. If she could skillfully negotiate‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Just at that moment. "Uwah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia, who was running while thinking this over, suddenly collided into something, falling onto her backside.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, she thought it was wood or something like that‐but that wasn't it. What Nia felt was softer yet flexible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It hurts; it hurts……what the heck‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Nia suddenly stopped speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had noticed the true identity of what she had struck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ara, ara, Nia-san. Why are you in such a rush?"</p>
<p class="null-p">White skin and black hair unevenly tied on both ends, adorned on her body was a beautiful red and black Astral Dress decorated with a cross.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl standing there, with an unmistakable clock-piece on her eye, smiled gracefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression gentle, her voice soft, but Nia felt the illusion of ice being shoved behind her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Kurumin……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Nia called that name with a trembling voice, that girl‐Tokisaki Kurumi nodded in a playful manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, even though I don't really like fighting. If there is an encounter, we must fight.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is the law of this battlefield."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said sadly in a playful manner. Nia responded with "haha, nice joke" in a low voice. "In any case, let me ask you first. Any last words?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, uh, Kurumin. Let me ask, do you want to team up with me‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐What would that be for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the Spirit, holding the same 'Rasiel' as Nia, revealed a sadistic smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Remaining Spirits, 8 out of 10.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"……There's Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Confirmation. It is Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kaguya and Yuzuru repelled the army of Maria, they looked down at the forest road, looking at a woman lying on the ground and mumbling like a squashed frog.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her toes would occasionally still twitch as her Astral Dress was left in a half-naked state. She seems to have fainted, although she still sometimes groaned as if caught in a nightmare. It was a spectacular defeat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Halfway through, the Marias disappeared. Could it be that……she was beaten by someone outside of us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Conjecture. That is probably the case. Of course, a rebellion from</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria also cannot be denied."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya muttered out "That's also not impossible." in frustration as she stamped on the ground with her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Awful……who was it? That person has stolen our prey. I still want to take revenge."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sigh. It can't be helped. It has nothing to do with anyone who has defeated Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's also true……aah, she's fallen asleep so leisurely."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Caution. An Astral Dress has not manifested, indicating that Nia has been eliminated. I understand the feeling of wanting revenge, but it is against the rules to harm a dropout."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, I know that."</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to what Yuzuru had said, Kaguya exercised a bit of restraint against her fervor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru gazed briefly at Nia's back. Then, they raised their heads at the same time to look at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Now then, there shouldn't be any more inconveniences."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. There's no method of lowering a raised fist in this state."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that case."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru laughed at the same time, kicking off at the ground to gain some distance while holding their respective Angels.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya grasped her huge assault lance 'El Re'em'. Yuzuru steered her pendulum 'El Na'ash'.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two weapons that made up the fastest Angel 'Raphael' both had tiny cracks on the surface from the fierce battle between these two.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, not only that. Both the bound coat Astral Dress and wings on their shoulders were torn to shreds everywhere, revealing faint particles of reiryoku from the cross-section.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both could understand that they were close to their limits without exchanging any words. Needless to say, there was no choice but to continue fighting against each other. Although they</p>
<p class="null-p">didn't know the status of the other Spirits, it was difficult to imagine that there was anyone left in</p>
<p class="null-p">perfect condition. In that case, the possibility of the Yamai sisters winning together was not zero.</p>
<p class="null-p">But both Kaguya and Yuzuru didn't hesitate for a moment to take the former choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, the right to confess to Shidou was very attractive. Even for Kaguya and Yuzuru, they wished to convey the thoughts lingering in their hearts to Shidou. Bashfulness, the fear of anticipating what reply would be received, and concerns about the others. The accumulation of all of this, it was an important feeling that was carefully stored. The opportunity to reveal all of this was truly precious.</p>
<p class="null-p">But above all else.</p>
<p class="null-p">The chance that an existence sharing the same blood and could be called their other half may be</p>
<p class="null-p">defeated by someone else‐the mere possibility couldn't be</p>
<p class="null-p">tolerated. "‐Let's go, Yuzuru."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Accepting challenge. That's just what I want."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two kicked their feet against the ground at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, the surrounding trees creaked. The ground slightly trembled as a shockwave was generated shortly afterwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if there was a witness for this match, they would only be able to feel the movements of those two from the changes in the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that regard‐Kaguya and Yuzuru's speed was so fast that it was almost impossible to completely see that their reiryoku was about to reach its limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the pair correctly grasped each other's movements. Numerous collisions were felt as each compressed their consciousness to the limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya pulled out 'El Re'em' and rotated it like a drill. Then, Yuzuru spun around 'El Na'ash' to generate a whirlpool. As the two forces collided against each other, both Angels were blown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Tch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the two of them didn't stop. Kaguya and Yuzuru infused reiryoku into their clenched fist, slamming it against each other with great force.</p>
<p class="null-p">With their arms crossed against each other, both landed a direct hit on the other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ka, ah……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"An…..guish……"</p>
<p class="null-p">A terrifying shockwave burst at where the two landed their punches. In a single breath, their already ruined Astral Dresses were blown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Left in a semi-naked state, both Kaguya and Yuzuru swayed and fell on their backs. Lying side by side like two huge characters, both of their heads were next to each other. "Haah……haah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fu‐ha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a while, the chests of those two violently contracted and expanded as the sounds of heavy breathing dominated the area. Then, when the two finally calmed down‐Kaguya laughed loudly towards the sky. "Hahahahaha……ah~ah……of course it turned out</p>
<p class="null-p">like this. Although I seriously thought for a moment that I could win……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if to match her, Yuzuru also laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh? You as well? Having said that, now it's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Estimate. With the exception of after the sealing, it is now 100 matches, 25 wins, 25 loses‐and 50 draws."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yuzuru said that, Kaguya laughed once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Next time‐I will definitely win."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impudent. I'll return those words wholly intact right back at you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru looked towards each other, swaying their arms up to bump fists with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Remaining Spirits, 6 out of 10.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After talking for a while in-between the rows of cherry blossoms, they went towards a dessert shop nearby the road.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although there were numerous factors in playing too much that caused them to take a break, the main reason was because while playing, Tohka's stomach……began to grumble. Since none of them formally had a full-fledged lunch, they walked to nearby store to fill their bellies first.</p>
<p class="null-p">The décor of the shop was quite stylish. In front of the store, there was a vermillion carpet covering long benches and an open-air umbrella. Coupled with the falling cherry blossoms, it created a very scenic landscape. While being integrated as part of this scenery, they were waiting for their meal to be delivered here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, a cherry blossom carried by the wind fell softly onto Shidou's glass of green tea, drawing small ripples on the surface of the hot water.</p>
<p class="null-p">While watching this occur, Tohka, who was sitting beside him, rounded her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, the cherry blossoms danced onto Shidou's teacup! Muu, how beautiful……why don't you come to my tea cup as well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, I guess you have to ask the cherry blossoms in that regard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Shidou was speaking, Tenka gently huffed from her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, a breeze rolled up as two cherry blossoms floated onto Tohka's teacup. "Ooh! It came to me! And there are two of them!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tenka, what did you do just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked while sweating, Tenka averted her eyes as if to play dumb. ……Her expression</p>
<p class="null-p">seemed too unnatural. Here was her world; it wasn't difficult to achieve something like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, even so it was a waste of effort to even pursue this question. As long as Tohka was happy, it was good for the time being. Judging it to be like this, Shidou forced a smile without pushing the issue further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐I've kept you waiting‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, a clerk dressed in Japanese clothes came arrived with a tray filled with dishes. Tohka's face brightened in response to that voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, you've arrived! I've been waiting so long!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The store likely didn't expect such a huge welcome. The other party smiled happily while placing the dishes on the long table.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the round candy on the plate, Tohka's eyes also widened like an open circle to match the sweet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh!? What is this Shidou‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's sakuramochi. The faint shade of pink is really beautiful. There's also red bean paste inside."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hoho, cherry blossoms……imitating the color of that flower. I see, it's beautiful. So what is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Tohka pointed to another dish that was near Tenka. The shape was slightly different from the Japanese sweets placed under Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ones by Tohka were round shape while the ones near Tenka were more resembling flat dough wrapped in a cylindrical shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, the ones by Tenka are also sakuramochi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? But the shape seems quite different."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doumyōji and Chōmeiji‐in short it's between Kansai and Kyoto styles. Since it's rare to get both of them side by side like this, how about a taste comparison?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, that sounds good. Let's eat them right away!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka spoke in a cheerful voice, Tenka took the plate holding cherry blossoms to the side while staring at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Tenka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't there a leaf stuck on this confectionary? You bastard, you want Tohka to eat something like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She spoke while pointing to the leaf on the surface of the cherry leaf cake. Understanding where this worry was coming from, Shidou couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure it must seem strange at first. Its cherry blossom leaves pickled in salt. Rest assured its edible‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is that true?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, it's true‐mugu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Shidou stopped speaking. No‐to be more precise, he had been forcibly stopped. "In that case, let's have you taste it first then."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Tenka thrusted the cherry leaf cake into Shidou's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! ……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was startled by the sudden occurrence, but as Tenka's eyes look on in suspicion, he was able to somehow calm down his breathing and swallow the cherry leaf cake thrown into his mouth. Whether fortunately or unfortunately, the cherry leaf cake itself tasted delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the side, Tohka pouted in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu, it's too unfair if only Tenka gets to feed Shidou. ‐Shidou, I also want to feed you as well!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While speaking, Tohka stabbed a cherry leaf cake with a toothpick and offered it to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving another one just after somehow swallowing Tenka's sakuramochi‐ "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why aren't you eating Tohka's cherry leaf cake? Do you want to die? With such words were being conveyed through Tenka's glare, he couldn't refuse at all. Without any better options, he reluctantly took in a second cake into his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, how is it Shidou, is it delicious!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……, ……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not being able to open his mouth anytime soon, all he could do was smile to show affirmation. Then, Tohka responded with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, so it was good! Then Tenka, let's have some as well!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed halfway against her will even after using Shidou for poison testing. But Tohka eventually agreed and stabbed the cherry leaf cake with the toothpick.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, at that moment she stopped her hand as she watched Tohka press her hands together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itadakimasu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka put the already picked up sakuramochi back on the plate and mimicked Tohka by placing her hands together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itadakimasu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, after speaking in the same manner as Tohka, she looked closely at the sweet before tossing it into her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other side, having already hastily eaten one, Tohka's eyes began to widen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Ooh, this is delicious……! There's a little salty taste in the sweetness and it smells nice and</p>
<p class="null-p">pleasant……it's my first time eating something like this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, I'm glad you liked it. ‐How about you, Tenka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Not bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Tenka replied while looking away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although her eyes remained sharp and her tone stayed blunt, it was difficult to fully cover up the satisfaction in her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">One beat later, he slowly began to understand. Tenka's responses were marked with the same distrust of humans that Tohka had when they first met.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Shidou was also aware that‐although Tenka's behavior was a bit rude; she wasn't the type of Spirit who would rewrite the world for personal gain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...What is it human? Is there any complaints?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, he had been staring at Tenka for a bit without saying a word. As if to gloss it over,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickly looked away. Seemingly in line with this, a cherry leaf cake inserted onto a toothpick was handed over from Shidou's right side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tenka! This sakuramochi is also delicious. Come and try it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes lowered to the sakuramochi that was being presented. In turn she also stabbed another mochi with the toothpick and offered it to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inevitably, the shape of two hands crossed together appeared in front of Shidou's eyes. "Ooh, thank you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's entire face brightened as she drew her mouth closer to the confectionary that was being offered. Then, in a similar fashion, Tenka also bit into the mochi offered by Tohka offered as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just in front of his face, two identical people were happily chewing on dessert. From this strange scene, Shidou couldn't help but strain a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu……! This one is delicious as well! The different texture from the previous one also tastes great!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka smiled while nodding, Tenka pursed her eyebrows up while having a somewhat difficult look on her face. Although both expressions where different, it was easy to tell that both were satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐ "……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, the sound of something exploding was heard in the distance. Shidou's body</p>
<p class="null-p">trembled as he turned to that direction. "W-what was that sound just now……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Don't mind it."</p>
<p class="null-p">In contrast to Shidou who was astonished, Tohka spoke in a nonchalant manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those participating in being nosy are a bit in too high spirits. Just keep continuing this date with</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Tenka, just now was‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked at Tenka while being confused. Certainly, as she was now, it wasn't strange to</p>
<p class="null-p">know everything occurring in this world. However, the ones who were nosy were…… Then, as Shidou was thinking that over, his hand was suddenly tightly held by Tohka. "Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked on Tohka in astonishment. But Tohka didn't seem bothered by the explosion just now as she gently smiled at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Shidou, can you leave what's next to me? There are many places in the city that I want to show Tenka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-of course you can, but……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This way! Let's go. Come, Shidou, grab Tenka's hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Tohka stood up from the bench. Shidou looked on at Tenka, widening his</p>
<p class="null-p">eyes as if saying 'eh?'. But Tenka pouted while glaring back. "Like I said, it doesn't matter. You two should‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Don't say it doesn't matter. ……This opportunity will never happen again."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to interrupt Tenka, Tohka gave a sad smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Shidou felt as if his heart had been tightly squeezed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then next moment, Shidou left hand was grabbed. Whatever caused the direction of the winds to change, Tenka, who was showing a look of disapproval beforehand, had taken the initiative to grab his hand herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Humph. If you want to go, hurry up human. The date time is limited."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-aah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was pulled up by both Tohka and Tenka. Mysteriously, it was a completely reversal of when he previously took the lead to take them to the rows of cherry blossoms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noticing this, Tohka's eyes brighten even more. "Okay, let's set off.</p>
<p class="null-p">So first is here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While speaking, Tohka moved forward at a brisk pace. Tenka also moved her feet to keep up with Tohka. His right hand was gently pulled while his left hand was a bit roughly towed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was being led by these two through the rows of cherry blossoms, his mind wandered back to what Tohka had said earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">This opportunity will never happen again.</p>
<p class="null-p">This probably meant that Tohka and Tenka would never have the opportunity to be present again at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But why‐</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, those words he heard seemed to have another meaning.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay, Miku-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well‐don't worry about it. She seems to have just lost consciousness."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino asked in concern, her reply was answered vaguely by Yoshinon, who remained lodged inside 'Zadkiel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino was riding on 'Zadkiel', slowly moving through the park with an unconscious Miku behind her. The Astral Dress thought to be broken was once again on her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Yoshino's reiryoku had not been completely exhausted. She had let Miku assume that by temporarily releasing her Angel and Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Yoshino was distracting Miku's attention, she remotely controlled a reemerged 'Zadkiel' to attack her from behind. ……Honestly, that may not have been a praiseworthy method, but the current Miku was not to be underestimated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino, who had a difficult but successful victory, was in the process of moving the now half- naked Miku to a safe spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un……unn……it's no good Yoshino-san. Nothing will come out even if you suck that</p>
<p class="null-p">much……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while listening to those words being muttered in her sleep, a hand suddenly extended out</p>
<p class="null-p">from behind to grope Yoshino's body, causing her shoulders to involuntarily tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, these vibrations were transmitted to the threads steering 'Zadkiel'. Miku's body subsequently fell off from 'Zadkiel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-sorry……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino, descended down from 'Zadkiel' in a flustered state, carrying Miku, who had her face planted on the ground, onto 'Zadkiel's back once more. ……In fact, this had been the third time this exchange has happened. Each time they walked just a few steps, Miku would sleep-talk and not let go of Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm‐has Miku-chan really fainted? Isn't it forbidden to touch us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu……fu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as Yoshinon asked, Miku merely continued to sleep peacefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Generally speaking, it was perhaps doubtful whether or not Miku was truly sleeping. But Yoshino, who had seen Miku's awful sleeping posture with her own eyes at the 'Fraxinus's lounge room, could only force a smile at the sight. They had to find</p>
<p class="null-p">a suitable place before her sleeping posture worsens.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After going on for a while, Yoshino discovered a place similar to a resting area. There were wooden benches and tables covered by a simple roof.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ratatoskr' would protect those who had been eliminated, so it should be no problem to leave her here for now. After considering that over, Yoshino dropped Miku off from 'Zadkiel' and placed her on the bench.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……? Sff, sff……"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Miku's nose kept sniffing as her body rolled down from the bench as she squirmed on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku-san……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Truly a ridiculous sleeping posture……I say where is she going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino and Yoshinon looked on in surprise, Miku's legs came to a halt‐leaping towards a streetlight near the rest area. And without changing posture, she gave a passionate kiss to the streetlight!</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Miku-san, what are you doing……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino hurriedly moved to pull Miku away from the streetlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at the very next second. "Gyaah‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a high-pitched scream, the streetlight Miku was holding onto gave off a glow, transforming into a young girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-natsumi-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Recognizing the appearance of that girl, Yoshino couldn't help but instinctively round her eyes open and call out that girl's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi cursed her own carelessness.</p>
<p class="null-p">……No, originally, Natsumi would have cursed Miku's monster sense of smell when asleep. But out of fear of a rebound curse, she instead chose to curse herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">After succeeding in eliminating the cooperative relationship between Mukuro and Nia, Natsumi's next course of action was to make a copy of 'Rasiel' through 'Haniel' in order to search for the movements of the other Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's first concern was the holders of 'Rasiel', Nia and Kurumi. Natsumi's Angel 'Haniel' showed its true worth through using subterfuge and disguises to exploit the weakness of her opponents. However, because of the spoilers from the omniscient Angel 'Rasiel', her Angel would have no effect.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia could expose Natsumi's true identity in an instant. For Natsumi,</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia's powers could be described as her natural enemy. As long as 'Rasiel' remained on the battlefield, even if she had transformed to hide herself, she couldn't be caught off guard at any time.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the reason why Natsumi wanted to eliminate the alliance between Mukuro and Nia. Because the two of them were going to intervene on Yoshino and Miku's battle‐that part was also true. However, it was simply too dangerous for Natsumi to ignore a twoman team that could understand the entire battlefield through Nia and dispatch troops anywhere through Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">(……Ah, Nia was defeated by Kurumi. But Kurumi is almost completely uninjured……how troublesome……)</p>
<p class="null-p">As she was confirming the situation in the rest area of the park‐from there she could hear the sound resembling the rustling of grass being pushed aside.</p>
<p class="null-p">(……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking there, she could see the tip of a huge rabbit ear over the bushes. ‐No doubt about it. It was Yoshino's 'Zadkiel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other side seemed to have not noticed her yet, but it seemed she was approaching the rest area.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ku……)</p>
<p class="null-p">If a bad move was made, she may be noticed. After thinking it over,</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi decided to activate</p>
<p class="null-p">'Haniel' to transform herself into a streetlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't want to make any sudden surprise attacks. Moreover, Natsumi wanted to avoid</p>
<p class="null-p">fighting Yoshino. As long as Yoshino lacked 'Rasiel', this should be possible‐</p>
<p class="null-p">……And so, such details had transpired towards the present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, really!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi frowned as she tried to push Miku's cheeks away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Miku was clinging on with great strength, it couldn't match Natsumi now that she had a complete Astral Dress equipped, causing her to tumble down a roll backwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaan……Natsumi-san is so unkind……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku muttered out loud while sleep-talking. She was definitely asleep, yet her personality quirks</p>
<p class="null-p">still affected everyone else. Natsumi's body trembled as she turned to face Yoshino. "……Yoshino." Natsumi called out her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">……But Natsumi delayed her next words, because it was clear what would be said afterward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Originally, this was a battlefield, a place where Spirits would fight against each other. After an encounter, no words were necessary for the usual outcome of the battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if possible, she didn't want to encounter Yoshino. She really didn't want to face a</p>
<p class="null-p">gentle and sacred Goddess like Yoshino. If Yoshino wanted to the right to confess to Shidou,</p>
<p class="null-p">there was a small feeling in Natsumi's heart of not wanting to disturb that even if it was only a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">In Natsumi's mind, it was not as if she didn't have the desire to convey her feelings to Shidou. However, it must have been trifle when compared to the feelings that Yoshino had. Besides, even Shidou would be happier with a confession for Yoshino or the other Spirits than from Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Even if eliminated here, it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't be bad thing for Yoshino, she must understand that. After deciding that, Natsumi began to consume reiryoku in order to make this as painless as possible‐</p>
<p class="null-p">But. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she was about to speak, Natsumi couldn't help but hold her breath as those thoughts lingered in her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Yoshino kicked off the ground to land back on 'Zadkiel' on the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You haven't been eliminated yet, Natsumi-san. ‐I'm so happy." Then, while smiling, she began to assume a fighting stance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, wait……Yoshino‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The unexpected militant response caused Natsumi to wince.</p>
<p class="null-p">No way, to consider that the gentle Yoshino would say such a thing. Was it the atmosphere of the battlefield that caused people to change? Or was it the desire for the right to confess to Shidou‐ "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking of this, Natsumi bit into her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe there was no reason. But it could be seen from Yoshino's expression‐fighting against</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi would make her happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">For an instant‐Natsumi remembered the words that she had just said.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I don't regret my actions. Even if I am defeated here, I am satisfied. ‐What about you Mukuro? Being manipulated by Nia and surviving until the very end, even if you get the right to confess could you stand proudly in front of Shidou?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words were just nonsense she said to stall for time until the Yamai sisters arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, her remarks seemed to have attracted Mukuro's attention. Listening to herself say that……it felt as if she was already proud of grasping victory from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then what about Natsumi? Was she really going to contradict her own words‐? "……Aah, really, shit, shit. ……This isn't like me at all……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi spat those words out unsatisfactorily, a broom-like Angel manifested‐twirling in the air before she pointed it at Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Spirit ・Natsumi. Angel‐'Haniel'. ‐Let us begin the match." Then, she declared so while holding down the cap of her Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino smiled happily while letting 'Zadkiel' move forward as a response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spirit ・Yoshino. Angel‐'Zadkiel'. ‐Challenge accepted."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Who was the strongest among the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">When asked such a question, who would be the name that everyone would choose.</p>
<p class="null-p">Judgement criteria may vary when describing the strongest. Those who are skilled at manipulating reiryoku. Those with a powerful Angel. Those who are skillful at</p>
<p class="null-p">strategizing‐surely each person was a king in their respective fields, and the outcome of this battle would be determined by these various complex factors. Who was the 'strongest' was not something so easily defined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when only a one on one battle is assumed, among those competed for the summit, she couldn't count the number of times Tobiichi Origami would qualify. Looking at the light gathering towards a single location from every direction, such a thought passed through Kotori's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Possessing a huge amount of reiryoku, the Angel of light destroyed everything. Moreover‐she had the most practical combat experience among the Spirits, possessing the talent of a Wizard along with the enormous power of being a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having said that‐ "'Camael'……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori wasn't an opponent that would shut up silently. Kotori screamed the name of her Angel, manipulating the edge of her flaming war-axe to shoot down countless parts of 'Metatron' dispersed in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Fu‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Each time, Origami would summon a new 'Metatron' to continuously emit rays of light. However, even for someone as strong as Origami, her reiryoku was not inexhaustible. Then moment she runs out of reiryoku and 'Metatron' disappears‐that would be the chance for Kotori to strike.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that would only work if Kotori's reiryoku doesn't exhaust itself first. The rays of</p>
<p class="null-p">'Metatron' pierced through her Astral Dress, Angel, and limbs several times. Although</p>
<p class="null-p">'Camael' revived her body each time with its healing flame, her regenerative ability wouldn't be able to exert itself either if her reiryoku was exhausted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyhow, both of them put all of their effort into this fight. An intense fist fight to see which side would run out of stamina first.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Halfway through the fight, Kotori clicked her tongue in frustration.</p>
<p class="null-p">The battle situation was almost equal‐despite wanting to say that, in actuality Origami was beginning to prevail.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was likely because of their different human combat abilities.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Camael' and 'Metatron' are both powerful Angels. Although their specialties and authorities differ, it can be said that their power output was comparable to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, compared to Kotori who has seen far more desk work unsuited for her physical age on a regular basis, Origami had trained regularly and experienced numerous battles. The difference in their current limits appeared there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just a bit more‐I've also trained diligently."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori frowned as she swung 'Camael', the blade of flames swept through the air, incinerating</p>
<p class="null-p">one by one the 'feathers' of 'Metatron' that released beams of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, a single feather that escaped the attack released a beam of light that slammed against</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's abdomen. "Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's face distorted in agony as she moved to strike down that 'feather'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling a scorching sensation, her wounded belly and Astral Dress began to regenerate as she glared at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">The mightiest opponent, the Spirit of light that could mow down thousands.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kotori couldn't afford to retreat. Because‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Leave it to your little sister, no matter how you plan to confess to Onii-chan‐I absolutely won't allow it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori screamed, kicking against the sky towards Origami while swinging 'Camael' with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, countless parts of 'Metatron' pointed their tips at Kotori, launching a fierce attack without any reservation. If they continued this war of attrition, Kotori would be the first to run out of reiryoku. Then, currently while she still has enough reiryoku for regeneration, it was necessary to land a decisive blow on Origami‐ ‐But, at that moment. "Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">An unexpected feeling at her chest, Kotori couldn't help but raise her voice in a panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, she thought that she had been attacked by 'Metatron' at a blind spot‐but that wasn't it. Looking at it, she saw a 'hole' opened in the void, as a key-shaped object appeared from there to stab her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no pain. But the moment her brain recognized this fact, Kotori cursed her own carelessness.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Mukuro's 'Michael'. Because she was distracted by Origami, she didn't notice it until she was attacked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">If the key turned and her power was 'sealed', then defeat would be decided in an instant. Kotori desperately twisted her body to escape from 'Michael'. But it seemed it was too late‐!</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Shifuru'."</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice heard from the other side of the 'hole' was bit different than what she had expected. "Huh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, Kotori felt the power in her body swell up. She could see 'Metatron's movements far better than before. Kotori twisted her body, dodging all of the beams of light and retreating to behind Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">No doubt about it. This was not 'Segva' but that rather</p>
<p class="null-p">'Shifuru' which released the hidden</p>
<p class="null-p">power of the target. Kotori was once granted this power during the battle against Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori was staring at her own palm, she heard Origami let out a sigh from up front.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking on, she could see that the tip of 'Michael' had struck Origami's body just as it did to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, just as it had occurred with Kotori‐the instant the key turned; the reiryoku emitted from Origami's body increased. "……Mukuro."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami raised her brow in suspicion as she asked to the empty sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if in response to that voice, a bigger 'hole' than before opened as Mukuro appeared from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Astral Dress covering her body was a bit different than normal. She looked like a fierce military leader that had liberated her own power as well through 'Shifuru'. In her hands,</p>
<p class="null-p">'Michael' had also changed shape from a khakkhara to a halberd.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. Please excuse the obstruction. Firstly, apologizes for the impolite unforeseen attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Muku told usage of 'Shifuru' prior, Muku doesn't believe she would be trusted with confidence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you intending to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Origami's question, Mukuro gave an exaggerated nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐As it is known, there is no satisfaction in defeating an opponent that is already weary. With</p>
<p class="null-p">this, everyone can fight at their best. Come, it matters not if both attack together." While saying that, Mukuro smiled fearlessly as she prepared 'Michael'. "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who judged the battle situation in an instant, prepared to open fire from 'Metatron' at both Kotori and Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori let out a long breath, then raised her voice‐while 'Camael's flames were burning all over her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Fine. I'll teach both of you the power of a little sister."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Haniel'‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a scream, Natsumi raised 'Haniel' and used 'Kaleidoscope' to change its shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Haniel' gave off a glow as its silhouette changed into a huge battle axe. ‐'Camael'. Holding Kotori's Angel of fire, she swept the flames to attack Yoshino who was riding 'Zadkiel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino manipulated 'Zadkiel' to create an ice wall. 'Camael's edge cleaved the barrier right in the middle, but despite melting the attack didn't reach Yoshino. Earlier Yuzuru had avoided all of Natsumi's attacks through her swiftness, but Yoshino was able to stop the entire blow with her heavy ice wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be different matter, if the original master Kotori was using the real 'Camael', but Natsumi could only achieve this much.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how convenient, a sham would remain a sham. ‐Truly an Angel worthy for</p>
<p class="null-p">someone like herself. Natsumi gave a self-depreciating laugh in the middle of the battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But……even a counterfeit has its own way of fighting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi shouted as she lifted the huge axe in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, 'Haniel' shined once more‐this time transforming into a huge rabbit puppet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. She had copied the exact same 'Zadkiel' that Yoshino was riding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya! Yoshinon's long lost twin!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surprised by this sight, Yoshino and Yoshino both let out an astonished voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Burst forward, 'Zadkiel'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi controlled the pseudo 'Zadkiel' to release a barrage of enormous ice bullets.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">To prevent this, Yoshino generated a new ice wall. But her earlier surprise delayed her timing. Huge chucks of ice collided against each other, scattering around as sparkling grains of ice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was for an instant. But during that instant, the ice walls protecting Yoshino had shattered. It was a slight gap, but the chance for victory opened up for Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Raphael'‐'El Kanaph'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a cry, 'Haniel' changed shape once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">A huge bow shaped like a pair of wings, an arrow that could pierce through anything, and chains that served as string to hold everything together.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sister's 'Raphael', the shape that appeared when both sisters combined their Angels. "Ooooooooooh‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi screamed as she pulled the bowstring with all of her strength. After aiming for the head of 'Zadkiel', Natsumi fired the arrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the tip of the arrow, a tremendous wind pressure blew away the surrounding trees, the nearby resting area, and Miku who was still unconscious.</p>
<p class="null-p">The spiraling whirlpool of reiryoku generating this wind mowed down everything in its path as it went towards 'Zadkiel' and Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be impossible to stop this with an ice wall now.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐ "………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Narrowing her eyes at the spiraling gale, Natsumi could't help but hold her breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. The moment she thought 'Raphael' had reached its target, the figure of 'Zadkiel' disappeared suddenly. "Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">In less than the blink of an eye, Natsumi quickly understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Zadkiel' had not disappeared‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, it had compressed itself to the limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Zadkiel'‐'Siryon'……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino dressed in silver armor, and sacrificing a portion of that armor to receive the blow from</p>
<p class="null-p">'Raphael', quickly approached Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a flurry, Natsumi tried to activate 'Haniel', but‐ "‐Aaaaah!" Her Astral Dress was completely torn apart by the blizzard vortex that Yoshino had brought out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Remaining Spirits, 5 out of 10.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ha…..., ha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino gasped for air, her shoulders shaking as her knees hit the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Covering her entire body in the silver armor‐'Siryon', the parts on the left side of her head and shoulder had been split open. Originally, she wanted to rebuild the armor for repair, but because Yoshino's reiryoku was reaching its limit, even that was too difficult to manage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly‐it really was a last ditch effort for victory. "Kya!</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon's ear!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-sorry, Yoshinon……I'll fix it later……"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Siryon' was a form of defense and offense that condense</p>
<p class="null-p">'Zadkiel' so that it could be worn over the body. In other words, Yoshinon's consciousness now dwelled in this armor. Although the rabbit puppet main body was safe in Yoshino's pocket, Yoshinon must have felt half of its head and shoulder missing in this current state. Yoshino spoke while gently stroking part of the left rabbit ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as she remembered, Yoshino lifted her head and approached Natsumi, who had collapsed on her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-are you alright, Natsumi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, aah……yeah, if you eliminate my entire body feeling sore and being cold enough to freeze to death, then I'm fine……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking weakly, Natsumi let out an "achooo!" sneeze "Are you really alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshinon played the role of the calm straight man, Natsumi waved her hand with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm really fine. Maybe it's because I was able to use my reiryoku to the limit. Or perhaps because I was able to fight against</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino with all of my energy‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi laughed before continuing on. "I don't know why……but I feel great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino gave a gentle smile as she held Natsumi's trembling hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ah, ah, what a beautiful scene. The two sides that fought hard are praising each other's struggles. Watching this truly feels like washing away at my heart."</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, Yoshino's body trembled as she heard such a voice coming from behind her. "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi……san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino called out that name as a young girl appeared from the shadow on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokisaki Kurumi. The instigator of this battle and the one called the worst Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her arrival, Natsumi lightly clicked her tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What a timely manner to show up. You aimed for our match to finish in order to reel in the profit of beating the exhausted winner like a fisherman.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really…..how vile."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara. I'm sad that I'm being misunderstood like that." While saying that enthusiastically, she rubbed her eyes as if wiping away tears. ‐Well, rather than tears, her face was dyed with a delighted smile not resembling crying in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever the reason or process, the important thing is right now. Miku-san and Natsumi-san have used up all of their reiryoku and dropped out. Then the ones standing here are only Yoshino-san and myself. ‐So isn't there only one thing to do? In fact, I also have a lot of feelings I wish to convey to Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi spoke while distorting the corners of her lips into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Covering her entire body with</p>
<p class="null-p">'Siryon', a creaking sound was heard as Yoshino stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yoshino."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Only option is to press on. ‐Kurumi-chan, it's too bad, but the right to confess to</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou-kun will be taken by Yoshino!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon spoke with a voice without any hint of compromise. Normally, Yoshino would feel bashful hearing those words. ‐But only this time, Yoshino gave a vigorous nod to show her agreement to that declaration.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yoshino had very little reiryoku left. 'Siryon' was also in a half-broken state. In contrast, Kurumi remained unscathed. The gap between the two was obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I won't lose. It is me who will convey my feelings to Shidousan."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why she couldn't retreat here. If she did, she wouldn't' be able to face Miku or Natsumi who tried their best. After breathing a slight sigh, Yoshino propelled her body forward as if like a bullet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the spirit. ‐Now, now, are we starting so soon? Please try your best. Your opponent is</p>
<p class="null-p">just the weak me. Though depending on Yoshino-san's efforts, maybe you can win?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said with a beckoning gesture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aaaaaaaah‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino, who covered her entire body with cold air, rushed towards Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Remaining Spirits, 4 out of 10.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">In the sky, a huge melee was on display.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, Kotori, Mukuro. Three Spirits, each with enormous strength, launched a three-way brawl at full power. Light danced in the sky, flames blew away in the air, and 'holes' opened up in space. Each respective Angel had the power to decide the outcome in a single blow and now that power was flying about chaotically everywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a tense situation where even letting her mind falter for a second could mean a fatal injury, Origami calmly analyzed the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps due to her latent ability being liberated through Mukuro's</p>
<p class="null-p">'Shifuru', but Origami felt her thought process become clearer than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">The war situation‐could roughly be considered in a stalemate. Although Origami held a more dominant position through</p>
<p class="null-p">'Metatron's sheer numbers, Kotori still held the advantage in close combat. And more importantly, she had the ability to regenerate through her flames, which meant that an incomplete attack wouldn't be able to harm her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, it would be mistake to launch an all-out attack from</p>
<p class="null-p">'Metatron' until Kotori's reiryoku is exhausted.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, on this battlefield was now Mukuro with her key Angel 'Michael'. She could open a 'hole' in space that connected any two points in which she desired. That is to say, she could redirect an opponent's attack right back to them. If Origami randomly scattered her light, she was liable of being taken down by her own Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if she continued like this, the stalemate would remain endless. Upon deciding that, Origami took a deep breath to concentrate her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Metatron'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as Origami called out that name‐in addition to those already flying in the sky, new 'feathers' emerged.</p>
<p class="null-p">The total number reached 100. It was a desperate battle strategy that meant exhausting the remaining reiryoku in her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Mun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was determined to decide the outcome of this match. Both Kotori and Mukuro looked on with nervous expressions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami raised her hand to the sky, calling out to give commands to the countless 'feathers'. "Crush everything, 'Kadour'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Under Origami's orders, 100 'feathers' flew in the sky while drawing orbits with light.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Metatron', with many more numbers than usual, shot light rays from every direction towards Kotori and Mukuro. Kotori turned around to avoid it, or used «Camael» to knock off the rays, flying in the sky to escape the siege.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro's actions were similar, but in addition, she used 'Michael' to open the 'holes' in space, shooting the rays of 'Metatron' back towards Origami. The beam of light fired from the 'holes' opened in the air, piercing through her Astral Dress, or grazing Origami's legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami did not dodge. Turning herself into light to evade the attack only meant spending more reiryoku‐furthermore, Mukuro's counterattack was within the scope of her plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if the attack is returned, she can still put in her strength to endure a few more shots.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Origami's true purpose was not this mass attack. 'Kadour's attack, until the end was only aimed at drawing the attention of Kotori and Mukuro, creating the opportunity for a trap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Kotori swung down 'Camael' and Mukuro pulled 'Michael' out of the air: a moment when both of them just finished using the Angels. Origami's sharp will identified that moment as the rays emitted from the 'feathers' knit into a net, blocking the exit for both of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and Mukuro choked out when they realized the abnormality.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐it was too late. With a single breath, Origami swung both of her hands down. "‐'Artelif'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, as if responding to Origami's words, the 'feathers' formed into a crown above Kotori's and Mukuro's heads, one by one, pouring down huge pillars of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was Origami's last resort.</p>
<p class="null-p">The countless attacks of 'Kadour' were just a distraction to hide the second attack from 'Artelif'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and Mukuro let out a silent scream‐as they were swallowed by the light.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if both of them had their powers liberated, they definitely wouldn't be safe after taking a direct hit from 'Artelif'. Origami, despite believing in victory, still did not neglect continuously releasing her reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……'Cama……el'‐'Megiddo'……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Amidst the flow of glowing reiryoku, looming over a squirming shadow, the next moment a deep crimson pillar of fire shot straight towards Origami's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just in time, Origami turned her body. The position Origami had been standing a second before had been penetrated through by the burning flames. The tremendous heat pierced through the sky</p>
<p class="null-p">and scotched the skin to the point she thought that her entire body</p>
<p class="null-p">would have been burned, even without direct contact if she wasn't wearing her Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..It's……a pity……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, who was equipped with 'Camael' transformed into a cannon barrel on one side of her arm, smiled with regret. She left those words as she slowly fell to the ground. ‐Her Angel and Astral Dress on her body gradually turned into beautiful particles of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">An unbelievable endurance and tenacity, Origami couldn't help but admire her. Even when her body was sunk in 'Metatron' all-out attack, it was unexpected that she could still counterattack at that level.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">But things haven't ended yet. Feeling new movements, she immediately twisted her body in the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, because her posture was disrupted by avoiding Kotori's</p>
<p class="null-p">'Megiddo', her movements were delayed by a second. And so‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Nushi-sama‐won't deliver to anyone……"</p>
<p class="null-p">With Mukuro as an opponent, that opportunity was fatal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro, wearing a battered Astral Dress appeared from the void, stabbing her cracked Angel forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Michael's blade reached Origami's Astral Dress. In the next moment, Mukuro turned 'Michael' while shouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Michael'‐'Jerez'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, from the starting point of 'Michael's tip‐Origami's Astral Dress was broken down into fine dust.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, drifting in the sky without a single cloth covering her body, felt her consciousness being pulled far away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Aaaaaa‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Passion surged throughout her entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">While gripping the handle of 'Michael' that had been badly damaged, Mukuro was about to collapse. With tears in her eyes, she gave a victorious scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">Below her, Kotori had fallen down and lost her Angel. In front of her, Origami was unconscious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both were powerful enemies that caused her to shudder. In fact, Mukuro was about to reach her limit. It was very difficult to maintain her Astral Dress and Angel since she used a considerable amount of reiryoku to protect herself from 'Metatron's attack. If they were damaged any more, it would be difficult to re-summon for a second time.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐the winner was Mukuro. The last person standing firm in this sky was Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, she couldn't celebrate yet. Indeed, this difficult battle was over, Mukuro had eliminated</p>
<p class="null-p">two formidable opponents. But in this natural park, there may still be other Spirits left.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, everything had not ended. She should let her body temporarily rest and grasp the situation</p>
<p class="null-p">around‐ Then. "‐Ugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro was suffocating from the tension.</p>
<p class="null-p">A murderous intent covered all of Mukuro's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">She immediately understood the reason. At some point, 'Metatron', which had disappeared the same time Origami lost consciousness, was now surrounding her again. "Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the unexpected situation, Mukuro widened her eyes. ‐Surely, with the Astral Dress destroyed by 'Jerez', even Origami must have lost her fighting ability‐!?</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Mukuro realized that the countless 'feathers' surrounding her, their shape was slightly different from 'Metatron'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a jet-black 'feather' condensed in darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro had seen this once before.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. This was‐ "‐I'm sorry, Mukuro-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if interrupting Mukuro's thoughts, a voice from below rang out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at this, she saw that Origami's body, which should have lost consciousness, was still floating.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, slowly raised her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">In those eyes, the burning flames of determination were different from the usual Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I also‐cannot lose. Because I‐love Itsuka-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Thou‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving a bombardment focused from the jet black 'feathers', Mukuro lost her Astral Dress along with her consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Remaining Spirits, 2 out of 10.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……, Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking in a short breath, Origami regained consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had dozed off for a moment. Origami instantly strained her body and understood her current situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was falling from the sky. As soon as she realized that, Origami concentrated her mind to allow her body to float.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she looked at her own body. There was no Astral Dress left on her body‐but she could sense a faint amount of reiryoku within herself. Otherwise, she wouldn't be able to even fly in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Exhaling for a brief moment, she found the reiryoku needed to make an Astral Dress manifest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was less reassuring than even a limited Astral Dress, her body was covered by a thin layer of silky reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Very close to her limits. Very close‐but not reached yet. Origami frowned at this mysterious feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami should have used her reiryoku to the limit. Despite the imperfect condition, she didn't believe she could summon her Astral Dress again. It felt as if this reiryoku was handed out by someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were no signs of Kotori or Mukuro around. She remembered that she had defeated Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at the next moment, she should have been taken down by</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro. But this was‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Origami found something on the ground as she descended on that spot. Landing softly on the ground‐she walked over to the girl who had fallen there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Mukuro."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, over there was Mukuro in a state of slumber after losing her Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was confused. The situation appeared as if she had beaten Mukuro through some means. But Origami had no memory of that</p>
<p class="null-p">occurring. Even for a moment, she had completely lost consciousness. Did her body strike back on its own‐?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami didn't think any further. She hadn't given up pondering it over, but decided that now was not the time for this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless of what happen, it was Origami, not Mukuro, who won. Therefore, she had to prepare for the next battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, despite defeating the dangerous Spirits Kotori and Mukuro, Origami had also received considerable damage. Despite it not being clear who was left now‐ Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami hurriedly turned backwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although faint, she could hear some sound coming from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, as if aware of being discovered by Origami, the source of that sound slammed at the ground at an alarming speed to approach Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Metatron'……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She concentrated her mind to make her Angel appear. Only a single</p>
<p class="null-p">'feather' manifested but that</p>
<p class="null-p">was already a miracle in of itself for the current Origami. She aimed and fired her ray of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the mysterious assailant spun her body like a bullet, dodging 'Metatron's ray of light while maintain the momentum towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As her consciousness compressed at that moment, she began thinking at a high speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who is this?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and Mukuro were no longer a threat. And obviously this speed couldn't come from Natsumi, Nia, or Miku. If so, then was it Kaguya or Yuzuru? No, likely the one with greatest chance of winning now was Kurumi‐</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, Origami finally caught the appearance of the attacker.</p>
<p class="null-p">There, full of wounds, covered in silver armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Yoshino‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After finally saying that, Origami's consciousness sank into darkness again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Remaining Spirits, out of 10, leftover‐</p>
<p class="null-h1">Fragmentary Chapter 5: Dear</p>
<p class="null-p">(…………)</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps due to switching over with her other self on the surface repeatedly‐it became possible to perceive bits and pieces of the world through Tohka's senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, not only that. The movement of Tohka's emotions that were always felt until now could be grasped more clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had little time to feel bored anymore. The place where Tohka lived. The school that Tohka attended. The food eaten by Tohka. The daily life that Tohka enjoyed‐the information of such things flowed in little by little through her ears and eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">In such a daily life, that man was always at the center‐Shidou. When eating delicious food, Tohka's heart felt pleasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">When looking at something beautiful, Tohka's heart felt happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">When doing something fun, Tohka's heart raced in excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">But whenever this was done with Shidou, the feeling transmitted to her would be amplified several times over.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, not only that. Whenever looking at him, Tohka's heart sprouted a mysterious feeling that couldn't be described when looking at anything else. (This is……) Gradually, she grew interested in the feeling that Shidou brought about in Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time Shidou was reflected in Tohka's eyes, she would follow after that figure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she slowly understood it. This is. This feeling is‐</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: The Benevolent God</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Now, what do you think Tenka? From here, you can see all of Tenguu City."</p>
<p class="null-p">Climbing over a long flight of stairs and reaching a hilltop park, Tohka spoke in a somewhat proud manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. This was the park they visited last year when Shidou and Tohka went on their first date. Located at the end of the staircase and extending alongside the plateau, it was a scene suitable for being called a superb view. Despite being a little laborious to come here, this spot alone was worth it.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, after looking around, Tenka moved her lips as if noticing something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……aah, here. I remember from inside your‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu, what was that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka grew despondent hearing what Tenka had said. So, Tenka quickly shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I remembered wrong. This is the first time. Tell me about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Ooh, is that so!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's expression brightened. Seeing this, Tenka let out a soft sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haha."</p>
<p class="null-p">What was contained in that sigh was neither inconvenience nor boredom, but rather a feeling close to a peace of mind. Looking at this, Shidou involuntarily loosen his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Tenka's goal was still not known and she also didn't change from being an opponent where even the slightest hint of negligence couldn't be afforded. However, when spending time together like this, he couldn't help but see Tohka and Tenka as a younger sister that wanted to introduce what she treasured and an older sister who cared about her younger sibling the most.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, these were Tohka's actual feelings. After passing through the row of cherry blossoms, Shidou and Tenka were led by Tohka to various places‐and these places, restaurants and game centers, were all locations Tohka had previously been before with Shidou or the other Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, as her other self, she couldn't wait to show all of this to Tenka.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fun things she had seen in this world. The happy times spent with everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou narrowed his eyes deeply moved, Tohka clapped her hands together as if remembering something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, eating soft serve ice cream while watching this scenery is also excellent……hold on. I'll go to the store below and buy some!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Then I'll also go‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No! You two sit on this bench for a while!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka raised her palm to interrupt Shidou's words. Before he could finish speaking, she had</p>
<p class="null-p">already rushed down the stairs they had climbed up. ……Indeed, rather than Shidou helping, it seemed Tohka would be able to finish this much faster by herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">But in this manner, a new problem had arisen. Shidou, who was left alone with Tenka in this park now that Tohka was gone, fell silent as his cheeks dripped with cold sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">With today's date, his impression of Tenka had changed. However, that was only the case when</p>
<p class="null-p">with Tohka and her attitude towards Shidou hasn't changed much since the beginning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, he couldn't let this silence continue further. From the beginning, today's date was intended to be with Tenka. If he couldn't open her heart, it would probably be impossible to seal her reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">From this perspective, this moment was brought by Tohka's consideration. Considering that over,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched his fist to encourage himself forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-anyway……let's sit down first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hm."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a brief response, Tenka sat down on the bench facing the outer edge of the park.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she unexpectedly responded back‐this just likely obeying the words that Tohka had left. The outcome of deciding victory or defeat in this match had just begun. Shidou sat down besides Tenka as he continued to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey‐how was it today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I enjoyed it. It seems like Tohka also did as well. Is there any place that you liked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like the rows of cherry blossoms or the game hall. D-did you find the sakuramochi delicious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou tried to nonchalantly throw a topic to talk about, Tenka merely just looked silently at the cityscape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muguu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite Shidou's mind already feeling dejected, he still couldn't afford to give up. He</p>
<p class="null-p">desperately tried to think over if there was a topic that would warrant Tenka's interest. "Ah, that's right Tenka. Um‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Why has it become like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, as if to interrupt Shidou, Tenka muttered coldly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……? W-what are you saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"All of today. ‐Why did Tohka manifest me? Why did she bring me along on your date? Isn't it Tohka's wish to be with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's words came to a halt here.</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't on the account of Shidou not being able to reply back. The reason why Tohka invited Tenka on this date was because she wanted to enjoy it with Tenka. She only wanted to show her other self the wonderful things that she knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou still felt concerned.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka's words. ‐Why was Tenka saying this.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no exaggeration that Tenka was a godlike entity at the moment. But that was why Shidou felt a sense of incongruity. Being easily swayed by Tohka‐no, it was as if Tohka was at the center of this world so to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tenka, you‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Shidou subconsciously raised the question.</p>
<p class="null-p">A question he had already been asked once. ‐The question that became the starting point for all other questions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Why did you create this world?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Shidou had asked, Tenka swayed her brow as it twitched.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her expression, Shidou thought for a split second that he had made an error. However, having already been said, there was no way out anymore. Moreover, this was something that needed to be addressed eventually.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka stayed silent for a while, but eventually she snorted from her nose and raised her chin to look down on Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I already said, it was because I thought it wasn't bad to possess the world at the palm of my hands‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐That's a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou spoke while staring directly at her, Tenka frowned while lightly clicking her tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You speak quite self-confidently, human. Need there be a reason to pursue strength? Why would I lie?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That‐I don't understand. But, no matter what, I don't believe you did this for that reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How comical. What the hell do you know about me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐I know. At the very least, you love Tohka and it's in your natural disposition to never</p>
<p class="null-p">concede. And also‐you are really kind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You bastard."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time Shidou said that, Tenka breathed out in anger as she suddenly stood up from the bench. In an instant, as if conveying her annoyance, she radiated an invisible shockwave from her body. The bench was crushed, the ground caved in, and the nearby fence was released into the sky. Even Shidou was not spared as he was blown away from that spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite rolling on the ground, Shidou quickly stood up to face Tenka. Seeing Shidou like this, Tenka narrowed her eyes in a moody manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tolerating your insolence and mockery ends now. Raise your head. I'll detach your head from your shoulders."</p>
<p class="null-p">While speaking, she raised her right hand. Then, jet-black light gathered there to form a giant sword. ‐'Nahemah'. It was the Demon King wielded by Tenka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Confronted by this ominous feeling of dread, Shidou involuntarily felt his eyebrows tense up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having spent a day together, Shidou felt that Tenka wouldn't seriously try to kill him. But what</p>
<p class="null-p">was now being emitted from Tenka was unmistakably clear murderous intent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did he have the wrong impression or did Shidou say enough for Tenka to change her mind? Although it wasn't clear which one it was, he could indeed be killed like this. Shidou sharpened his gaze, concentrated his mind as he shouted loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Sandalphon'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to his call, the Angel of the Sword that formed a pair with 'Nahemah' had manifested. Shidou gripped the hilt as he assumed a stance while feeling cold sweat from the tension.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Sandalphon' huh. How courageous of you to choose that to cross swords with me." Tenka kept a cold look as she raised 'Nahemah', closing in on Shidou in a split second. "Ku……!" With his life hanging by thread, Shidou parried the sword swung downward. Each time the reiryoku of the Angel and Demon King clashed with each other, a huge shockwave was dispersed to their surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ho, you stopped it. But how long can you persist with something of that level."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku‐aaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou ignored the screams within his body as used all of his strength to deflect 'Nahemah' and swing 'Sandalphon' forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, he didn't believe that such an attack would work on Tenka. He predicted that the results would either be blocked or avoided. However, since it was impossible to keep receiving Tenka's attacks forever, there was no other choice but to initiate this attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou held his breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as Shidou swung down with 'Sandalphon', Tenka relaxed both of her hands and let</p>
<p class="null-p">'Nahemah' fall from her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if‐she was prepared to accept Shidou's attack. "‐" Shidou rushed to change the aim of his swing. However, it was extremely difficult to divert the path of 'Sandalphon' once it was already been swung down. The Angel of the sword was poised to cut down Tenka's unprotected shoulders‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, just at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking that such a cry echoed, Shidou felt an impact collide at the right side of his body as he was pushed to the ground by that force.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch……T-Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although astonished by what just had happened, Shidou called out the name of the girl who rushed to embrace him. She was in such a panic that the soft served ice cream in her hands was thrown aside to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, although I don't know what happened, please calm down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka is not a bad Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka created this world‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka raised her voice to stop Tohka. However, Tohka didn't pay attention to this as she continued to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Tenka created this world, all for my sake."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Haah, this really is another huge mess."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing the CR-Unit 'Vánargandr', Mana, who was floating in the sky, sighed while watching the scene below.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was also a matter of course. After all, in Mana's field of vision were the massive ruins of destruction that gave the impression of being over 100 years of accumulated catastrophes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The trees were torn down, the ground was hollowed out, and the well maintained sports facilities and public plaza no longer left even a vestige of their former appearance. If showing a photo of this scene to an unaware stranger, it would likely be described with the words "Monster Movie", "Open Field before Sowing Seeds", and "Chocolate Cereal". From this horrible picture, it was unimaginable that this was a green nature park just a few hours ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Tohka-san's power is sealed, the entire world will be restored to how it once was but……ah, ah, really."</p>
<p class="null-p">Recognizing the power and dread of the existence of a Spirit again, Mana sighed once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite this, as a result of the fierce battle, the dense remnants of reiryoku could be felt in the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Oh, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana shook her eyebrows as if suddenly remembering something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was overlooked for a while due to the many violent acts of the Spirits, there was another reason for why Mana had come to this natural park.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. In order to search for Spirits that had already exhausted their reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">After receiving the report for the end of the battle, Mana cooperated with 'Ratatoskr's personnel to protect the Spirits……but as of now, there was still some Spirits who weren't found.</p>
<p class="null-p">She issued a command in her brain to activate the Realizer manifestation device mounted on ' Vánargandr'. Then, a map of the surrounding area was projected onto Mana's retina. ……Of course, the terrain has changed drastically from the original topography, so it could only be used for rough coordinates.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mana smiled wistfully, the projected map displayed an icon indicating a life response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Oh, it's over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana turned around in the sky and propelled her thrusters to descend straight down to the location indicated by the icon.</p>
<p class="null-p">She twisted her body as she landed on the ground. The ensuing wind pressure swayed the leaves of the trees that still remained around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying so, she walked to the side of the Spirit who was there‐'Ratatoskr' commander Itsuka Kotori was laying on the fallen leaves, in a scandalous appearance after losing her Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori-san, Kotori-san. Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After shaking her shoulders, Kotori let out a small groan as she slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm……Ma, na……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Thanks for the hard work."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana smiled while replying back. Kotori then observed her surroundings before looking down at herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐she immediately stood up, covering her body with her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mana, what did you do……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please calm down, Kotori-san. You're still only half-awake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being reminded, Kotori was able to recall the situation. After glancing at her own appearance again, she let out a heavy sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah‐yeah. I lost."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfortunately, that seems to be the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mana said that, she took out a set of replacement clothes from a bag and handed it over to Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please. Although it has gotten warmer, you'll catch a cold if you stay like that forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un……thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no. Compared to that, are you okay to stand up? Everyone has gathered together. ……Aah, of course, the search was only done by female personnel, so please rest assured."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't miss that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori laughed as she spoke, letting out a sigh and putting her sleeves on before inquiring.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Speaking of which, who eventually won at the end? Origami? Or Mukuro? No, it may have</p>
<p class="null-p">been a Spirit that wasn't there at that time. So then……was it</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori spoke with an uneasy look, Mana lowered her gaze while shaking her head slowly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The winner‐seems to be Yoshino-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Mana had said, Kotori widened her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino? You're saying Yoshino……that Yoshino?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Well, that's just what Mana has heard. If there is another</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino-san besides the one</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana is familiar with, maybe it's that one."</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Mana reply in a joking manner, Kotori crossed her arms with an astonished look.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it wasn't as if she couldn't understand that reaction. In fact, Mana had a similar</p>
<p class="null-p">response when she had first asked Maria about the results of the battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was not to say that Yoshino's power was inferior to other Spirits. Yoshino's 'Zadkiel', which could control cold air and water, was a mighty Angel not to be outdone. Depending on the method of fighting, there was indeed a chance for victory.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, due to her gentle personality, pacifistic nature, and usual calm demeanor, one would not make an immediate connection between Yoshino and victory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……Yoshino."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……Maria was also very surprised."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana gave an exaggerated nod before shrugging her shoulders. As an aside, since Nia was defeated midway, the individuals onboard 'Fraxinus' had also disappeared and Maria was forced to complain using the speaker on the bridge again. It seemed that she wouldn't be humoring Nia with any tasty snacks for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, come over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana reached out her hand to help Kotori stand up. Then, she covered her Territory around</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's body as they both ascended up into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">After flying low for about a minute, they reached where the other Spirits were being looked after just like Kotori. The appearance of</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ratatoskr's female staff members could also be seen around. Now, everyone had changed clothes and footwear, with hot drinks being distributed around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Mana-san, Kotori-san! Over here, over here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku, who noticed Mana and Kotori approaching, was vigorously waving her hand. Although Mana noticed that her left hand seemed to be clinging onto someone resembling Natsumi, she decided to ignore this as she landed on the ground once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hi, everyone. How are you all feeling?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori smiled while walking towards everyone. In response, the Spirits also returned the smile while giving a collective shrug.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, fighting against each other wasn't bad. But it's a shame that</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't win."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. Standing up and clashing against each other in earnest was quite a comfortable feeling."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn! Sure enough, this sort of thing isn't fair! Let's try a written test contest next time imōto- chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, while there were some Spirits like Nia who were expressing their regrets, generally speaking everyone had a refreshed look from using all of their strength. Kotori gently sighed as she turned to face Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've heard about the results. ‐Congratulations, Yoshino."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Kotori had said, Yoshino slightly trembled as she shrank her shoulders back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank……you. But……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The winner should be more grandiose, Yoshino-san. Please be more confident. You won by</p>
<p class="null-p">being the last one standing among the Spirits."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mana was speaking, Yoshino frowned in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um……really‐can it be counted as my win?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, after seemingly escaping from Miku's clutches, Natsumi raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Natsumi-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Are you still saying that? That's no good. A win is a win. That person said so as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-alright……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Natsumi had said, Yoshino hesitated for a moment before nodding. Listening on to their conversation, Mana inclined her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person‐who is that? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino was about to speak‐ "‐Kihihi, hihi." Ominous laughter erupted from somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Tokisaki Kurumi‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mana cautiously called out that name, the shadows on the ground distorted with Kurumi emerging from there in a black and red dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. Thank you for the hard work sheltering everyone, Manasan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at her appearance, Mana raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Kurumi's body right now was still wearing an Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi was also a participant in the battle royal. Moreover, that conflict had already come to an end with Yoshino's victory. In other words, Kurumi should have also been defeated by someone during this and it would be strange if she was not in a state where she could no longer manifest her Angel or Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps noticing Mana thinking this, Kurumi raised the corners of her lips to smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Please rest assured. I have already lost. I have no intention of nitpicking Yoshino-san's victory."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If so, then what's that thing fluttering on your body? Wasn't the condition for defeat to exhaust your reiryoku to the point where you are unable to manifest an Angel or Astral Dress?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. You're right. As you can see‐I was defeated by Yoshinosan to the point where I can no longer reveal the Angel 'Rasiel' or 'Spirit Dress of God's</p>
<p class="null-p">Authority no. 2'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana narrowed her eyes upon hearing Kurumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon a closer look, what she was wearing now was‐the Gothic Lolita style skirt before taking in Nia's Sephira Crystal. "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, that judgement wasn't impossible if twisting the interpretation of the rules a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, for the sake of victory, Mana couldn't understand why she would act to use a loophole in order to be defeated. She snorted from her nose ever so unpleasantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's just trifling with cheap sophistry. What the hell are you planning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, for a very simple reason. I needed to retain my reiryoku even after the battle royal was over. ‐In order to complete some unfinished business."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfinished business?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mana furrowed her brow while asking, Kurumi continued to smile fearlessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she pulled two ancient pistols from the shadows and directed both of them towards Mana.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐After thinking it over, I wish to properly settle this dispute with Mana-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Kurumi's smile grew darker. Confronted by this unexpected situation, the Spirits were all noisily in an uproar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha……w-what are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Why are you pointing a gun at a friend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits all spoke out one by one. However, Kurumi didn't remove her faint smile and lose sight of Mana.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……To pull out gun, that's troubling even if it's a joke."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara. You're still intending to allow me to treat it as a joke? Is it because of being part of</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ratatoskr', that you think I've become too soft‐well!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a cry, the trigger was pulled. From Kurumi's rifle and pistol, dark shadows solidified into bullets were shot in rapid succession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Mana, with her vision and reaction time enhanced by the Territory, captured the trajectory of the bullets and unswervingly sank her body to dodge the blows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine. My body was aching watching everyone fight anyway. I'll perform your last rites now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana kicked against the ground, using that momentum to avoid the bullets and narrow the distance to Kurumi in an instant. She extended out 'Wolftail' in her right, brandishing it in order to aim at mowing down Kurumi's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kihi‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kurumi, having foreseen this attack, reclined back to avoid the blow at a very close margin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite this, Mana had already predicted something of that level.</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened her left hand</p>
<p class="null-p">'Wolffang' in order to continue chasing after Kurumi, whose</p>
<p class="null-p">posture had crumbled‐ "Wha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Mana's breathing collapsed.</p>
<p class="null-p">As her consciousness was sharpened to the limit through the domain of her voluntary territory, the sight of a muzzle being pulled out from the shadow on the ground was reflected in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she hurriedly tried to pull back, it was already too late. Accompanied by an icy low</p>
<p class="null-p">pitched sound, the bullet fired had struck Mana's neck. "Ku‐ah……!" With a cry of anguish, Mana collapsed onto the ground. Kotori and the others quickly rushed over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mana!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-are you alright!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the Spirits' voices being full of concern, another Kurumi emerged from the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Likely it was the original Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu. It's not like Mana-san to be fooled by such a low level approach."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But if Mana-san was really serious, my head would have been already detached from my neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she was really trying to kill me, she would have taken one more step forward."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kurumi first present‐or rather a clone spoke while stroking her neck. Then, the original Kurumi opened her eyes in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ara, ara. In other words, you were trying to make me powerless without killing me. You've really become‐so gentle."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi sighed before continuing to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Gu‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While listening to such voices, Mana touched her neck with her trembling hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">No pain. Bleeding‐was absent as well. In other words, this was no ordinary bullet. So</p>
<p class="null-p">which bullet was it? Since time hadn't stopped it wasn't the Seventh Bullet 'Zayin'. Then‐ "……Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, Mana felt the contents of her head overwhelmed like a spectacular mess. She felt a dreadful dizziness as the urge to vomit surged like the raging waves. Her field of vision flickered as her body collapsed from the anguish of being stun like a pincushion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mana! Mana! Hey, Kurumi……! What did you just do to Mana!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's angry voice echoed in her head. Then, she heard Kurumi laughing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I already say it? I've come to properly settle this dispute. ‐But, it is disappointing that Mana-san really wasn't planning on killing me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell are you talking about‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Aaaaaaaaaaaa‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to interrupt Kotori, Mana screamed like a ferocious beast.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as the feeling snarling her head began to settle down, she powerlessly tried to stand up while sweating profusely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mana!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shook her shoulders. Mana somehow managed to adjust her breathing as she raised her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori……san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she suddenly noticed that something was amiss. ‐Her body felt heavy. There was no freedom in her limbs as if her body was bounded by a mass of iron.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking of this, Mana changed her mode of thought. Certainly, her body was currently dressed in a mass of metal called the CR-Unit. The reason she was able to move freely was because her entire body was wrapped in the Voluntary Territory. Does that mean Kurumi's bullet inhibited the formation of the Voluntary Territory?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………, ……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, while considering that possibility, Mana looked up at Kurumi with a stinging glare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, isn't that unsightly look of crawling on the ground quite suitable for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It feels disgusting. ‐Rather than dying, to be saved by you." As Mana spoke while distorting her lips, Kurumi smiled happily once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ara, ara. I intended to pull them all out, but it seems there was one fang left."</p>
<p class="null-p">While listening to that joke, Mana lowered her head as she lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"For Tohka‐this world was created……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was left confused, alternating between staring at Tohka who was hugging him and Tenka whose expression remained unchanged.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Tohka opened her lips to begin to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Umu. After making Tenka appear in the classroom, a little bit of her consciousness flowed</p>
<p class="null-p">into my head. It was just like the feeling of the pathway of the seal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt his throat gulp as he reached out for Tohka's extended hand to stand back up.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that was it, Shidou remembered that sensation. When sealing a Spirits' reiryoku through a kiss, part of that Spirits consciousness or memories might flow in as well. Not to mention Tohka and Tenka were a pair that shared the same body. It wasn't unthinkable to imagine this would happen with those two living a shared existence juxtaposed with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Sorry Shidou. I should have told you earlier. But……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's okay. ……Compared to that, thank you for stopping me,</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka. If I continued like that, I might have cut Tenka."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, he didn't believe that single blow from himself was enough to kill Tenka. Staring</p>
<p class="null-p">at Tenka while thinking over this, Tenka snorted from her nose in displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An unnecessary act. Even 'Sandalphon' used by that human is enough to break this temporary body. ‐There's not much time left. At the very least, you should spend the remaining time left alone together with that human." "Tenka……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's expression changed quite sadly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at this exchange between these two, Shidou felt his expression tense up even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a moment, I can't keep up. What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to what Shidou was asking, both Tohka and Tenka closed their mouths. But after a while, Tohka seemed determined to raise her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you remember Shidou? When we fought against Mio, before</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou used the Sixth Bullet</p>
<p class="null-p">'Vav'‐the world where all of the Spirits were killed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"! That's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped for air in vain. Needless to say, that event was deeply engraved in his memories‐but he didn't expect Tohka to remember the world before it was changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was reasonable when considering it over. The current</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka had taken in Mio's</p>
<p class="null-p">Sephira Crystal within her body. So even if she knew this, it wasn't unbelievable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……I remember. At that time‐I had given up when Tohka saved me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Umu. That's exactly it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Tohka continued on while keeping a distant look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At that time, all of the Spirits were deprived of their Sephira</p>
<p class="null-p">Crystals by Mio and died from</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ain Soph Aur'. ‐But, only I somehow managed to recover within</p>
<p class="null-p">Mio's consciousness. It was thanks to Tenka being there." "……Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka turned towards her, Tenka averted her eyes away. Although her expression was still cold, her behavior seemed to be acting to cover up her own embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just a voice calling out. There was a more fundamental reason why Tohka could wake up in that woman's body. ‐You best remember, human. The Spirits whose Sephira were taken by that woman were exposed as human corpses. But only for Tohka, even her body didn't remain." "Umu‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nodding to Tenka's words, Tohka turned over to look at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone else were ex-humans who were turned into Spirits by Mio's hands. But I alone‐had been born as a personality from within the Sephira Crystal, a pure Spirit so to speak."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou nodded silently. ‐He had already known this. It was because he had heard it from Tohka herself before sending his consciousness back to the past through the Sixth Bullet 'Vav'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Tenka softly sighed while picking the topic back up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Spirits are that woman‐Takamiya Mio and those granted Sephira Crystals by her. Even when tracing the source of that power, all of it still belongs to Takamiya Mio."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me, what does that mean?" ‐Thump.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt his heart pound violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what will happen to the Spirits now that woman has disappeared? What about the Sephira Crystal within our body?" ‐Thump, thump.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heartbeat grew even fiercer.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if report a danger to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">The words that will follow‐as if begging him to not listen to that. But the truth was mercilessly told.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐With the elimination of Takamiya Mio, the powers of all of the Spirits will disappear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything will return back to normal. Humans will be restored back to humans, but those that lack a vessel‐will revert back into nothingness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">A fierce dizziness attacked his entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart rang like than the morning bell, his breathing became shallower and faster, sweat spewed out from his pores as his back was soaked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just now, what did Tenka say?</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, he suspected that his ears and head were out of order. No‐this wasn't a suspicion but rather a wish. Every cell composing his body was trying to reject the information that was just provided. How can he deny this? It didn't matter if this was a bad joke that Tenka rushed. He hoped desperately she would huff coldly in her usual manner and inform him that was a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">With movements like a rusty machine, Shidou turned to Tohka for his final salvation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Tohka's sad smile shattered all of his last hopes. "Hey……please wait. This……what, ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">A hoarse voice emerged from his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka gently reached to cover Shidou's shivering hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Mio's Sephira Crystal disappears, I will also disappear. Tenka, who realized this, absorbed that Sephira crystal in order to create this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">All so I could spend a little more time with everyone before everything ends."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing Tohka's words, Tenka silently looked away while crossing her arms. But that silence was more eloquent in conveying her kindness than mere words could. "Toh, ka……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was trapped in a mess of thoughts, not knowing what to say other than dumbly call out her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐……"</p>
<p class="null-p">But then he noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's hand, which was grabbing his own, was also slightly trembling. "‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, Shidou's confusion was met with the feeling of cold water being splashed on his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because Tohka's condition was extremely calm, he hadn't been able to notice such a natural thing until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hopeless information had brought a sudden shock. It was natural to be confused and desperate, shuddering while feeling helpless.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the one definitely most afraid‐was Tohka herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet, Tohka still had a gentle expression while quietly telling the truth to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why? ‐She had decided. To prevent Shidou from being scared. To not spent the last of her limited time crying and filled with grief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, he couldn't remain like this. Shidou suppressed violent emotions bustling within his heart as he tightly gripped Tohka's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Shidou‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Tohka, I……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, just as Shidou was trying to convey his decision to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!? Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if the world was pulsating, an earthquake trembled. Then, the sky lost its color as if having been bleached‐from the horizon a crack emerged. It seemed as if there was a huge existence trying to crush the world itself. Confronted by this abnormal phenomenon, Shidou couldn't help but widen his eyes. "This, is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to interrupt Shidou's voice, Tenka squinted while looking up at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because you were so slow, it is already coming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Coming……what are you saying!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked while yelling, Tenka kept staring at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐The end of this world."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Kurumi, will you explain this to us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lifting her gaze from Mana on the floor, Kotori let out a voice marked with doubt.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kurumi, who was under Kotori's scrutiny, merely gave a playful smile while shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Kurumi had shot Mana. However, there wasn't a single wound on Mana, who had received the bullet. Despite losing consciousness, her pulse was still stable. Kurumi, in the end she‐</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori was considering this over, Origami came from behind and squatted down to observe</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana's condition. She opened the lid on the back of the CR-Unit and frowned slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐This is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, what happened, Origami."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori asked, Origami pointed to the flashing red light on the back of the device.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Realizer of 'Vánargandr' has failed. The commands from the transmitter have not been</p>
<p class="null-p">received. To be more precise, the response itself is gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! That means that‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It's just like an average person who is not a Wizard wearing the device."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami lowered her eyes to focus on what seemed to be a button on the back of the device.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, Mana's body faintly glowed as the CR-Unit returned back to being the emergency dressing device. Origami carried Mana, who was now in her civilian clothes, so that she could lie on a blanket set by one of 'Ratatoskr'staff members.</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking at this scene, Kotori turned her attention towards Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Kurumi, no way you‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Kihihi, hihi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi playfully laughed while shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if matching with that, the gun in her hands, her Astral Dress, even her clone, all melted away in the shadows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a full-fledged Fourth Bullet 'Dalet' with all of the reiryoku left within me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are fangs and claws truly necessary for a wolf that has lost its killing intent?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Kurumi say that, Kotori was at a loss for words. Then, the voices from the puzzled Spirits echoed from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um……what does this mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mana-san……will she be okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori glanced over to them, nodding a "yes" to them with sweat dripping down her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……As everyone knows, here is an ideal world created by Tohka. Everything is convenient, everything goes smoothly. Even DEM's magic treatment that eroded Mana's body has become 'nonexistent'. However, if Shidou's date goes smoothly, the world will be restored to its original state. ‐That of course means Mana's body as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Then you're saying‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amazement. I can't believe it all at once."</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon listening to Kotori, the Spirits all turned to Kurumi with widened eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone probably understood. ‐Kurumi had used rewinding time ability of the Fourth Bullet</p>
<p class="null-p">'Dalet' to restore Mana's body to a state before DEM's magic treatment had occurred. "‐Ara, ara. I'll be embarrassed if everyone stares so much."</p>
<p class="null-p">With everyone's attention on her, Kurumi twisted her naked body. Kotori sighed at this gesture as she took out a change of clothes from a bag that a staff member had brought and threw it to Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Change of clothes. Can't you not always be like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My apologizes for imposing on your care."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said while changing clothes. Miku's voice was heard yelling,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Just a little</p>
<p class="null-p">longer‐!" from behind. However, Kotori choose to ignore this for the time being as she turned to speak to Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Thank you. Compared to that, she's okay now? That child is almost like my little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, what a surprise. I thought that you and Mana have been mutually trying to kill each other for a while now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori spoke, Kurumi lightly shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Certainly, a lot of 'us' have been killed by Mana-san……but in the end that was all DEM's doing. And‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I don't hate it. An 'ally of justice' like Mana-san." After frivolously saying those words, Kurumi smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was difficult to judge if this was intentionally a joke, but feeling that those words</p>
<p class="null-p">were too mismatched for Kurumi, Kotori couldn't help but smile as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐it was just at this moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">The surrounding air trembled just like an earthquake as the sky was bleached white.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha……!? W-what is this……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya‐!? A cataclysm!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately, the voices of the surrounding Spirits were full of confusion and panic. During that time, Kurumi quietly looked up at the sky and muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara. Finally, is it time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi, do you know what is happening!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. To express it simply……this world is about to reach its end."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi sighed a little as she spoke. In turn, Kotori let out a</p>
<p class="null-p">"wha…..!" as her eyes widened. "It can't be, you're saying that</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou didn't make it in time!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, another Spirit came from behind to console Kotori. ‐It was Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Okay, okay, calm down imoto-chan. It's not over yet. Probably not."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed just like Kurumi, Nia had expected this to occur. She continued to speak in an extremely calm manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've done all we can do. What happens next depends on boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">We need to believe in him and wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori furrowed her brow anxiously, Nia placed her finger in front of Kotori's lips to prevent her from speaking. Then, she continued to speak while giving a wink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should know that boy is at his coolest during these moments, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Nia, Kotori gently sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in the same manner, the Spirits that all looked uneasy also realized this. They then turned to each other and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……if it is Shidou-san, I'm sure it will be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……I have faith in Nushi-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka, we have already done this far. He is not the sort of man who would waste that in vain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Trust. No matter what sort of opponent, Shidou will definitely prevail."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right‐. Even Inverse Tohka-san will surely be defeated!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. One would have to be certainly weak to lose to a woman like her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is that okay since that Tohka seems to be the ruler of this world? Can't she hear you say that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that manner, everyone spoke out in turn. Hearing their voices, Kotori exhaled gently while scratching her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……All right, everyone is daring to throw me out and boast like a little sister would. ‐In that</p>
<p class="null-p">case, it is also impossible for me to not believe in him."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori spoke, the Spirits strongly nodded in agreement. Kurumi looked at them with satisfaction before turning to the sky. "Now Shidou-san. The next step is your moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Come slowly, please don't regret it."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Cracks emerged from the sky, peeling off just like an eggshell.</p>
<p class="null-p">The surface of the ground creaked as the constant tremors resounded like a scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the feeling that a single creature known as the world was about reach the end of its life. Looking at this horrifically illusory scene, Shidou lost the ability to speak for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, among them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka, standing at the edge of the park, didn't tremble at all as she snapped her fingers. Immediately afterwards, the ice cream that Tohka had dropped earlier was restored to its original state and settled into Tenka's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka continued on while licking the ice cream.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it turned out to be a superb view. ‐Staring at the end of the world with ice cream in hand feels unexpectedly quite good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, what are you doing!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Faced with Tenka's unexpected move, Shidou couldn't help but scream. Then, Tenka turned her eyes to glare at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing. Are you going to waste the snacks that Tohka brought?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I didn't mean that‐mogaah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of speaking, Shidou felt his eyes forcibly rolled back. The second ice cream, which</p>
<p class="null-p">had been restored in rhythm to Tenka's finger movements, had leaped into his mouth. "S-Shidou! Are you alright!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka asked quite worriedly. Incidentally, the last ice cream had</p>
<p class="null-p">gently landed on Tohka's hands. "Uhuh……ugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou forcibly swallowed the ice cream shoved in his mouth and nodded to respond back to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if to follow this, the shaking from the world grew stronger‐ An enormous 'something' appeared amidst the fallen sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐what……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking to the sky, his voice leaked out as he was overcome by surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">That thing‐it was an enormous hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">A radiant white hand shone from the other end of the broken sky, shattering the remaining portions of the original sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, like bathing in the debris in the sky, the owner of that hand emerged. Seeing that, Shidou felt his breathing clog up.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't impossible either. Rather than that appearance being completely unknown to</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou‐it was because it was known that he fell into physical disorder.</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing on top of the heavens, a giant.</p>
<p class="null-p">The figure of a beautiful girl with long hair was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">An expressionless face. A pair of eyes that lack any sort of consciousness. Except for that long hair, there was nothing covering up that grayish glossy skin, with the curves of the breasts and abdomen completely exposed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And growing from the back‐was countless huge wings.</p>
<p class="null-p">An appearance precisely like an angel from the old myths. Everyone knows this, but it was the greatest illusory scene never seen beforehand.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it wasn't those factors that caused Shidou's eyes to be mesmerized. "Mi, o……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Stunned, he let out his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. The giant from the other side of the broken sky had the exact appearance as the Spirit of Origin •Takamiya Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if listening to Shidou's whisper, Tenka pursed her brow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐It's too pitiful to compare it to that woman. ‐It's not selfaware. Merely only information</p>
<p class="null-p">engraved on itself to imitate the appearance of Takamiya Mio."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Do you know what that is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Tenka threw the ice cream cone into her mouth while replying back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The embodiment of the Sephira Crystal's defensive instinct‐its</p>
<p class="null-p">'immunity' so to speak." "Immunity……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The power of Takamiya Mio's Sephira Crystal is too great. Even the body of her daughter Tohka was not fully compatible with it. Until now, I've been using reiryoku to tamper with that, but even that seems to have reached the limit." Despite this, Tenka continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, maintaining it this long was already impressive. ‐Give thanks to the Spirits later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing this, Shidou rounded his eyes. So, Tohka added a supplement to what was said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems Kotori, Origami, and the others have given us power to help make this world last a bit</p>
<p class="null-p">longer. Likely without everyone's help, it would have become this a lot faster."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so that's what they were doing…..!?" Suddenly, just at the moment Shidou said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">【‐】</p>
<p class="null-p">The enormous 'Mio' gave a cry as if singing. "! Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time he heard his name being called out by Tohka, his body was suddenly pulled to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, at the next moment, perhaps as the lips of 'Mio' squeezed shape to let out a sigh‐the elevated park that Shidou and the others were located at disappeared as the entire ground was hallowed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!? Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, who escaped into the sky under Tohka's arms, felt his voice chock at the terrible sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was neither crushed nor torn. A literal 'disappearance' where not even rubble or debris was left remaining. Just like using an eraser on the unsatisfied portions of a sketch, an unnatural blank space was born there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unnn! Un‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka landed on the ground that was barely left, she let out such a voice. She seemed to be</p>
<p class="null-p">asking, 'Are you okay Shidou!" but for some reason her voice sounded inexplicably unclear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking closely, he could see her mouth holding the ice cream cone just like a bird's beak. It appeared that she didn't want to throw away the ice cream in her hands so she hastily threw it into her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Tohka……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an excessively Tohka like act and demeanor even during this crisis. Shidou couldn't help but smile towards that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if responding to this, the huge "Mio' echoed a voice once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">【‐Non-conforming body. Avoiding attacks. Survival, conformation. Proceed, destroy. 】</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The tone of Mio's voice spun just like the cold words coming from an inorganic machine. From that extraordinary sense of unease, Shidou frowned involuntarily.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Mio that Shidou knew was already dead. He was forced to recognize that fact once again. Rather than resembling her more, it was better that the voice was completely different.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humph‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While huffing from her nose, Tenka danced in the air to evade the attack. She then let out a small sigh before landing besides Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's quite crude. It must view me as an intolerable 'pathogen' that needs to be expelled. Despite</p>
<p class="null-p">its master undoubtedly no longer being alive, it can still think to that level."</p>
<p class="null-p">She spewed those words out. However, from her gaze a feeling similar to pity could be felt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you going to do……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This should be known. This is a rejection system formed to eliminate the foreign object known as 'me'. It won't stop attacking until eliminating 'me'. If so, then there's nothing more than to defeat it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Tenka continued to speak while narrowing her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To defeat it is the equivalent of breaking the Sephira Crystal. A few minutes or a few hours later‐no matter the difference the end of this world will still be the same."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shuddered upon hearing what Tenka had said. That's right. The end of this world was also the equivalent for being the end of Tohka's life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps guessing his thoughts from Shidou's expression, Tenka added a supplement to what she said before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐From the moment this happens, destruction became inevitable. Either being killed by this</p>
<p class="null-p">now or killed after knocking that down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart was shaking despite his resolve to steel himself. Shidou gritted his teeth and clench his fist firmly to the point that his hand was bleeding.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at the next moment, a gentle voice could be heard speaking to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a while, Shidou. I'll finish this soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our date is still going on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Tohka‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing her say that, Shidou swiftly inhaled a single breath in.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, he swallowed the surging emotions‐choosing instead to smile back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Answers and the like, there was no need to think about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was only for a few minutes, as long as there was time to be spent with Tohka‐there was no other choice but for him to defeat this intrusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">As this idea was being transmitted back to Tohka, she nodded with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But can you really defeat that? It's too absurd……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked up to the huge 'Mio' and frowned. Then, Tohka shook her head once again. "‐Aah. If it is us, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said while nodding one more time as she took a step forward towards 'Mio'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if to match her, Tenka also stood next to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Sorry, Tenka. Please lend me your strength."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the need to apologize? I am you. ‐From the very beginning, I intended to do this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Tenka exchanged brief words and softly nodded to each other, embracing each other at close quarters.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the next moment, the silhouettes of the two fused into one‐releasing out a dazzling light.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the extraordinary light, Shidou reflexively shielded his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, when the light had finally settled down.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a single girl wearing a beautiful Astral Dress standing in their place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Toh, ka‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that figure, Shidou called out her name while stunned.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was well aware of his own somewhat dazed question, but he couldn't help himself anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl that appeared here was clearly Tohka, but her atmosphere was a bit different from Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her beautiful hair was tied up in a single ponytail; the Astral Dress covering her entire body was just like a princess in armor. On her back, there were beautiful wings reminiscent of Mio's Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">From her eyes, there was a slight difference in color.</p>
<p class="null-p">The right eye resembled Tohka, while the left eye felt like Tenka.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou stared, he finally figured out the true identity of the mysterious feeling given by this girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. The girl in front of his eyes‐Tohka and Tenka, it was the appearance of the two completely fused as one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Umu."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl nodded quietly. That reliable and gentle tone was undoubtedly Tohka's voice. "‐I'm heading out now, Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka left those words behind as she leaped into the sky to attack that giant.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was truly a mysterious feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Tenka, it should be a single existence returning back to its original state, but her body felt full of power like never before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost overflowing with reiryoku, her Astral Dress released dazzling radiance. Right now it felt possible to crush a star with a single finger. ……Of course, she didn't intend to do such a thing since Shidou would scold her for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This is natural of course. I have been using that reiryoku to maintain this world and suppress</p>
<p class="null-p">the 'immune function". Although it's not complete, we are at the same level of power as mother.) "Ooh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, suddenly hearing Tenka's voice echo in her head, Tohka yelled out in surprise. (What are you surprised about now? Wasn't I just absorbed into you just now?) "Muu…..no, but even so, I didn't expect to hear a voice in my head."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka slowly tightened her fist as the outline of her lips formed a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐um, how to describe it. This feels good. The feeling of fighting alongside with Tenka is being strongly conveyed. If possible, it would have been nice to be able to talk to each other earlier. Have you always been within me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">(Don't be unreasonable. After all, the only reason I can be with you is due to the act of forcibly taking in mother's power.)</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……I see. But……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka nodded as her smile grew thicker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Even if I can't hear your voice, Tenka has always been with me. At that time‐even at that</p>
<p class="null-p">time as well. Thank you so much." (…………Humph.)</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka finished speaking, Tenka breathed out as if a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Compared to this, concentrate on that. It's the system authority left in Takamiya Mio's Sephira Crystal. In other words, it has the same level of strength as us. Don't let your guard down.)</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu! I understand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka responded to Tenka's voice, she spread out her arms in the air. Then, she chanted, the name of the strongest Angel she had the most faith in. "‐'Sandalphon'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, the empty space trembled as a golden throne manifested from the light.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't all. Continuing on, Tohka yelled. "‐'Nahemah'!" She called out the name of the honorable Demon King.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately, in response to her voice, the darkness coiled together as a silver throne with a sword on top revealed itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. It was Tenka's Demon King, 'Nahemah'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, who had merged together with Tenka, could also exert this power now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka pressed her hands forward. Then following those movements, the huge swords on the two thrones were pulled forth and settled into Tohka's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">On her right hand 'Sandalphon'. On her left hand 'Nahemah'. With command over two incomparably powerful kings, Tohka screamed as she swung down with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ooooooooooooooooooooooooh‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A sword flash from both 'Sandalphon' and 'Nahemah' tore apart the air and bisected both arms of the huge 'Mio'.</p>
<p class="null-p">【‐Damage. Both arms. Target. Survival. Exclusion. Exterm‐】</p>
<p class="null-p">Particles of reiryoku fluttered and sparkled from the cross section of the huge 'Mio's' arms, as it stirred its body in agony. However, Tohka's attack didn't end here. She swung a slash from both swords again, both light and darkness engraved a cross-shape into 'Mio's' chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐just at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">【‐】</p>
<p class="null-p">The huge 'Mio' let out a consciously loud howl, bending her head backwards, as a new face grew from the space above her breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">(Tch‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">Such an act was truly beyond all expectations. Tohka widened her eyes as she heard the sound of Tenka clicking her tongue in her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, 'Mio's' fresh face squirmed her lips to release a sigh. ‐Yes, it was the same movements she made when annihilating the elevated park in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She focused her concentration as she filled her body brimming with reiryoku. The next moment‐an invisible shockwave struck Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Tohka‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, who was looking at the battle between 'Mio' and Tohka on the ground, screamed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Tohka cut off both of 'Mio's' arms, a new face grew from her chest and fired an attack aimed at Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ground behind Tohka was wordlessly erased in a split second. Although Tohka managed to consolidate her defenses to avoid being eliminated, that didn't completely offset the power of that sigh. She was shot down from the sky and collided at the place where the ground used to be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku, ah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka used her sword as a cane in order to stand up. With cracks emerging everywhere on her Astral Dress, it seemed she was reaching her limit even being able to stand up with her two feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">【‐Arms. Regeneration. Target. Conformation.】</p>
<p class="null-p">However, 'Mio's' attacks didn't stop there. 'Mio' grew two new arms at the stump of her old torn ones, stretching it out towards Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Make it in time……! 'Raphael'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou focused his consciousness to exert the power of the Angel sealed within his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">With wind covering his body, he soared into the air. Flying at a high speed, Shidou called out the name of the next Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Metatron'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, countless 'feathers' appeared around Shidou, emitting rays of light towards 'Mio' all at once. But‐ "Wha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The light beams emitted from 'Metatron' only thinly pricked 'Mio's' skin. Moreover, the wounds inflicted were regenerated in mere seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">But was also reasonably expected as well. Even though this huge 'Mio' was like a system without a will, it was still a part of Mio's Sephira Crystal. ‐Only those with the same power as Mio could harm Mio. This was a fact he painfully experienced in the previous battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku‐how can I……give up! And my date with Tohka isn't over yet……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He summoned one Angel after another, releasing repeated attacks in an effort to stop 'Mio'. However, 'Mio' kept attacking Tohka, remaining in state oblivious of Shidou's existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Staggering, Tohka was using all of her might just to avoid this attack. "Mio……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou knew that 'this' was not Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐it became unbearable to hold back his screams any longer. Mio, the one who had sacrificed her life to save everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one thing he never wanted to see again was her face being used to attack Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mioooooooo‐!" ‐Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened at the same time Shidou was screaming.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou had just heard such a voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou unintentionally stopped his hand, as he looked at the huge 'Mio's' face.</p>
<p class="null-p">That face still showed no expression. It was just mercilessly trying to eliminate Tohka's existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he noticed. Rather than hearing that voice directly in his ear, it was heard directly in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just now, was……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou opened his eyes, he placed his hand against his forehead. A hallucination caused by the extreme condition. No.</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice of 'Mio' uttered to mislead Shidou?</p>
<p class="null-p">No.</p>
<p class="null-p">Definitely just now‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐You have power. Help Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With conviction, Shidou raised his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The huge 'Mio' raised its freshly grown arm to challenge Tohka. A ray of intense reiryoku was</p>
<p class="null-p">emitted from each fingertip, changing the surrounding scenery in an instant. (Tohka!)</p>
<p class="null-p">"U, mu……I'm fine. I can somehow avoid it."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Tohka managed to move her aching body, she responded to voice inside her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But this is turning into a one-sided defensive battle. There must be a clue caught in its behavior to begin the counterattack‐</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, as if to stop those words, the rays of light began to dance chaotically.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. 'Mio's' hand began firing many rays of light. Starting from its palm, as mentioned earlier, 'Mio's' small face began to expand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Careless. Tohka's face stiffened as she frowned. 'Mio's' rays of light were only a decoy.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was all for the sake of releasing the strongest "sigh" at the timing where Tohka could not avoid‐</p>
<p class="null-p">But. The expected impact didn't come for some time. The moment that 'Mio' was trying to release that "sigh". "‐Ain Soph Aur'!" As she wondered where such a cry resonated from, a huge flower appeared above 'Mio's' head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The huge flower with the statue of a girl at the center of its petals shed down light into the sky‐silencing both arms as 'Mio's' face that was about to release the "sigh" at Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was neither crushed nor torn. It was as if all life was lost from the part where the light touched</p>
<p class="null-p">as 'Mio's' arms fell to the ground. Seeing that sight, Tohka involuntarily widened her eyes. "Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">(It's that idiot.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka's voice echoed in her head as if to match Tohka's astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't unreasonable either. After all, it was one of</p>
<p class="null-p">Takamiya Mio's Angels‐the Angel of death that would plunder away all life, 'Ain Soph Aur'.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tohka's surprise was not only for the appearance of 'Ain Soph Aur'. The voice that had called out the name of that angel was unmistakably‐ "Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Aah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka called out his name, Shidou rose above the ground as he strongly nodded back. Yes. It was unbelievable that it was Shidou who had caused Mio's Angel to manifest. "Let's go Tohka. ‐Let's</p>
<p class="null-p">finish this early and continue the date."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou smiled as he spoke. Tohka widened her eyes in surprise for a moment‐ "……Umu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, she returned the smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Mio' stirred in agony, moving to cut off its own right arm as a matter of course. The next moment, a new arm was grown again from the cut surface. It began to shake once again to fire off beams of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Hmm, as one might expect it is certainly tenacious. ‐Can you keep going?)</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, of course!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Responding to Tenka's voice, with 'Sandalphon' on her right hand and 'Nahemah' with her left hand, she swung down and sliced off "Mio's' finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, Tohka weaved and danced in the sky, approaching closer to 'Mio's' body. "‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Detecting Tohka's approach, from its original head, the pit of 'Mio's' stomach grew as she tried to release the 'sigh' from its face.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Ain Soph'."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou's voice echoed again from somewhere. A huge tree bearing a statue of a girl appeared behind "Mio's' back‐from there as the starting point, a monochrome space began to spread out.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Angel of laws, 'Ain Soph'. If tracing the origin, it was no exaggeration to say that this world was formed by the power of this Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Captured by the power of its roots, 'Mio's' movements came to a complete stop. "‐Haaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not like Tohka to miss that chance. With both 'Sandalphon' and 'Nahemah' swung, Tohka vertically bisected 'Mio's' body.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even then 'Mio' would not fall. Even when bounded by 'Ain Soph', the sliced left</p>
<p class="null-p">and right halves extend out a tentacle like protrusion as if trying to recombine once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……this is endless!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka unintentionally furrowed her brow. Then, as if responding to that, Shidou raised his voice. "There must be something like a core that makes up that 'Mio'! I have to break it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">(That's surprisingly accurate. But how does he intend to do that?)</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Please leave it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou smiled as if he could hear Tenka's voice echo in Tohka's head. Then, he kicked off against the ground, dancing through the sky and reaching above 'Mio's' head.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, he shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">The name of that Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Ain'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if considering the pure white light released from Shidou's hand,</p>
<p class="null-p">'Mio' screamed a tremendous cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">That should be it. What Shidou revealed was the last angel possessed by Mio‐the moment it was activated, the Angel of the void 'Ain' returned everything to nothingness.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds later, the light gradually faded away.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no longer the appearance of a huge "Mio' there.</p>
<p class="null-p">No‐to be precise, the entire huge exterior was erased. Only the human sized core of 'Mio' remained, covered in 'Ain Soph' as if playing around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now! Tohka! Tenka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou screamed to urge the two. In response to that, Tenka smirked a little in Tohka's mind. (Ha! Are you done already? And here I was starting to get a better opinion of you, human.) Upon hearing that, Tohka smiled once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying, Tenka. It's not necessary to get a better opinion of Shidou‐he's the best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka spoke loudly while raising 'Sandalphon' and 'Nahemah' into the sky so they would overlap.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment as if to match that motion, the two thrones floating behind Tohka broke into pieces and attached themselves to the two swords Tohka had raised.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before long, inside the violent torrent, a huge single swinging sword revealed its appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Sandalphon's 'Halvanhelev'. As well as 'Nahemah's 'Paverschlev'.</p>
<p class="null-p">By bringing the two together, Tohka carried the greatest and strongest Angel and Demon King.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐'Yezelhlev'‐" (Kanji reads as Sword of Genesis)</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tohka lifted the sword with every ounce of power from her body, she looked quietly at 'Mio's' core.</p>
<p class="null-p">While carrying the same appearance as Mio, the core was now the size of a human being, but that thing was no longer Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that nostalgic figure, Tohka recalled a certain memory in her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">After acquiring Mio's Sephira Crystal into her body, Mio's memories had been entrusted to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the memory of when Mio accidently produced Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">While being cautious of her status as an unexpected irregular, she did not break the Sephira Crystal. It could be described as a single exception besides herself and she couldn't bear to kill another pure Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">It may have been pity or it may have been the kindness of a mother. It can be said that regardless</p>
<p class="null-p">of which whim, Mio's choice lead to Tohka's life and brought about this moment right now. "Mio‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's head recalled another memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the world of memories created by 'Ain Soph'. Mio and Reine, Shinji and Shidou, all of them existed in the memories of that dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was Shidou's words that brought an end to that happy world that seemed to last forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Mio, you created me to create an existence that could kill you.) Tohka didn't know if Shidou's words were correct.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if that was really her hidden wish that Mio herself didn't even noticed‐</p>
<p class="null-p">There might have been one more reason to not kill Tohka's unexpected existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Sorry. It's because of my selfishness; I've kept you waiting for such a long time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka quietly whispered‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooohhh‐!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Swinging down with the huge sword, the surrounding space and</p>
<p class="null-p">'Mio's' core were bisected in half.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Final Chapter: Last Day Alive</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end of the world, the sparkling grains of light rained down like snow bathed in moonlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until a few seconds ago, 'Mio' and the remnants of the reiryoku that formed the huge sword spread a veil of color over the cracked sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no escaping this ruin. The end drew near. Shidou's eyesight was momentarily snatched away by the view. The scenery was a little bit too beautiful to decorate the end of the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">In such a painting-like landscape, with her Astral Dress flickering and glimmering, Tohka slowly descended down.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the Northern Lights serving as a backdrop from her figure, it was just like a Goddess sitting in heaven‐or an angel who had come to rescue dead human souls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">Half-stunned, he called out her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka slightly raised her chin in response to those words‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, with high pressure, she huffed from her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">He finally noticed it in that reaction. Tohka's mood was a little bit different than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tenka……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I've borrowed this body for a while. Too bad for you that it is not Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that isn't……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Shidou was about to speak, Tenka continued to interrupted him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As you can see, this is the limit. This world is over and you are released. Rejoice, that is what you wanted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Released……but Tenka rewrote the world……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The power to overwrite the world with the neighboring world is no longer left in that woman's</p>
<p class="null-p">Sephira Crystal. ‐Seems like 'Rasiel' was the chief reason for stirring up your uneasiness."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Tenka slightly shrugged her shoulders. Listening to that, Shidou said, "That Kurumi……" as sweat dripped down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he immediately reconsidered this. Certainly, the omniscient 'Rasiel' made it possible</p>
<p class="null-p">to understand this world. But at the same time, he knew that meant Mio's Sephira Crystal and Tohka's existence would soon disappear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right. Shidou understood. For this reason, Kurumi urged and sent Shidou to go on a last date with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, at that moment, Shidou was able to understand the meaning behind Kurumi's words. He recalled he was recommended to use 'Zafkiel' rather than 'Rasiel'. 'Zafkiel's method wouldn't have uncovered any lies, but allowed one to personally re-experience one's own memories‐more than that, the reason was that she didn't want to inform him of Tohka's time limit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">For being called the "Worst Spirit", she was remarkably kind. Shidou breathed out as he shook his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">No, there was one more person who shouldn't be forgotten as very kind. He looked that way to Tenka's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Playing the role of a villain, the Spirit that led to Shidou and Tohka's date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that look?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">If such a thing is said, Tenka would become grumpy again. Shidou judged it to be that manner as he put a stop to his strained smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Tenka raised her eyebrow in suspicion, she kept talking as if saying, "Well, fine".</p>
<p class="null-p">"I used that woman's power to no more just make a boundary. ‐A world where time advances differently than the real world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The progression of time is different……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Takamiya Mio's Sephira Crystal was already collapsing. It would have been able to keep its presence for a few more minutes at most. So I manipulated the speed of time within this boundary to extend time for as long as possible. The month you spent in this world is only about three minutes in the real world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐I, see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to what Tenka had said, Shidou took in a long deep breath to reflect his understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that Mio's Sephira Crystal will collapse in a few minutes…….essentially meant the end of Tohka's life.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why Tenka snatched away Mio's Sephira Crystal and created this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">All for Tohka, in order to have these last moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, really‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..You really are kind."</p>
<p class="null-p">This time he could stand it any longer. Those words spilled out from his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tenka didn't look grumpy as Shidou had expected. While huffing from her nose a little, she slightly looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, if you shut up, you'll be released. You should spend the rest of this time with Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka……but what are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's obvious. I will return to Tohka again. I'm not going to get in the way anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That can't be. Even though we were here together‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou spoke, Tenka shook her head as if to refute those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Today, I completely disregarded my own words and tagged along. At the very end, let me go through my role. In such a world, I am a being equivalent to a God of creation. Any less respect and divine punishment will need to be delivered."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, such a thing being said in these circumstances necessitated a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to those words, Shidou began to hold back his voice……deeply bowing his head in assent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Oh, yes. Thank you, my Goddess."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said in a jokingly pace, Tenka turned her eyes downward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just know. ‐But before the world is completely over; you can only seal the remnants of the Spirit of Origin's reiryoku. There's no denying the possibility of creating some sort of aftermath upon the verge of annihilation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……All right. But wasn't it Tenka who absorbed Mio's Sephira</p>
<p class="null-p">Crystal? Rather than Tohka, shouldn't I have to seal your power?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, problem. Tohka and I are intricately linked. In fact, Tohka would have used that woman's power to incarnate me. If you kiss Tohka, that's all you need."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, sealing is more than just kissing, if the other person doesn't open her heart to me‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐That's why I said there's no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Tenka said in a strong tone, Shidou involuntarily widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spending time with you, Tohka's heart was sparkling. It was enjoyable, pleasant, and truly a</p>
<p class="null-p">blessing. ‐I like that feeling in Tohka's heart." And so, Tenka continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was the one who created this world for Tohka's sake…… but a little, just only a little, once</p>
<p class="null-p">before the very end, it wasn't as if I wanted to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tenka‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If. If I. If I was able to meet you earlier too‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka said that as she shook her head just a little. It was boorish to say any more than that. Instead, Tenka broke away from her usual sour look and smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Good-bye Shidou, the date with you wasn't bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while saying so, Tenka's posture fell apart as if losing consciousness. "! Tenka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou hurried to support Tenka. Then, as if to match that rhythm, her body faintly glowed as the Astral Dress she wore disappeared into particles of light. What left behind were the faintly colored clothes Tohka had worn beforehand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Nh, ……Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Tenka said in a small voice as she raised her head. No, with the tone of that voice, Shidou had noticed. ‐Right now, she had become Tohka instead of Tenka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, are you tired, Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……Umu. The talk with Tenka seems to be over."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou called out to her, Tohka spoke as if she had sensed everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Undoubtedly, she must have reached that conclusion during the gap felt while Shidou was taking</p>
<p class="null-p">to Tenka. Shidou confessed out an "ah" in assent. "I see……then." Tohka smiled after looking up at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Let's continue this date."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, under the crumbling sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two spoke to each other side by side. At first they walked without a destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">After walking for a while, they sat down on a miraculously remaining bench.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking back to each encounter until now‐repeating stories of whatever came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐But I was really shocked eating kinako bread for the first time. I didn't even imagine that there was something so delicious like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, I'm glad you like it so much. We happened to be in front of the bakery by accident."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu. I thought at that time. This guy who is making me eat something so delicious isn't a bad person……so without that, it may not have been possible to seal the reiryoku."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I was saved by kinako bread!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, just kidding. Thinking back to it now‐it must have felt so delicious because Shidou let me eat it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, that's right. Because it was with Shidou and everyone that it was so much fun. The time I went to the aquarium, the time I played at Ocean Park……even the time Shidou became a woman who was not Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Opps, did you add something extra at the end just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying? Isn't that a good memory? The band at the</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenguu festival was so much fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, well, that was a good memory in of itself……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you think about it now, if you had learned how to become a woman who is not Shidou earlier, it might not have been necessary to flee when Shidou entered the hot springs during the school trip."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I can't do anything about my body!? Rather that was the worst pinch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true. So what you needed was 'Haniel'. If you had sealed Natsumi's powers sooner, you could have entered the woman's bath!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you stop inviting a misunderstanding with that notion!? It's not like I was trying to enter the woman's bath in the first place!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. Sorry, sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really……If I remember correctly, Natsumi's power was certainly troublesome. You know there was that time when Natsumi transformed into someone else among everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, that happened too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"At that time, I was honestly a little suspicious when Tohka was eating so little. I wondered if you were Natsumi transformed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. It was a misunderstanding after all, but I was really surprised at that time. ‐Ah, that's</p>
<p class="null-p">right. Speaking of Natsumi, there's one thing I have to apologize to</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you have to apologize? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, do you remember the word, Natsumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu! Of course! Isn't it a greeting that means I love you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. That's it, but I actually thought that up on the spot‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my favorite word. Even when I had a hard time, I felt it would get better when I said the words that Shidou taught me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what does Natsumi mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Well actually, it's a word with an even stronger meaning than 'I love you so much'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, is that right! ……Fufu, I see. Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumiiiiiiii!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! I'm all better!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm fine now. That'll fix me up whenever that happens!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But yes, how nostalgic. Ah‐there was the time when everyone drew dōjinshi together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was that. That deadline was really tough……but it was thanks to Tohka and everyone for selling so much. That bunny girl outfit looked really cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nm……it isn't like Shidou to give up suddenly. If you say that, the Shidou who came to help</p>
<p class="null-p">when we were trapped in that fairy tale world was really cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because it was me but also not me……it was an ideal image of me made by everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. I always think Shidou also looks cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Haha……I see. It's embarrassing to be praised so suddenly. But that doesn't feel right since I was piglet in that fairy tale……Tohka was</p>
<p class="null-p">Momotaro. Anyway, I think that look suited you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I felt that it was easier to move around. Everyone was in various different outfits……fufu, it was tough at that time, but looking back I felt I enjoyed it a little due to how strange it was."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……certainty that might be it." ‐Etc.</p>
<p class="null-p">While looking at the world that was gradually breaking apart, we exchanged stories that didn't fit this catastrophe. But that was good. That was‐good.</p>
<p class="null-p">This casual time was such a blessing that he really couldn't believe it‐ That's why he couldn't believe it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who was talking with a smile now would soon disappear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">During this pleasant conversation, with that thought lingering in his mind, Shidou felt a small breath clog his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was hopeless. It was hopeless. He desperately endured the tears that were about to overflow. It should be harsher for Tohka than anyone else. However, Tohka continued to cheerfully talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, in order for her to greet him one last time with a smile. Surely, in order to not leave behind any regrets to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, he couldn't afford to cry. Shidou somehow kept talking and smiling as his fingertips were faintly trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Aah, that's right‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka muttered while exhaling a deep breath out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un……what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was thinking that it was time to say hello to everyone. I haven't been able to convey my gratitude even though I've made this world for so long."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……yes. But it can't be helped. Surely everyone‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Shidou! Tohka! Are you safe!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the moment Shidou was talking, such a voice echoed from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking that direction in astonishment, they realized that Kotori and the other Spirits were already beginning to approach them unnoticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haha."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou and Tohka saw their faces, they both began to laugh unbearably.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what happened to the both of you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guess. It's because it's been a long time since seeing Kaguya's punchable face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to hear that from someone with the same face as me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, such verbal exchanges were made. While Shidou tried to calm down his breathing, he spread out his palms as if to apologize.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because the timing was too good……I was wondering if some sort of God had blessed me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori made a face as if not understanding what she was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in response to that, Tohka slowly got up from the bench and turned to face everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying that it's just good. ‐Everyone came here. It's good to look at everyone's face at the very end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Tohka, the Spirits turned breathless.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that fact may have already been transmitted by either Kurumi or Nia. Even though there was some biting their lips, no one looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka gently opened her lips while staring affectionately back at everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori, Yoshino, Yoshinon, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku, Natsumi, Nia, Mukuro, Kurumi, and‐Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you so much everyone. Although I was rude when we first met, I really felt lucky to be able to meet everyone. The days I spent with everyone sparkled like a treasure. Whether it is now or another time‐I was very glad and had fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana and Kannazuki, all of the crew members, Ai, Mai, and Mii, Tama-chan sensei, Tonomachi, everyone in class, please tell them this for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, really……thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to everyone‐I was happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh, ugh‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka-zan……"</p>
<p class="null-p">At Tohka's words, the Spirits lowered their faces as tears started to fall. Tohka, who smiled as if she was a little troubled, turned towards Shidou. "…... Shidou‐it's about time. Before the world collapses …..please." And, as if prepared, she said so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou took a deep breath, and after breathing out, he replied back. He stepped in front of Tohka, placing his hand on her shoulder. Immediately Tohka was looking at Shidou's eyes‐slowly, closing her eyes. Certainly, like she was waiting for a kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of the sort when coupled with her beauty, her body looked just like a carved sculpture.</p>
<p class="null-p">While minimizing the tremors shaking his hand, he closed his eyes as well and brought his lips close to Tohka's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a voice was heard coming from among the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Tohka suddenly open their eyes, turning to the owner of that voice. Over there‐it was a little girl with a rabbit puppet on</p>
<p class="null-p">her left hand. "Yoshino……? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka looked at the girl in surprise‐staring at Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Just at the moment Shidou was about to kiss Tohka, Yoshino raised her voice to stop it. No‐not only that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is it okay? Tohka-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino, with tears pouring down, squeezed out her voice from her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">From such a scolding expression coming from Yoshino, Tohka was left momentarily breathless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshino……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it really okay……! These last words are……so……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino yelled out, matching her eyes that were wet with tears to Yoshinon who was on her left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yoshinon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Un. Good luck, Yoshino."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yoshino exchanged such words with "Yoshinon", she took a deep breath‐ As it was, she pulled out "Yoshinon" from her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At such a scene, the Spirits all raised a startled voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Yoshinon is Yoshino's most important friend. So much so that they were always together and being separated was enough to make her mental state unstable. No one ever imagined Yoshino removing Yoshinon by herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Natsumi-san. Please hold onto this for a little while."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!? Y-yes……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino handed over "Yoshinon" to Natsumi, who then let out a voice as if she had turned inside out. Rather than from the politeness, it was as if she was overwhelmed by Yoshino's mysterious intensity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino then took one step ahead and continued to make her declaration to everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone. I will use the victory privilege right now. Do you mind?" "…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits all fell silent at Yoshino's words. Only Shidou made a face as if not understanding what Yoshino was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Yoshino raised her face as if having decided on her feelings, gazing at Shidou‐as she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Shidou-san. I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the sudden confession, both Tohka and Shidou raised voices of surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. They didn't even imagine that there would be someone who would confess their love at such a timing where the world was about to come to a close. Moreover, that it would come from someone as docile as Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the other Spirits just quietly watched on, as if they had already decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino kept crying as her nose began to redden, but she still kept continuing in a feverish tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since the time you saved me, I've always loved you……! This feeling won't lose to anyone else……! Not even to Kotori-san! Not even to Origami-san! And‐not even to Tohka-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka was astonished by Yoshino's sudden confession, but then she spontaneously felt herself tightening the amount of strength placed into her fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what are you suddenly saying Yoshino!? If you say that, I also to Shidou‐" Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka felt something trickling down her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the time she realized it was her own tears, it was already‐ Something within herself had broken down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ah, aaah, aaaaaaaaaaah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The waves of emotions she held back up until now began to leak out through the starting point of a small hole.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order for Shidou to not be sad, for everyone to not regret, she endured everything that began to overflow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……I also……I also love Shidou……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widened his eyes in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it couldn't be stopped anymore. She couldn't stop it. Tohka grabbed onto Shidou's shoulders, she let out the words of volatile passion to its destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou……Shidou! I love Shidou! This 'love" is different form the "love" to everyone else! Who would want to lose……! I want to be with Shidou more! I want to spend more time with Shidou! No……I don't want to disappear……! I don't want to be apart from</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, while shedding huge beads of tears, complained and clung onto Shidou. Tohka, who had ruled herself out so much until just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not wanting to make everyone sad, Tohka who kept herself strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh, ah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked at that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something within Shidou was cut apart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Aaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah‐!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, who had also been feigning to be as calm as possible to sympathize with Tohka's feelings, had tried to be cheerful.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want to leave behind any sadness.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to at least part ways with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to spend these last moments happily together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐What……is this……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment Shidou squeezed out his voice, breaking down while tightly, tightly hugging Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also…..I also like Tohka! I like you so much I don't know what to do…...! I don't want to be</p>
<p class="null-p">separated from you…...! I want to be with you more!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, he cried out with a voice enough to make his throat feel crushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did I endure? To spend the remaining time meaningfully? To not make Tohka sad? Right now, all of that consideration seemed impertinent. Who cares about that. Screw all of that. What he hated was his farsightedness. What he hated was the moderateness he attached to himself. This was the last time he could speak with Tohka. This was the last time he could convey his feelings to Tohka‐!</p>
<p class="null-p">As if tempted by the lamentation from those two, the world made a noticeably powerful despicable act.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky collapsed, the earth splintered, the surrounding scenery disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Tohka called out for each other's name‐ Sharing a final kiss in the fading world.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world cleared up.</p>
<p class="null-p">The original world had been restored.</p>
<p class="null-p">Opening his eyes, Shidou and the others saw that the Tenguu City Park had disappeared from the face of the earth, replaced by the sound of waves reaching the shore.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the place at "that time", after the battle with the Spirit of</p>
<p class="null-p">Origin‐the place where Mio's</p>
<p class="null-p">Sephira Crystal had disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to "that time" the scene did not change.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone's appearance,</p>
<p class="null-p">The surrounding scenery as well,</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the wreckage scattered around was exactly the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's just that, in Shidou's arms, Tohka's figure‐was gone.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">Long time no see. This is Tachibana Kōshi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Date A Live Volume 20 Tohka World" has been successfully delivered to everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time I intended to present all that I can write now. I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, it has reached 20 volumes. As the winner of the 20th Fantasia Feature Novel Award, I am deeply moved. Incidentally, this novel will be released on March 20th, so there's another 20 there. Huh. It somehow feels the same as how '3' has been used with Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">So this is Tohka World. There any many things I want to talk about, but this time I wish to refrain from spoiling as much as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the Afterword has limited space, I would rather talk about it in a place with lengthier page width rather than half-talk it here.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, just one thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was very nice to be able to write this role for Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time this was sold together with "Date A Bullet Volume 5" written by Higashide Yuichiro- sensei!</p>
<p class="null-p">The Seventh Region that was difficult to reach was actually an institutional casino space! What is the best way for Kurumi and Hibiki to earn money? The story is also moving towards a shocking development……! It would be great if you can enjoy both together!</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, this book was able to be published thanks to the efforts of these people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Illustrator-san, as always thanks for such wonderful illustrations. Of course isn't the combination of Tohka on the frontispiece, Kurumi with Rasiel, and Yoshino's Siryon all too perfect?</p>
<p class="null-p">Editor-san, I apologize for dragging along the manuscript each time. Designer Tsunako-san, the cover design is also super cool.</p>
<p class="null-p">I would also like to express my sincerest gratitude to everyone involved in editing, sales, distribution, etc, and above all, you for holding this book at this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, the story of "Date A Live", which has accompanied everyone for many years, is slowly coming to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">I dare say the next volume is where the main story of Date A Live reaches its conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hope you'll follow the story of Shidou and everyone to the very end.</p>
<p class="null-p">February 2019</p>
<p class="null-h2">Tachibana Koushi.</p>
