<p class="null-h1">Chapter 6: Hoshimiya Mukuro</p>
<p class="null-p">Not long ago, Nushi-sama had cut this hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well strictly speaking, giving the finishing touches may be more precise to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each time the scissors controlled by Nushi-sama made a light noise; the strands of hair gently fell by my feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was such a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">A haircut hasn't been done for years.</p>
<p class="null-p">Muku's history was engraved in the layers of this hair. The fun times, the painful times, a lot of things are in this hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, just cutting this hair doesn't mean throwing it all away……until a while ago, this wasn't something considered even joking about. But there was reliance on this hair, obsession over this hair, an overt fear of losing this hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that is why it was decided to let none other than Nushi-sama to cut this hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's no big deal. Certainly it was felt that nothing will be lost even after cutting this hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what, this family would welcome Muku.</p>
<p class="null-p">There are friends who laughed and mourned together.</p>
<p class="null-p">By having them, Muku surely has a fresh start.</p>
<p class="null-p">The power was gained to walk forward without clinging onto this hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the haircut over, Muku stood in front of the mirror.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nushi-sama praised Muku as the best beauty in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mufu, clearly flattery, but it doesn't feel bad to accept.</p>
<p class="null-p">But then, at that time, Muku suddenly thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">For only a moment, a feeling was embraced that should have been blown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The new appearance that Nushi-sama praised, yearning for Ane-sama to catch a glance of it as well.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Walls are not always necessary to stop a person's feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chains are not always necessarily required to tie up a person's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">--In fact, this girl, by just being there, stitched their feet to a halt and restrained their bodies in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--A, aa--aaaaaaaaaa--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like the distant thunder.</p>
<p class="null-p">A loud howl caused the surrounding air to tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then as if to match that rhythm, her hair--faintly colored hair that had long since lost its hue, swayed ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was as if she was denoting her own existence. Comparatively, she was like a dead tree. The dry faded branches softly rustled and quivered, lightly stirring the remaining leaves.</p>
<p class="null-p">Peeking into those eyes, there wasn't anything resembling vitality that could be felt. What reflected in those glassy eyes wasn't joy, pleasure, hostility, or killing intent, but only an empty hue.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ten swords surrounding her back exerted a strange pressure, but given the circumstances they were far from being ornamental. Rather, this pitiful beast looked in pain from forcibly trying to stand up from rugged constraints.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Codename <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">A Spirit that shouldn't exist in a world where Spirits are extinct.</p>
<p class="null-p">A temporary name attached to her without a name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">From everywhere, voices full of confusion were heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't unreasonable.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, she suddenly appeared in a briefing room located within <Fraxinus>, an airship located 15,000 meters above the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">The aerial warship, the robust mechanical castle guarded by a solid exterior and invisible camouflage. The champion of the sky sat on the throne of supremacy. It was an absolute space beyond reach and impossible to be invaded by anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this girl easily walked into this sanctuary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Piercing the exterior would mean breaking through the Voluntary Territory stretched outward. But in a method far from common sense, she passed through a hole opened in the void.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the briefing room with Shidou, the former Spirit girls, and the <Fraxinus>AI Maria, there were 12 figures in total. Until now, they had assembled a meeting to discuss about this Spirit, <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their expressions uniformly stiffened as all gazes poured onto <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, right before their eyes, a predator with absolute power had emerged. Instinctual horror, it wasn't unreasonable for the body to be rendered feeble when stared down like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, my bad. For you to have to come and pick me up like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">In this joking manner, Shidou spoke as he stepped forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……Shidou--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Ssh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone raised a voice of concern for Shidou's actions, but it was immediately held back by another high-pitched voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">From a glance, it became recognizable that it came from a girl wearing a deep crimson military uniform and had her hair tied in twintails with black and white ribbons.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Itsuka Kotori. She was Shidou's little sister and the captain of this</p>
<p class="null-p"><Fraxinus>. Her expression showed a clear level of trust towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">He expressed her gratitude to his little sister for understanding his intentions. Slowly reducing the distance, he looked straight into <Beast>'s empty eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be a lie to say <Beast>wasn't terrifying. Anyway, the person in front of his eyes could decapitate his head in the blink of an eye. Moreover, Shidou currently lacks the divine protection of the Spirits. Even if that wasn't her intention, there was a good chance his life will be playfully plundered.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shidou didn't stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">He 100% knew that her power was horrifying. But Shidou above all else-- he wanted to talk to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who is she?</p>
<p class="null-p">What is her goal?</p>
<p class="null-p">While having so much power--why was she screaming so sorrowfully?</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to know why.</p>
<p class="null-p">And if there was something he could do, he wanted to reach out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless if he has the power of the Spirits or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just--he wanted to save her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so, please understand. Having your current swords out would be</p>
<p class="null-p">--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Y, ou……are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to block out Shidou's words, <Beast>let out a roar."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Faint--it was a voice so small that it was possible to miss it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was unmistakable proof in this girl's breathing that her ego was still there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Who are you? ……Why am……I here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt more like a self-question than one directed towards Shidou. Confusion, as if she was hesitating over the meaning behind her own actions. As this girl was clad in a sword-like atmosphere, such a faint feeling of that could be felt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, chasing after your lingering scent……? Why……? I'm……you</p>
<p class="null-p">are……what……I'm--I am……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Did you really come to see me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A,a,a,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>raised her roar to a scream, swinging her right hand at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Five blades were floating around her hand as if accompanying each finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such was the beast's claw. Unable to react this this sudden attack in time, Shidou could only accept this slash--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Nushi-sama!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, at that moment, Shidou was pulled by the hem of his clothes and fell backwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost at the same time, the five streaks of the slash tore through the void, deeply cutting into the walls of the briefing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of an explosion roared. The inner walls of the ship, which was packed with various precise instruments, were all destroyed. Flames and smoke blew out. That shockwave received caused the entire ship to start shaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to this tremor, the girls all lost their balance and fell on their backsides.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at the same time, the movements stopped by <Beast>'s sudden presence began to stir again. Everyone kept ducking down while keeping their distance from <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that pause, with sweat oozing from his back, Shidou turned to the girl who had pulled on his clothes. "Y-You saved me, Mukuro."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……to close for comfort."</p>
<p class="null-p">The petite girl with her hair tied in a bun said while breathing out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hoshimiya Mukuro. She was also among one of the former Spirit girls. If she hadn't predicted <Beast>'s movements earlier, Shidou's entire upper body would have been shredded into pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this was no time to be eager in surviving. Smoke rose from the inner walls of the ship damaged by <Beast>'s blow. A loud emergency alarm was echoing from the speakers. And most importantly, <Beast>was still onboard. This was undoubtedly a crisis situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in the midst of all of this, a clear voice echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Explosion confirmed inside the ship. Firefighting procedures commenced at once. The crew should evacuate immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that said, under the master's voice, a hand was exaggeratingly raised. In line with that, robotic arms extended all over the room and started spraying fire extinguisher on the burning walls.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if she was manipulating the ship's equipment at will. But that was no surprise. Her name was Maria. <Fraxinus>'s AI, who was using a human interface body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maria, what is the damage situation!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori raised her voice while lowering her body to avoid inhaling the smoke. Then, Maria returned to kneeling down like everyone else. Of course, her body had no issue with breathing in smoke, but she seemed committed to following through with this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Minor--it's hard to say, there is no issues with navigation. Just--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Just?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope she can keep quiet."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Maria said that in a light tone, an explosion resounded again from the top of the smoke covered room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Aaaaaaaaaaa--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A roar pierced through everyone's ears in the briefing room. It seemed <Beast>was swinging her claws in a devastating manner, trying to blow away both the black smoke from the fumes and the white smoke released by the fire extinguisher.</p>
<p class="null-p">From behind the dense smoke, the screeching sound of metal being destroyed was intermitted with the sound of explosions. Each time, <Fraxinus>'s huge hull greatly shook.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kiyaaaaaaaah!? Are we going to crash!? Do something Mariamon!? Isn't this your body!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A woman with glasses was crouching on the floor, screaming with tears in her eyes. --Honjou Nia, she was also one of the former Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that pitiful mess, Maria lowered her gaze on Nia without any mercy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're too noisy, Nia. Please try to act your age a little."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what you're going to say?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Nia's scream, <Beast>swung her claw again. A slash passed just above Nia's head. Nia's face turned blue as she silenced her mouth with both of her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">But things hadn't improved in the slightest. <Beast>still roared intermittently while continuing to destroy the ship. In this manner, even a ship with a hull supported by the voluntary territory would inevitably crash.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou grimaced at the idea that flew into his mind. <Fraxinus>crashing,</p>
<p class="null-p">that would mean the death of all members on the ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not to mention the crew, the former Spirit girls who had lost their Reiryoku would be no exception. If <Beast>wasn't moved away from this place as soon as possible, certain death was awaiting them all.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that wasn't the only problem. She had a sword that could open a 'hole' in space. It would be pointless to throw <Beast>out of the ship if she could easily return.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, <Beast>'s several attacks had destroyed part of the floor of the briefing room. From the huge hole that opened, outside--underneath the night sky was visible in front of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Fraxinus>is an aerial ship coated with the voluntary territory. Thanks to that they haven't been thrown out by the pressure difference. But if this destruction continued, it was only a matter of time before Shidou and the others would be thrown out of the ship. He had to do it as soon as possible</p>
<p class="null-p">-- "----"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Shidou took in a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. An idea had come to his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mukuro."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hesitating for a moment, Shidou called out to the girl at the nearest proximity to him while continuing to look at <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, Shidou gently dismissed the hand attached as if to protect him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……? What's wrong, Nushi-sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the sound of the alarm continued to roar, Mukuro felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p class="null-p">While keeping his posture low, Shidou continued on while channeling all of his effort into his feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Take care……of the rest!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mukuro was left in the panic, Shidou kicked off against the floor of the briefing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, by tackling <Beast>'s body, he jumped into the hole on the floor along with <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">If <Beast>had been seriously prepared, it would have been impossible to stagger her with a tackle. But perhaps because of her field of vision being inhibited by the smoke, she bent her body backwards as if accepting Shidou's embrace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, but I can't let you destroy this ship any further--for a little bit, I'll accompany you through a stroll in the sky……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A--aa--"</p>
<p class="null-p">While listening to <Beast>'s roar, Shidou--fell into the night sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Nushi----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt a voice calling out from above, but the sound was drowned out by the terrible wind pressure and he couldn't hear the very end of those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">As his consciousness began to waver, he placed all of his strength into his hands in order to release <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">--This was Shidou's simple and clear idea, a method to keep <Beast>away from the ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou wasn't planning on dying. That's why before diving into the sky, Shidou had left those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. --Take care of the rest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Imōtogo! Maria! Nushi-sama has descended downward with <Beast>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro, while managing to contain the screams from leaking out from her throat, quickly communicated the situation to Kotori and Maria.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her head was still in dismay. The impact of Shidou disappearing right in front of her weighed heavily on Mukuro's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">But there wasn't a second that could be spared. The roar, alarm, and dense smoke had hindered everyone else. Only Mukuro, who was right beside Shidou, could accurately grasp the current situation. It was her mission, as the person who Shidou had entrusted those words, to communicate the situation to everyone as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Understood. Voluntary territory expansion. Moving to protect target."</p>
<p class="null-p">The voices of Kotori and Maria echoed in response to Mukuro's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, after a beat, Maria spoke again in quiet voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Capture was broken by <Beast>'s resistance, but temporary protection of Shidou via the voluntary territory has been successful. Effect duration is for around 360 seconds. It will be able to withstand the impact from the fall. But--I can't guarantee anything after that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's fine. Good job, Maria. --And thank you Mukuro. If you weren't here, that may have been delayed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No……not much was done."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than humility, Mukuro's true feelings were marked by regret. While gritting her teeth, she powerlessly frowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Mukuro could only do that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Had the power of the Spirits been at hand, she would have been able to directly help Shidou. --No, before even that, she wouldn't have let Shidou take such dangerous measures.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that thought in mind, a question was raised in her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The mysterious Spirit <Beast>that shouldn't exist. She came inside <Fraxinus>by opening a 'hole' in space.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, despite its shape, it was the same power as the key Angel <Michael>that Mukuro had once held.</p>
<p class="null-p">Does that Spirit have anything to do with Mukuro? Had something related to Mukuro pushed Shidou into a corner. When considering that, Mukuro felt her breathing grow progressively shallower.</p>
<p class="null-p">And--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">For the second time, Mukuro felt her breathing clog up.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to block Mukuro's thoughts, a new alarm resounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's throat trembled as she raised her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then Maria replied while raising her brows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Bad news. With <Beast>rampaging in the air, the location of their predicted fall is significantly off from Tenguu City. In this case, <Beast>will crash into a non-evacuated area."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's eyes widened upon hearing what Maria had said. But then she immediately shook her head to regroup her thoughts and give out instructions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Eject out every <Yggdrafolium>. Before the protection wears off, cover Shidou with another voluntary territory! After that, form a barrier around Shidou and <Beast>! That'll buy us some time until the evacuations of the civilians are over!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood--is what I want to say, but that's impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori raised her eyebrows at Maria's unexpected reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she held out her hand to project an image there. --A simplified silhouette of <Fraxinus>, there were red marks everywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensors and controls were severely damaged by <Beast>'s attack. Remote control of <Yggdrafolium>would prove too difficult now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same moment Kotori chocked, Mukuro involuntarily gave a sullen look.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. The inability to use the <Yggdrafolium>indicated that in less than six minutes from now, there would be no barriers to protect Shidou from the raging <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">And what that would spell would be--</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro wrapped her trimmed hair around her fingertips, tightly squeezing it to suppress the imagination of the worst case scenario coming into her chest.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Hmmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few months before <Beast>appeared in Tenguu City.</p>
<p class="null-p">While sitting in the backseat of a slightly swaying car, Shidou heard this occasional mumbling.</p>
<p class="null-p">The murmurs came from the girl sitting next to him, Hoshimiya Mukuro. She had an innocent childish face with a short stature. However, the safety belt fastening her body wasn't able to hold down her chest, looking like a stream flowing down between two mountain peaks. …….To be honest, it was a troublesome sight of refuge for Shidou's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there were more important things to worry about than that. For a while now, Mukuro was breathing in a restless manner, fidgeting with the braided end of her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Long--hair that was too long. Perhaps if it wasn't wrapped around her neck right now, its length was likely enough to reach the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm……mmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro twisted the tip of the braid, letting it go as if throwing the weight of a chain sickle. Seeing such movements, Shidou bitterly smiled while speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay, Mukuro?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Mun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Shidou's words, Mukuro widened her eyes in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why ask that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you've been playing with your hair for a while now. So I was wondering if you were feeling restless."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Shidou, Mukuro looked down at her own fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nushi-sama is observing Muku closely. But worry not. It's fined."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fined?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite Shidou slanting his head, Mukuro didn't realize the slip up in her own words. Looking back again, she started to play with her hair once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it's always difficult to admit not being okay. Shidou smiled as he turned forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, how much time passed after that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nushi-sama, Nushi-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning to there after being called out by Mukuro, Mukuro was pushing her hair under her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pfff!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, he couldn't help but have a laughing fit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting from the driver's seat, <Ratatoskr>engineer Shiizaki was watching them through the rearview mirror. The car meandered lightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, take it easy Mukuro. You don't have to be so nervous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun? Isn't Muku taking it easy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was an easily seen through lie. ……No, perhaps Mukuro was unaware, but obviously she wasn't her usual self. Her eyes were wandering restlessly, her feet couldn't stop shaking, and occasionally gags like this were interposed.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Although, this may be justifiable.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, this car right now--was heading to the city where Mukuro once lived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro placed her hand on her knees to hold down her shaking feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't have much awareness, but judging from Shidou's response, Mukuro was currently being a little restless. It wasn't her intention to worry him. Mukuro took in a deep breath to calm down her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when she thought about where they were heading, the palpitations grew faster and faster against her own will.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">--According to <Ratatoskr>'s information, this town is said to be where Mukuro's parents and older sister still dwelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Parents and a sister that were not related through a blood connection.</p>
<p class="null-p">A foster family who accepted the orphan Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">The irreplaceable people that taught Mukuro about love.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also--the former location that Mukuro had broken with her own hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now Mukuro was about to step back into a place filled with memories and regrets.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mukuro. Where we are going, if you don't feel well, we can--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said with a worried look. However, Mukuro slowly shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay now. Right now there is Nushi-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, Mukuro is no longer alone. There is Shidou who said he would become her family. There are friends who shared the same background as former Spirits. That was why Mukuro decided to face her past today.</p>
<p class="null-p">--When she was young, Mukuro, who didn't have any relatives, was welcomed into the Hoshimiya household as an adopted child.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her gentle parents and her beloved sister. Surrounding by a wonderful family, she lived a life full of happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">When did it break down……when her sister brought a friend that Mukuro didn't know about.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing special had occurred. It was just that. But for Mukuro at that time, the friend's presence felt like an invader who had taken away her beloved sister from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was when. That was why <Phantom>appeared before Mukuro and turned her into a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro, who had gained the power of the key Angel <Michael>, operated as she desired. She innocently remodeled the world around her so that her parents and older sister would only love her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the use of such unreasonable power was immediately discovered by her parents and sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their response to Mukuro, who now exerted a power that transcended human logic, was--fear and rejection.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it now, it was easy to understand. A girl who they had considered to be their sister and daughter had suddenly transformed into something that wasn't human. Their fear was no surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the Mukuro of that time couldn't bear it.</p>
<p class="null-p">For Mukuro then, her family was everything and being rejected by that family--meant no less than the collapse of her entire world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro closed her parents and sister's memories with <Michael>and fled to space where no one could reach her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She chose to use <Michael>on herself, locking her heart and wandering forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Choosing to not want, feel, or think of anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, all she became was a silent individual orbiting around the planet like an asteroid.</p>
<p class="null-p">An egotistical and selfish Spirit, that was the woman named Hoshimiya Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--a few years later. That Mukuro was discovered, a helping hand forcibly appear to meddle in her affairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was Itsuka Shidou, a part of the current Mukuro's new family.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So--it's fine already. ……To see through whatever happens."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mukuro……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eyebrows."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bfff!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro whispered while pressing the tips of her hair over her eyes. Shidou heavily coughed. The car meandered again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, sorry. It was a joke."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro laughed a little while speaking, then tightening her fist while looking out the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scenery from the olden days flew in from left to right. It was a suburban residential area Houses here were built more slowly than urban areas. "--Can you stop around here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the car approached a hill, Mukuro shouted. Shiizaki, who was sitting on the driver's seat, slowly applied the brakes while quickly replying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is here okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, she took off her seat belt and got out of the car. Shidou followed suit, also leaving the car to line up next to Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hm? Which one is Mukuro's house?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While asking that, Shidou curiously looked around. There should be one. But there was no house at the place where Mukuro asked to stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro briefly replied while point to a house that was 100 meters away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just that movement was marked with a sense of tension. --A nostalgic home, a well-kept garden founded with aged walls. The dark blue roof had skylights which one could use to go outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, yes. She could still remember it clearly. With her older sister, the two of them would climb out to the roof and look at the stars.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Remembering that, the finger pointing to the house began to slightly shake. Her breathing became disturbed. The hair wrapped around her shoulder was trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, noticing this, Shidou silently placed her hand on Mukuro's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">The warm feeling restored her calmness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Sorry, Nushi-sama. My intentions were supposed to come resolved."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My goodness. I am same as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Shidou let out a small laugh. Speaking of which, just like Mukuro, Shidou was also an orphan, one who was adopted into the Itsuka family. --Well, in Shidou's case, the situation was a little more complicated.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-- "…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro's shoulders jolted, turning her gaze from looking at Shidou to back to the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Suddenly, the doors of the house opened, and from there, three figures emerged.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of them was a 50ish year old man. The other was gentle woman that looked almost as old as the man.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the last one--was a tall woman in her mid-20s with plain facial features.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">A small voice leaked out from her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">No doubt, there was no mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone looked a little older, but this was definitely-- They were the parents and sister that had once welcomed Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Father……mother……sis……ter……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Was today a day off? They were all dressed up in plain clothes and chatting in a casual manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, they must have planned on going shopping.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a happy family no matter where one looked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Ah……ah, ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro fell to her knees with a little sob.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Mukuro! Are you okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Mukuro's response, Shidou bent down to his knees while worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she couldn't stop. It wouldn't stop. Tears overflowed from her eyes, dripping and leaking onto the ground. Her cheeks were flushed, her nose was clogged, the sound of a groan oozed out from the back of her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this wasn't something that could be described as lamentation. It didn't come from sadness or regret.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, it was satisfaction that filled Mukuro's lungs right now--</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Thank god……"</p>
<p class="null-p">--It was relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, with her parents and sister right in front of her, Mukuro finally realized.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was--scared. It was terrifying as it was inevitable.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few years ago, her former family had their memories of Mukuro 'sealed' using the power of her Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">The mistake she made. Perhaps it had brought misfortune to her beloved family, she was afraid of that all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a concern so great that, even if asking Kotori about the status of the current Hoshimiya household, it wouldn't be completely wiped away.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the current Hoshimiya family in front of her eyes, even if older, was the same happy one from Mukuro's memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really…….thank god ……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mukuro……"</p>
<p class="null-p">From Mukuro's words and expression, it was easy to guess her true feelings. Shidou gently stroked her back. Mukuro grabbed them hem of Shidou's sleeves and tightly squeezed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, Mukuro-chan, Shidou-kun! You need to hurry! Isn't your family heading out!? And you came all this way to meet them!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Shiizaki called out in a hurry from behind Mukuro and Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, just as she had said, Mukuro's parents and sister were entering into a car. --Incidentally, the one driving was her older sister. Ah, did she obtain her driver's license? Mukuro remembered a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro took in a deep breath, wiping away her tears with the back of her hand as she slowly stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They are living happily. ……Just knowing that is enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">She continued to stare off at her family in the distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--If this harmony is caused by forgetting Muku, so then why should here be any intrusion."</p>
<p class="null-p">With Mio's death, the powers of all of the Spirits had disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Michael>, the key angel possessed by Mukuro, was no exception.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, according to Kotori, just because an Angel has disappeared doesn't mean that something transformed by an Angel's power will revert back immediately. Like the masses manipulated by Miku's voice, Mukuro's family is likely to have still forgotten Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it has also been shown in a few occasions that a key can be used to unlock it. In that case--being confronted by Mukuro might cause the 'closed' memory to be unlock at that very moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……are you sure that's what you want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--That is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro said so while waving to the family car that was departing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while waiting for that figure to disappear, she made a big gesture to take in deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm--"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a feeling of that energy diffusing throughout her entire body. Mukuro raised her face up to the sky, untying the braid on her shoulders and taking steps as if dancing around.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Beautiful golden hair fluttered against the wind and shined brilliantly by the sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">The most important thing for Mukuro was how her older sister praised her for having beautiful hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro caught sight of it at the edge of her eyes, loosening her cheeks while turning to look back at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Nushi-sama. Anything resembling scissors is fine. Do you have anything to cut with?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou widened his eyes, he thought for a bit before opening the car door to bring out a small box cuter knife from the dashboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is all that we have on hand……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's more than adequate."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro gave a small nod as she received it. The blade made a swish sound while extending out--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Mun."</p>
<p class="null-p">She tied her appropriately long hair and cut it in a single breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Shiizaki both let out a startled cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro laughed a little as if finding their expression strangely funny.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was that surprising? Wasn't Nushi-sama informed? Muku will cut her hair."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well……that's right, but. ……Is that okay? That was such a bold decision." "It is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro, with a bright expression, watched the road where her family had departed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When asking Nushi-sama to cut my hair, Muku was surely still lost somewhere in my heart. ……But looking at Ane-sama today, the decision has finally settled in."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had the determination to become a new Mukuro and to never appear before her family again.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that decision didn't show her determination, then nothing else she knew could.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Shidou looked hesitant for a few moments, he soon said those words after loosening his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's words were gentle. Perhaps there was a point for Mukuro choosing to not meet her family. But regardless he had to respect Mukuro's decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were extremely brief words. But glad of his concern, Mukuro turned to smile at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……but it still won't work with my skills. --Will you fix it for me upon returning home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mukuro said that, Shidou took a brief pause before replying-- "Ah, leave it to me. I'll make you the most beautiful girl in the world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly smiling, he replied back.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">--Palpitations became more and more intense. Sweat dripped from behind her forehead, the feeling of her throat being stuck. Her fingertips were numb as it grew difficult to keep standing up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was. Mukuro's family was in danger. Just thinking about it, Mukuro couldn't stand still.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro was half-unconsciously kicking the floor of the briefing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Mukuro!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's voice was coming from behind. But Mukuro continued towards the entrance of the briefing room without any concern.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, just before Mukuro could leave the room, a girl walked in front of her as if already having predicted Mukuro's behavior ahead of time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where are you going, Mukuro-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl spoke in an unnaturally calm voice for this predicament. Glossy black hair and porcelain skin, from that cool gaze a bewitching nature not suiting her stare was oozing out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokisaki Kurumi, she was one of the former Spirit girls and once called the worst Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That should be known. To the bridge, there will be a transfer device there. When reaching that point, send Muku down to the ground."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Mukuro had said, a voice of dismay was heard coming from behind. However, Kurumi narrowed her eyes without showing any surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand your feelings, but what can you do now? If you go without any preparation, you'll likely be killed when <Beast>falls down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That need be of concern. If Muku can buy time for Nushi-sama by drawing attention, if there is the chance of stopping <Beast>from harming</p>
<p class="null-p">Nushi-sama is ever so slightly increased, then this life is worth using……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara……"</p>
<p class="null-p">While stroking her chin with her fingertips, she slanted her head in a playful manner. Mukuro was slightly irritated by Kurumi's attitude and tried to push her legs away from Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't stop me, Kurumi. Muku will--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not stopping you. I just can't afford to lose your precious strength aimlessly. Right--Origami-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those unexpected words from Kurumi, Mukuro widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then another girl walked in to respond. With hair reaching her shoulders, her expression remained emotionless. --Former AST member and Shidou's classmate, Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami kept her cool expression, but there was a certain determination lit in her eyes as she stared at Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--If you are so determined then there is only one method."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Method……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro replied back while faintly raising her brows.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Nn……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Late at night. From a company that lightly violated the Labor Standard Laws, Asahi stretched without any reason while walking back from a drinking party after work.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her back slightly creaked as her shoulders made a dull sound. Even though she's in her mid-twenties, the backlash was still very much felt. She let out a self-depreciating laugh while turning her gaze upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky is full of stars……while not reaching far; the light from the sparse stars did shine.</p>
<p class="null-p">She exhaled a sigh at the comfort of that little shine. To be honest, while not unsatisfactory, it was still somewhat better than the dark nights of the cityscape.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a long time, Asahi loved the stars.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was embarrassing regardless of how it was said. Rather by the time she realized it, looking at the sparkles scattered in the sky, it was to teach that there are about that many unreachable desires for everyone. --Well, perhaps her name also played a role in this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It's been a long time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, such words slipped out from her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no one to hear it. The streets at midnight were quiet and there were no other figures seen out besides Asahi.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the feeling grew a little deeper. --The chance to see the stars had been significantly reduced. When she was a student, she would climb the roof of her house almost every day doing astronomical observations.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her dream at the time was to be an astronomer. Pointing to the position of the star, drawing the constellation, she proudly declared so--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she twisted her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">She talked about her dreams while watching the stars. Certainly, that wasn't wrong. But she can't remember who she told that to.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it her friends, mother, or sister……thinking about it, she shook her head. Surely, it must have been a sister if she had done so, but Asahi has always been an only child.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, old memories being fuzzy should be like this. She concluded that in her mind while shrugging.</p>
<p class="null-p">--And then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was at that moment. Something sparkling was reflected at the edge of her sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, maybe it's a shooting star."</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi turned her face in a hurry, narrowing her eyes to focus.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she could clearly see that there was a trajectory of light being drawn on the dark night sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">However--the situation was strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">The glow of a shooting star, which would normally disappear in an instant, seemed to gradually increase in intensity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, as if gradually approaching here--</p>
<p class="null-p">"------!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking about the light engulfing her field of vision, a terrible shock wave struck Asahi.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">--The explosion and flash overran the sensory organs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugu……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time of feeling the terrible impact reach his body, Shidou let out a low groan of anguish.</p>
<p class="null-p">His entire body felt sluggish and in pain. His sight was wavering. Even the slightest distraction would cause his consciousness to fade.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou managed to contain it all in with his tenacious willpower. As his molars crackled while gritted his teeth, he began standing up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Likely, two years ago, this would have been unbearable for Shidou. However, against so many Spirits and Wizards, for Shidou, who had exerted a power beyond human knowledge, not even this condition could be regarded as the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was still conscious. He could see. His limbs could move. Fatal damage to internal organs--maybe not.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then that was enough. What Shido was trying to do now was not a struggle. What was required from his body wasn't the violence needed to defeat an opponent. But rather to use an expression of dearness, whispering such words while embracing in a hug.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, he gave thanks in his heart that the damage done had only been this much.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was an invisible membrane covering Shidou's body right now. -- Voluntary Territory. A supernatural barrier generated by the Realizer manifestation device.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro must have quickly conveyed his intentions to Maria and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, this was a free fall from an altitude of 15,000 meters. Without this barrier, it wouldn't be strange for Shidou's body to splatter into pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was still here. Slowly, he breathed while raising his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">A night cityscape that wasn't Tenguu City was spreading outward. Apparently, their landing coordinates had shifted due to <Beast>rampaging in the air. Additionally, the impact of <Beast>and Shidou's fall left a large crater on the ground. The paved road had collapsed; the street lights were crushed as sparks of electricity were scattered around.</p>
<p class="null-p">And right in the middle--</p>
<p class="null-p">"----A, a, a--"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was standing still while taking in the moonlight.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>. The only Spirit in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">To that figure, Shidou lightly clenched his fist. --Convinced to himself</p>
<p class="null-p">that his intuition was not mistaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps <Beast>had a sword that transcended space just like Mukuro's Angel. If that was used, it didn't make sense to try and keep her away from <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, from the words <Beast>uttered on the ship, one possibility emerged in Shidou's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, for nothing else other than Shidou's existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know why, but apparently <Beast>came to <Fraxinus>in pursuit of Shidou. So if Shidou went out of the ship together with her, he thought she wouldn't attack <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps he thought it was yearning, if not at least for the lovingly reasoning of holding interest in him, like a sign of obsession over not letting her prey escape--even so that was fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it wasn't a tender emotion, it held significant meaning if Shidou was 'special' as prey.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because at least for her, it showed that there was some feeling of 'attachment'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y, ou……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Swaying, shaking her body like a shimmering haze of malice, <Beast>glared at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou took a deep breath to settle down his heart, receiving that murderous gaze while directly replying back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enough with saying you on and on, my name is Itsuka Shidou. --Nice to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Its……uka……Shi, dou……?"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>called out Shidou's name in a hoarse voice--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Gu, a, a, a, a, a, a, a--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Clutching her head as if feeling a strong headache, her groan was elevated into a scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……A-Are you ok--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A……aaaaaaaa--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tried to approach closer to the suddenly suffering <Beast>, but it didn't seem <Beast>would accept this. Of the swords carried behind, she swung with a sword on the far left end.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the sword's blade shined brightly, emitting numerous rays of light that destroyed the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou kicked against the ground to leap from that spot. Despite the voluntary territory, it wouldn't be possible to eat a direct hit from an Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-- "Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Shidou noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of a violent siren echoed while falling one beat behind Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A non-evacuated area……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou squeezed out from his throat as if groaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, a spacequake warning was issued in Tenguu City where <Beast>had appeared. But there was no warning to take refuge in this region yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fortunately, the place where they had landed wasn't a residence. But he could see spots that represented well-lit buildings from around this crater. If <Beast>continued to rampage as it was, severe damage would occur. "Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou frowned. His thoughts spun around while keeping watch of <Beast>. --Like he thought, a single person alone wouldn't amount to much here. But this changed the story completely. He couldn't let anything be done to the civilians. It seemed they were outside the suburbs. There weren't that many people. But right now was around midnight. It would take longer to evacuate the people than during the day. How long would it take for them to all leave? Could he suppress <Beast>until then? No, not suppress. This was a capture. The other alternative was--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Aaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>'s roar broke Shidou's thinking. At the same time, the sword emitted again countless rays of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">His thoughts caused a delay in his movements. The white light pierced through the night and struck Shidou's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Collision, the voluntary territory surrounding Shidou's body responded by concentrating all of its strength at that single point.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to that, Shidou didn't end up losing his arm--but it seemed that the voluntary territory couldn't withstand that impact. The invisible barrier protecting Shidou dispersed without any sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">It indicated there will be no 'next time'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But now Shidou couldn't escape from that spot. In front of <Beast>right now, Shidou couldn't keep his distance. Running away randomly would harmfully affect the inhabitants that haven't evacuated yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, Shidou decided once again. Bracing his legs, raising up his hands, he screamed so loudly it felt like this throat would collapse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I'm! I want to know more about you! Who are you!? I bear no hostility! I just want to talk to you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----,----"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>subtly reacted to Shidou's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--that was it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aa……!"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>raised a brief voice and swung her sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rays of lights ripping through the darkness stretched towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stiffened himself in preparation for the impact.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, in such a position, a living human being couldn't survive an attack from an Angel. But Shidou didn't give up. He wouldn't let go of the choice he had made.</p>
<p class="null-p">--That was why, this wouldn't miss Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Light fell from the sky to prevent <Beast>'s attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now way, did a meteorite conveniently fell down? He raised his face and widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, there was a huge diamond-shaped leaf that gave off a radiant glow.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Yggdrafolium>. The autonomous operating unit that <Fraxinus>was proud of. Apparently, rather than a miracle saving him, it was <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't all. A small silhouette descended down as Shidou was looking up at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Are you safe, Nushi-sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Mukuro!? What are you doing here!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou involuntarily shouted at the girl who suddenly appeared here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, Mukuro, a girl who should have been on <Fraxinus>, had landed on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">--On her head, she was wearing something resembling a small headset.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. With the damages incurred on <Fraxinus>, it seems no longer possible to remotely operate the <Yggdrafolium>. --Muku and the others have arrived to serve as the <Yggdrafolium>'s eyes for as much as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou opened his eyes in astonishment, a number of footsteps were heard coming from behind in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, I mean, it's going to happen regardless of coming here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku, fear not for we have arrived!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Support. Yuzuru and the others will pave the way for Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! It's unfair for Darling to have a date with the Spirit-san alone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, the girls wearing the same headset as Mukuro marched forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi, Kaguya, Yuzuru, and Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">And from behind, Origami, Nia, Kurumi, and Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, nine girls arrived at the battlefield while taking along portions of the huge <Yggdrafolium>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You all--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched his fist at this spectacular sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">--This was a dangerous battlefield. They were facing a mysterious Spirit using her power tyrannically. It wasn't a good place for them who have lost their Reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Run away." "Don't come here." "This is too dangerous." --</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be normal to utter such words. Indeed, if this was 2 years ago, he would have said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But right now Shidou could understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">How prepared these girls must be to stand at this spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Shidou didn't want them to be hurt--maybe even more than that --the girls also valued him as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, the words said to these girls had already been decided. "--Aah. Please, everyone. Please lend me your strength."</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls all responded by means of their own respective thoughts and words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro let out a groan from her throat while exaggeratingly moving both of her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in response, the giant metal 'leaf' floating in the air let out a high driving force sound as it flew behind to Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, this was the secret plan that Origami had discussing in <Fraxinus>'s briefing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only the operating system and sensors were destroyed by <Beast>. Because the <Yggdrafolium>itself was still alive, the Realizer Manifestation Device performed by <Fraxinus>can be operated by hand--</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, the operating staff for these white feather arrows to stand up was Mukuro and the other former Spirit girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">According to Origami, even an experienced Wizard would have difficulty manipulating the Realizer Manifestation Device was usually entrusted to <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the Realizer Manifestation Device was originally created based on the power of the Spirits. It could be said that, Mukuro and the others, who once had Reiryoku and wielded Angels, should be familiar with manipulating this invisible power.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a matter of fact, the operation of the <Yggdrafolium>resembled the feeling of manipulating an Angel. --At the very least, immediately after participating, they were able to block an attack coming to Shidou from <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Aa……"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>let out a low roar while glaring in turn at Mukuro and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked as if being on alert to the new enemies that suddenly appeared in front of her--but actually she seemed to be looking at the strange sight of her attack being obstructed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation was as desired. Mukuro and the others were exerting a power beyond the domain of humans. But to the bitter end, it was only feasible through denoting the route of the <Yggdrafolium>. In the first place, the strength of the <Yggdrafolium>was not comparable to a Spirit. If it came to pure force, the difference would mean immediately being blown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, the commander Kotori already knew this. Instructions were being issued from the bridge through the headset.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Split up into three groups! Three people for responding to <Beast>! Three people for protecting Shidou! And also--three people for evacuating and rescuing the neighboring residents! ……<Yggdrafolium>is a lump of secret technology, but that's a trivial matter right now! I'll manage the flow of information from here, so please do your best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls all responded to Kotori's command.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each one kicked off the ground to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, Kaguya, and Yuzuru surrounded <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi, Yoshino, and Miku were behind Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Mukuro, Natsumi, and Nia left the battlefield to head to the town district being destroyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each division was not given detailed instructions in advance. However, by wearing the headset given by Maria, everyone was vaguely aware of their role the moment they linked their consciousness to the <Yggdrafolium>.</p>
<p class="null-p">The <Yggdrafolium>itself had no clear difference in performance. However, the girls that manipulated them had different areas of specialties depending on the nature of their Angels and Reiryoku they had in the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">That wasn't to say that Mukuro didn't have the desire to protect Shidou. But right now each person was doing what they could and above all she knew that doing this would also help Shidou. Dashing across the ground with Nia and Natsumi, they reached a collapsed building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let's go <Yggdrafolium>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Nia impulsively made an exaggerated pose just like a tokusatsu hero. While staring at this sight, Natsumi half-closed her eyes as sweat dripped down from her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is there any meaning in something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying? Roboko also said something like that. Such assumptions are a very important foundation. So that is why, go <Yggdrasearch>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia closed her eyes, gathering her concentration while shouting out the name of a mysterious technique. Then, as Nia manipulated the <Yggdrafolium>, the voluntary territory expanded while being accompanied by a high-pitched driving force noise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Un! There are two people underneath that building and one person over there! Fortunately, everyone is conscious with minor injuries. I'll leave it to you, Mukku-chin!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">After receiving Nia's commands, Mukuro and Natsumi each headed towards the designated building.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Nia, who had the omniscient Angel <Rasiel>, excelled in searching using the voluntary territory. Natsumi and Mukuro, who had Angels with special abilities like <Haniel>and <Michael>, excelled in exquisite manipulation of the voluntary territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Mun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro focused her consciousness, manipulating the <Yggdrafolium>to wrap the collapsed building in the voluntary territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she gently floated the rubble to not hurt anyone underneath it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, from underneath the rubble, a man crouching and covering his head appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Y-You are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Mukuro called out, the man slightly shook his shoulders before raising his face. Soon he must have noticed the rubble trapping him was now floating upward. His eyes widened in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A Spacequake. You should evacuate now. Can you stand alone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, ah……o-oh……somehow……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps he thought he was still dreaming? The man staggered, pinching his cheeks as he ran to the shelter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. Then next up. --Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. Then please go over there next!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro turned around, receiving the new instructions from Nia and continued rescuing the civilians one after the other.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ugh, ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've done well hanging in there. I'll remove the rubble now--"</p>
<p class="null-p">How many times has this been repeated so far? She was now trying to help a woman who was sandwiched in-between two fallen walls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro's breathing choked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her concentration was interrupted for a moment, and the rubble that was floating was about to fall again. In a hurry, she maintained the voluntary territory to stop it just in the brink of time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that didn't mean her disturbed mental state had gone back to normal. Her heart, which had maintained a constant rhythm, was now going off like an alarm bell. Sweat was gushing out from her entire body. Even when standing before <Beast>, the trembling wasn't this bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hey, Mukku-chin. It's still stuck in place. Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps finding Mukuro's actions to be odd, Nia could be heard speaking from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, for Mukuro right now, there was no turning back.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't unreasonable.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, in front of Mukuro's eyes right now was--</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Ane--sama……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because it was the dear sister-in law who once loved Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh--,……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi--Hoshimiya Asahi was suddenly stunned hearing a voice leak out from her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the midst of her hazy consciousness, she remembered what had happened to herself. --Ah, that's right. On the way back from the company, the next moment after seeing what she thought was a shooting star, a terrible shock wave struck her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she really get involved in the impact of a meteorite? ……No, if it were that, then Asahi couldn't be alive right now. Her entire body was marked with an aching pain, but conversely it showed that Asahi was still alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Asahi noticed. The weight of the concrete wall covering her body until now was gone. She thought that a rescue squad or the JGSFD had come to help--but that wasn't it. From a glance, the piece of concrete that was crumbling like a biscuit was floating above Asahi as if unaffected by gravity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What the……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't understand what this meant. Did she hit her head when the wall collapsed? Asahi frowned while rubbing her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then--over there, she noticed one more thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">A small girl was standing in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">From her appearance, she looked around the age of a junior high student. Her silk-like hair, which was neatly arranged, was shining brightly in the moonlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because she was so excessively beautiful, Asahi wondered for a moment if she had arrived at heaven--but looking at her expression, that idea quickly changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes were wide open in astonishment, her lips were trembling slightly. It was as if she had seen something unexpected.</p>
<p class="null-p">And her gaze was fixed on Asahi. She looked at herself in a hurry. --But there weren't any serious injuries on her person that would traumatize her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Umm……is there something on my face……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! N-No……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Asahi asked her while feeling confused, the girl's shoulders trembled as she was shaking her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while doing something like trying to cover her face, she called out to Asahi again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you……stand up? It is dangerous here……you should evacuate immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……ah, un. Could it be you're the one that saved me……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mun. Such is the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Watching the girl hesitate in nodding, Asahi slightly strained her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she heard this girl's characteristic reply, a slight headache struck Asahi.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, she thought that her head could no longer keep up with the current events. --A sudden meteor. Explosion. Collapse. And a girl who saved her with a mysterious power. A physic user? A mage? She wondered if everything seen right now was a dream or hallucination. Given that, this headache could also be explained.</p>
<p class="null-p">But why was it?</p>
<p class="null-p">This headache seemed to be due to something more fundamental.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moreover, that was to say, after seeing this girl's face, after hearing her voice, rather than interest in the paranormal events that had struck, the focus on her was overwhelming.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't even know what this meant. There was no explanation at all. Why was there such a feeling for a girl she had just met? First meeting--yes, it should be their first meeting. She wasn't in her memories. That's why--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, a terrible explosion sounded from somewhere, causing Asahi's body to shake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……Has it begun? Evacuate soon……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl shouted while staring at the direction of the explosion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"G-Got it……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite not knowing what it was, it seemed like something serious was occurring nearby. Asahi ignored all of the doubts and suspicion lingering in her head and placed all of her strength in her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a strange feeling. But the first and foremost priority was her life. As this girl said, it would be best to evacuate as soon as possible. Judging from that, Asahi stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Waa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because she got up in a hurry, Asahi lost her balance and fell down on her stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Ane-sama!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the girl immediately offered her hand to support her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi felt her field of vision flicker as some sensation occurred in her brain.</p>
<p class="null-p">The feeling of that girl's hand, and the name the girl had called out.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a comparison--it was the feeling of a lock in her head being opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment that was blocked became a tremendous torrent that filled her thoughts. Struck by a fierce dizziness, numbness reached her fingertips and toes. Even while being supported, standing became difficult.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, yes. That's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">--She, I know this girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did she forget? This girl was--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mu, kuro……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">That girl--Mukuro, choked on her breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro. Hoshimiya Mukuro. A girl who was once adopted into Asahi's household.</p>
<p class="null-p">A cute little sister with beautiful long hair that always followed her. Asahi, who always wanted a sister, loved Mukuro so much that it could be described as doting.</p>
<p class="null-p">But……ah, that's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">When was it? --Mukuro turned into 'something' that she couldn't understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a power beyond human wisdom, manipulating the human heart, turning into something unknown.</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi, who noticed this, feared Mukuro--and rejected her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The last memory was revived at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro's face staring at her while shedding tears--</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">From that point on, she couldn't remember.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least until then, until now, Asahi had forgotten about Mukuro's existence. No, not only Asahi. Father, mother, the people around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">No one remembered Mukuro; it was as if it was a fact that Asahi never had a sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">In retrospect, Mukuro must have done something to them. As she could see, Mukuro was still exhibiting paranormal abilities. It's been years since then and she only seemed a little bit older. Speaking of cosmetic changes, it looked like she had trimmed her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she realized this, the sense of fear that had disappeared into oblivion had resurrected. One day, it felt as if something unknown had taken over her sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps taking in what Asahi was feeling, Mukuro's shoulders trembled as if she was frightened. She soon released her hands from Asahi. "……Your safety is best of all. ……Hurry, and flee to a safe place."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she smiled weakly while turning her back to Asahi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, Asahi felt her heart being tightly squeezed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Mukuro was terrifying during that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what about the girl standing in front of her right now?</p>
<p class="null-p">While being rejected by her sister after such a long time, but still showing concern about her--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Mukuro!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she noticed this, Asahi stopped Mukuro from leaving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro faintly twitched as she stopped her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even after that, Asahi didn't know what words to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Mukuro was no longer human by that time. Mukuro, who knew this, disappeared from them--and then Asahi and everyone else spent years without ever realizing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">What occurred in Asahi's head was a tremendous regret far greater than her fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, this could be a long-sealed emotion within Asahi. An emotion that couldn't be felt because of forgetting Mukuro, it was an irredeemable crime for not even recognizing that Mukuro was gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she had more time, she could have been able to hear Mukuro out.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she had more time, she might have been able to understand Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, Asahi was a prisoner of her own fear, and could only reject Mukuro. She could only let go of her cute little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even then, Mukuro came to save her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now she was heading somewhere. Asahi still didn't know anything. But she was doing what needed to be done right now, Like for her, she was trying to help others. That was--something she could understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Then, what should Asahi say? Which words should she say to her beloved sister that she once rejected and betrayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't hurt her. Don't shut her away. Don't turn your back on her. Don't let yourself waver.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the end of a journey that seemed like forever, what Asahi said was--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Your hair……you cut it……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was such an irrelevant everyday conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it couldn't be helped. It was the only thing Asahi could say amidst this confusion and turmoil.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--……, Mun……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing what Asahi had said, Mukuro's gaze faintly faltered.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like, she seemed somewhat scared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Sorry. There was already no intention of appearing before Ane-sama anymore. But……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro said so in a slightly trembling voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi silently walked and reached out to touch Mukuro's hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hair trimmed to a length that it reached the back was covered in dust and soot. She must have been sweating a lot. The touch felt rugged and not comparable to the silky feeling in her memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">But from that dirty hair, the history she had been walking until now could be felt.</p>
<p class="null-p">The life of a Mukuro unknown to Asahi had been engraved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It's always beautiful like since then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi smiled while speaking, stroking her head before letting go.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do your best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------Mun. Thank you, Ane-sama."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_22_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">She listened to Asahi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro nodded before beginning to move her stationary feet once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then Nia, who was waiting for Mukuro, asked while slightly raising her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, Mukku-chin. Could that be your older sister? Perchance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's right. Even though sworn to never see her again in this lifetime, to have imagined accomplishing a reunion like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">There were no lies in her vows or resolution. Mukuro wasn't going to appear before her in her lifetime.</p>
<p class="null-p">But now, having been reunited by some mischief of fate, Mukuro's heart was lit up from hearing those unexpected words.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a burning determination even stronger than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Mukuro, Nia glanced at Asahi while scratching her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Strange things can really occur. ……But then even more so, wouldn't it have been better to give more words of gratitude since this is a reunion after such a long absence?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Nia's words, Mukuro briefly replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't there anything better than this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response, Nia widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she noticed. Warm tears were leaking out from both of Mukuro's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see. Then, you'll need to do your best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro nodded, wiping off the tears and kicking off the ground for the next rescue.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"--What is the evacuation situation in the area!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Currently about 85%! We have dispatched evacuation guidance personnel from <Ratatoskr>, so it should be completed soon!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hurry it up, no matter how many <Yggdrafolium>, they are ordinary humans now. They won't be able to fight for long."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the bridge of the aerial warship <Fraxinus>, the voices of Kotori and the crew members were going back and forth. The situation in the area, the response to <Beast>, the directives to the girls--they quickly gave instructions while closely observing the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The main monitor of the bridge showed the ground level where Shidou and the girls were.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, it wasn't the usual autonomous camera sending footage to the bridge, but rather the small camera mounted to the girl's headsets.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls facing <Beast>couldn't stay in one spot for long, which inevitably caused vibrations to accompany the images received as feedback.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh. I really am a little drunk right now……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't whine. Hurry up and restore the sensors!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Understood……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Under Kotori's command, <Fraxinus>crew member, Mikimoto Masaomi resumed his work. After Kotori confirmed that, she turned to look at behind the captain's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. A strange scene was unfolding there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm, fufufu, fufufu, fufufu……♪"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're too noisy Kannazuki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please be a bit quieter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you can, please stop breathing."</p>
<p class="null-p">And etc.</p>
<p class="null-p">A tall man with his eyes down was moving his hands just like a conductor. Girls with the same face glared at him with eyes half-closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">This man was Kannazuki Kyouhei, the deputy captain of <Fraxinus>. And these girls were all Maria's interface bodies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, excuse me. This is the best way for me to concentrate. In the first place, wasn't it Maria who requested me to take control of the ship?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't want to ask Kannazuki if I could have done it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been thinking about this for a long time. But for this operation, a device for direct control through using brainwaves connected to the Realizer Manifestation Device, is this not sexual harassment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Once this is done, we'll make a formal complaint. At best now, tremble and close your eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Geez, you'll make me give in with those vicious words……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki contorted his body while blushing. <Fraxinus>'s hull slightly shook to match those actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">That should be it. Right now <Fraxinus>'s navigation was being controlled by the Wizard Kannazuki Kyouhei.</p>
<p class="null-p">While it was usually an emergency tool used for battle, the damage received from <Beast>was unexpectedly large--and also, Maria needed to devote her attention to something else.</p>
<p class="null-p">About ten Marias were lined up in the bridge. Everyone was sitting uniformly in a P.E posture with cables connected to their necks. Each body had its own calculation equipment running in parallel with each other while they were talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So then--can you do the analysis?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, who do you think I am?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The representative Maria answered Kotori's question. Kotori lightly shrugged her shoulders at those frivolous words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, right now Maria was in charge of analyzing <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't just the normal favorability levels and mental state analysis. Through the <Yggdrafolium>on the scene, she was examining the power of <Beast>itself--and also the ten swords she was wielding.</p>
<p class="null-p">Obviously, the crew initially objected. That's right. With Maria's body, it was possible to operate the <Yggdrafolium>without sending the former Spirit girls to this dangerous battlefield.</p>
<p class="null-p">But eventually Kotori accepted Maria's proposal. There was no way she could control Mukuro and the other's desire to help Shidou--and above all else, Kotori knew they couldn't capture her without knowing anything about <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>. A mysterious Spirit that shouldn't exist. Who she is--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori raised her eyebrows in alarm.</p>
<p class="null-p">A beeping sound came from Maria's interface body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maria?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Analysis complete. ……In one word, puzzling. In two words, very confusing. Why would that be there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop joking. So who is she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori asked, Maria replied while disconnected the cable from her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know her identity yet. But those ten swords she carries. That's--"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she continued on while watching <Beast>be reflected on the monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Angels once owned by Kotori and the others."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 7: Kyouno Natsumi</p>
<p class="null-p">Humans are, by nature, divided into the leading actors and those who are not.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every existence is different, and the have nots are no match for those who do have.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Effort? When has that ever worked out for someone?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't believe in reincarnation, but I can't help but believe that my previous life was some sort of villain. Killing and killing. Stealing and stealing. A great villain rejected by the entire world and forsaken by both God and Buddha. Enough crimes that it would take 7 times reincarnating to repent --what? ……Like this, wouldn't anyone give up a little?</p>
<p class="null-p">……So, I'm quite grateful to Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Haniel>changed 'me' to 'me but not me'.</p>
<p class="null-p">And above all else, it gave me the chance to meet everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">……No, that's not right. In my bullshit life, I think there is only one good thing. With just this one point, I think its fine to write off everything else.</p>
<p class="null-p">If a convenient Goddess appeared now and said to choose between 'the same garbage life as before' and 'a promise of a successful life where I can't meet everyone', I think I would choose the former.</p>
<p class="null-p">But……no, so that's why.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once in a while, there's this anxious feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">A supporting role that has slipped into the leading role.</p>
<p class="null-p">A have not trying to join a group that do have.</p>
<p class="null-p">An ugly duckling trying to grow up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Am I--really good to be here?</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">February. One month before <Beast>appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">In one room of the soaring mansion next to the Itsuka household, Natsumi was staring at the envelope placed on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like this has been going on for almost an hour now. She didn't check in the mirror, but her usually sullen eyes had an even steeper expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this was inevitable. After all, it contained information of when Natsumi was human.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Natsumi had once refused to view the contents, but after that she visited Kotori again to secretly receive the envelope.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few days ago, her mind had changed. This was when she visited the city where Yoshino once lived with Shidou and Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wondered why, looking at Yoshino at that time, feeling the thoughts of Yoshino's mother entrusted to 'Yoshinon'--Natsumi felt her heart intensely shaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she didn't think her personal history was as wonderful as Yoshino's past. Indeed, as shown, the envelope handed to Natsumi seemed thinner than Yoshino's. As expected, she was a thin person with a thin history. Natsumi remembered a mysterious feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Natsumi taking action would be very noticeable. Visiting Kotori with an awkward face, it took 30 minutes to get to the main topic and she received the envelope from Kotori who was growing a little impatient.</p>
<p class="null-p">……But still.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even with every action taken so far, when trying to check the contents, "…… I mean, I just got it for the time being, but is it always good to check?" the little Natsumi of sloth living in her heart whispered. Incidentally, there were seven little Natsumi in total, with the trademark of the little Natsumi of sloth being laying down like the image of the reclining Buddha and a chubby stomach protruding out from a tight kusoda jersey.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ehh, the hell with it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, there was no point to keeping this situation up forever. Natsumi decided to open the envelope and soon began to retrieve the documents inside. There was no special meaning to it, but it was naturally thin.</p>
<p class="null-p">The documents were slowly exited the mouth of the envelope, and the characters written on it gradually became visible.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first thing she could see was--a full name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Kyouno, Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Reading the text on the document, Natsumi thinly sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the mysterious feeling of having a family name, the strange relief that it was a surprisingly ordinary surname filled her lungs.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was it. For Natsumi who had completely lost her memories of the past, it was just new information.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, it was also the same for Yoshino as well. When looking at her name, looking at the photos, looking at her entire background, it all didn't seem real. Yoshino remembered everything after visiting the hospital room where she had spent her days being hospitalized.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, for Natsumi to remember the past, does she also need to visit where she once lived?</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, it felt……awkward. It would be difficult to go alone, but to have Shidou and Yoshino accompany her would be embarrassing--</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very next moment, Natsumi flinched from the sudden pain coming from her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, ah, ah, ah, ah……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if a sharp needle had pierced her head, the intense headache was like a needle branching out from within her head. She dropped the envelope and involuntarily crouched down on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, the contents of the envelope were gorgeously scattered and came into Natsumi's view. A face photo. Family structure. The city where she once lived. The time of disappearance when she turned into a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in response to that, the headache increased in intensity--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, Natsumi felt something rising from the back of her stomach. Severe vomiting. She rushed to the toilet while holding down her mouth unintentionally, spewing out vomit into the toilet. Her throat and tongue were irritated by the regurgitated stomach acid.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Uhh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The urge to vomit wouldn't go away even though there was nothing left to puke out. Natsumi wiped away her tears and half-forced herself to adjust her breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah……haah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, how much time had passed? The headache, although little by little, began to subside.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this melancholic mood didn't clear up. ……That's right. After all, that headache had left something extraordinary in Natsumi's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Wow, really. …..Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">……Ah, ah. It really was instantaneous when compared to Yoshino. Right……just looking at some of the documents, Natsumi remembered her memories of being human.</p>
<p class="null-p">And--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was exactly at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">The intercom in the room made a nimble sound as if calling for Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi raised her face that was as pale as ghost and walked towards the entrance like a moth lured to a lamp.</p>
<p class="null-p">Opening the lock, opening the door. Then--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Hello, Natsumi-san. Is everything okay right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, it's everyone's idol, Yoshinon! How are you doing Natsumi-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A gentle girl with fluffy hair, Yoshino, and a lovely rabbit puppet, Yoshinon, energetically jumped into Natsumi's field of vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino…….Yoshinon……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……what happened, Natsumi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you look a little groggy? Did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as they saw Natsumi, Yoshino and Yoshinon gave a worried look. Natsumi shook her head back and forth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I don't think so. It's almost usually like this. The usual operation, the usual operation."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi said so, Yoshino replied with, "I-Is that right……?" and seemed to be convinced for the time being. Just for once, Natsumi thanked the gloomy face she usually had during normal times.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, because it was the kind Yoshino, she might have already known but was taking Natsumi's circumstances into consideration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm, more importantly, what do you want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, there's a movie I want to watch, so if you would like, please join us. But if you're not feeling well, please don't overdo it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, okay, okay. Great, a movie. I just wanted to watch one too. Yup. Then I'll go change clothes now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…….yes. But……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Natsumi's increasingly empty reply, Yoshino looked worried once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Natsumi smiled weakly while staring into Yoshino's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, Yoshino."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……As expected, Yoshino is a goddess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Wha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Natsumi had said, Yoshino rounded her eyes. Natsumi smiled again at Yoshino's reaction, closing the door after saying, "hold on a minute".</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">--The center of the townscape had been absurdly destroyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">A huge brilliant 'leaf' surrounded the beast of ruin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Don't……get in my waaaay------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Beast raised an unusual roar, swinging either the 'claw' on her right hand or the 'sword' carried from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in line with that, a slash that could cut through anything, a multitude of beams of light, fire, and cold air surged out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshinon-san, Miku-san, please add another layer to the voluntary territory!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Obeying Kurumi's commands, the three sheets of <Yggdrafolium>formed an invisible wall in front of Shidou. After offsetting <Beast>'s attack, it shattered without any sound as if saying it's role had been finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Ha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, accompanied by Origami's voice, another barrier formed around <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">A territory that binds power was different than the one protecting Shidou. The ground around <Beast>collapsed slightly as if crushed by an invisible hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……If this doesn't work……then nothing will……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, <Beast>escaped from the constraint in a single move, swinging her 'claw' aiming at Origami. Origami, who was only one among the girls wearing a CR-Unit, gently turned around to dodge the attack and left behind a trail of light in the night sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">As <Beast>rampaged, the girls were somehow able to use the <Yggdrafolium>to suppress it.</p>
<p class="null-p">--From earlier, how many times did this scene repeat? As Shidou realized that, he clenched his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, with everyone's help, the situation had managed to improve. Shidou was no longer finished in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even with such lifesaving support, Shidou was still unable to communicate with <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was just stalling for time and repeating that act on this dangerous tightrope. In this extreme state, he was trying his best to continue living. That was all that was done until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their current status was a dangerous struggle that depended on relying on everyone's power. Being in such a quandary caused Shidou's heartbeat to gradually increase.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-- "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this crisis, Shidou felt his consciousness focus and sharpen.</p>
<p class="null-p">A strange feeling was born in the corner of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of everyone's blessing, he had the chance to closely watch <Beast>, examining the uncomfortable feeling of discomfort in her movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, <Beast>was rampaging violently. Firing attacks off one by one, a single blow was enough to completely change the scenery of the townscape.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the attacks didn't seem to be particularly aimed at anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite operating the <Yggdrafolium>, everyone now had the bodies of ordinary humans. If <Beast>really wanted to get rid of everyone, they wouldn't have been able to hold out for so long.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he would compare this--yes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if she had too many emotions that it was beyond control.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or a spoiled child violently moving her limbs.</p>
<p class="null-p">An unbearable sadness, someone crying out of not knowing what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Ah, that's right. He remembered this feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt this way two years ago, on a spring day when Shidou met a Spirit for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Darling! Watch out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou's eyes widened after he heard Miku's voice. -- <Beast>'s attack had broken through Miku's voluntary territory and was now approaching Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was negligent. Because of being distracted by these thoughts, his response was delayed for a moment, Shidou leaped from that spot, gritting his teeth in preparation for the shockwave and severe pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">But. The pain he had expected never occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">A new <Yggdrafolium>, which appeared in the sky, formed a new barrier to protect Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fool. It's all over if you get done in. I won't forgive you from dying of carelessness."</p>
<p class="null-p">A small girl appeared along with a <Yggdrafolium>, speaking with sweat dripping from her cheeks. Her face was pale and her hair ragged from the intense exercise. Although her eyes looked strained from being in a bad mood, this wasn't just from Shidou's carelessness. It was just how they usually looked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi……! Thank you, you saved me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Un."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou called out her name, Natsumi looked away while lightly huffing from her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya! Natsumi-san is so cool! I'll hug you later as thanks!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's more of a punishment game than giving thanks……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Natsumi play an active role, Miku bent her body loosely back and forth as her eyes sparkled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, from behind Natsumi, the footsteps of two other people could be heard. --Mukuro and Nia, both of whom were involved with evacuated the residents along with Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you safe, Nushi-sama!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The rescue has been completed safely! Now, this is the main performance!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, they turned to <Beast>to protect Shidou. --He could tell in his heart that Mukuro's heart was full of energy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, thank you, you three. But--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou faintly tensed up his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, it was great that they didn't have to worry about the local residents and he was grateful for Natsumi and the others participating in this battle. However, even with their strength increased, he didn't think they could get out of this stalemate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, something else was needed. Like something that could peel away at <Beast>'s power--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Yes, from here on out, it's the main performance."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">A crisp voice came from above as if to interrupt Shidou's thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his face to look at the owner of this voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he could notice, she had appeared there. Accompanied by shimmering <Yggdrafolium>floating in the air, Kotori was standing there with her arms folded calmly. "Kotori!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Imōtogo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls all call out her name. Kotori turned around to respond to those cries as she lightly descended onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened imoto-chan? For the commander to arrive directly onto the battlefield. Or maybe you wanted to help your Onii-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not inaccurate."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori replied to Nia's joke while slightly shaking her black and white ribbons. Not expecting that reply, Nia whistled in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's not just for sentimental reasons. I came here to--render <Beast>completely naked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou asked in return, as if to match that, <Beast>let out a roar as she fired off another slash attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to that attack, the defense team formed their voluntary territory and the attack team kicked off against the ground as that unfolded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, Maria's voice echoed from the intercom he had received from Mukuro earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Let me explain about that. Please listen while fighting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently the transmission was reaching everyone through their headset. He could see nearby that Natsumi and Miku also gave a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me describe it from the conclusion. The ten swords carried by <Beast>. --While they may be different in shape, they all have the same response as the Angel you all once had."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Maria speak, the girls all let out a cry of confusion. But that wasn't without reason. The weapons that this mysterious Spirit was wielding, they were giving off the same reaction as their Angels which should have disappeared along with Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">But why? After hearing that, Shidou felt strangely convinced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Flames to light, cold air to wind, and even a key sword that can open a 'hole' in space--</p>
<p class="null-p">They all certainly shared a resemblance to the power of the Spirits he had sealed up until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still don't know who <Beast>is. Could it really be a Spirit from the past or future, or perhaps even an existence from another world--?</p>
<p class="null-p">But what's important now is that the power she wields is the same type as you guys."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, even if you say that, what is going on……to lead the conversation with the same ability I had in the past, has anything resembling a cartoon appeared</p>
<p class="null-p">yet……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From behind, Natsumi's voice marked with suspicion was heard. Maria coughed a little before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen to the story until the very end. --Everyone, please raise your hand forward."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……? Like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. What does this mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls all followed Maria's command and extended out one hand forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, to match that motion, from the sky--from the direction of <Fraxinus>, dazzling light poured down on the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is--"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the girls were wrapped in the light for a moment, they all raised a surprised voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then delivered onto the hands they raised, something resembling faintly shining weapon was seized.</p>
<p class="null-p">In terms of shape, it closely resembled a Wizard's laser blade. From the tip of the metal handle, a blade of light around 30 centimeters appeared from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the shape wasn't as smooth as what a Wizard would handle. The twisted shape was reminiscent of a huge tree branch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Yggdraramus>. --Let's call it that. An experimental weapon modeled after Mukuro's <Michael>. By inserting the blade into the Spirit's body, that power is detached--in short; you can peel off an Angel from a Spirit." "Peel off--the Angel?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What's with that heavy demo weapon? If there was such a convenient thing, why didn't you bring it out earlier? Were you waiting for the excitement here to swell in order to give it overemphasis? That's what Roboko is acting like."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Nia complained, Maria replied with a slight tinge of annoyance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not a third rate manga artist and I won't do that. I would say this weapon is at the experimental stage. It's still far from practical use yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Indeed, this weapon can theoretically separate an Angel from a Spirit. But that's just for a moment. If a Spirit is like a planet, then an Angel is a satellite. Immediately, there will be a pull reuniting the two together. It would have been too risky to approach the Spirit just for that achievement."</p>
<p class="null-p">But then, Maria continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only now, the story has changed. For a moment. It doesn't matter if for an instant. If you can separate the Angels from <Beast>--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori raised her voice to take over speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Over here, just like <Beast>, there are ten former Spirit girls with the same gravitation pull for the Angels?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls all filled their voices with surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the same for Shidou. Anyway, it may be now possible to take the Angels away from <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you can do that--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If, not really. We will make it happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said to inspire everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go, everyone. --To push our swords into <Beast>."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking vigorously, girls kicked off the ground and headed for the rampaging Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haah."</p>
<p class="null-p">In this battlefield marked by the smell of iron carried by the wind and a flash of lightning, Natsumi was the only one to give a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, she was well aware that this was a tense situation. And this wasn't as if she was distracted.</p>
<p class="null-p">But no matter how powerful the enemy is, there was always a strange sense of relief coming from them working together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, <Beast>had a mighty power. Honestly, she didn't know what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, with Kotori participating in this war and the secret weapon presented by Maria, the clues to capture had come to light. Consequently, a slight fluctuation was born from within Natsumi's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Despite this crisis, there was still a light to be seen. As expected of Kotori. As expected of Maria. They were selected protagonists who were different from Natsumi. If left to everyone, everything would come to a close smoothly. After all, there were a number of excellent people here. The Yamai sisters with their high physical ability, the superdreadnought battleship</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro, the flawless superwoman Origami who was wearing her CR-Unit and Kurumi who refused to die even after being killed. Yoshino is a goddess and Miku is as strong as a demon when it comes to a beautiful girl. Nia well, she's good at manga. It felt like that last point was something like that had already been thought up before.</p>
<p class="null-p">To phrase it positively, this was trust. To phrase it negatively, this was negligence. Certainly, someone skilled will push that sword into <Beast>and Shidou will seal that power. Such was the vague vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">She mustn't head out. Even if mistaken, don't disturb everyone. Even if</p>
<p class="null-p">helpful, even if useless, if she gets involved it'll become negative for everyone. Because I'm--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As such thoughts flipped past her head, Natsumi instinctively frowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Why did she think of that now?</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a thought that should have been overcome once. Relying on others to achieve the objective. Leaving it to everyone else. Despite the thoughts of concern for her precious friends, to have a backwards attitude that won't take any action. It was as if she reverted back to the Natsumi before meeting Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">While still the ever pessimistic and negative Natsumi, it should have been slightly better since that time. The encounter with everyone should have changed those thoughts. From that end, it should have been as fast as a caterpillar running, but she should have advanced forward a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">That, even though.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, shit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi spewed out a sigh in annoyance.</p>
<p class="null-p">The worst thing was that the cause was immediately known.</p>
<p class="null-p">No doubt about it. --Because she remembered it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The root of Natsumi's personality. The ugly personal history sunk in dirty</p>
<p class="null-p">mud--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Natsumi-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Wha--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, as Yoshino's voice echoed, Natsumi felt her shoulders tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--too slow. Just as Natsumi realized that, the rubble of the building destroyed by <Beast>was falling down towards Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami thinly exhaled, focusing her consciousness with <Beast>at the center of her field of vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">Laser spear <Einherjar>on her right hand and the experimental weapon <Yggdraramus>on her left. And also, she had the silver armor <Brünhilde>covering her entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, Origami, as a former AST member and Wizard, was the only girl among them to carry a CR-Unit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, her current fighting ability was by far the best among her peers. The <Yggdraramus>was in everyone's hands. But Origami had a certain pride that only she would be able to sink the blade into <Beast>'s body.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was in fact a common recognition shared among the girls. Although there weren't any particular arrangements made beforehand, everyone had deployed left and right around Origami, forming a formation surrounding <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka, let's go Spirit! Feel the speed of the Yamai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cooperation. There's no avoiding a simultaneous attack from both left and right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru screamed loudly as they launched a pincer attack on <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, attacking while shouting would be considered a useless act, but things were different now.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sisters were attracting <Beast>'s attention by daring to show their presence.</p>
<p class="null-p">10 keys were prepared, and only one of them had to arrive at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aa---aaaaaaaaa--!"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>roared, picking up the ninth sword and pushing it into the ground. The air from there trembled as an invisible wall of 'sound' was formed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nowa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shock. This is--"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sisters couldn't move their feet as their assault was halted. Then, the eighth sword wielded by <Beast>stirred a gust of wind that blew the <Yggdraramus>out of their hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the offense of the girls didn't stop there. Picking off where the Yamai sisters left off, everyone took the opportunity to launch an attack on <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give up nooooow!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Aaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>drew her swords one after the other to handle the girls' attacks, repelling and knocking them down.</p>
<p class="null-p">The keys in everyone's hands of recovering from this desperate situation were being destroyed one after the other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">But--that was fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami calmly observed <Beast>'s movements and quietly kicked up to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The voluntary territory formed by the <Yggdrafolium>and the aftermath of <Beast>angrily swinging her swords. She flew into the tempest of Maryoku and Reiryoku generated from that as if soundless swimming.</p>
<p class="null-p">The decisive moment for this battle as <Beast>pushed back from the other</p>
<p class="null-p">girls' attacks. Origami used the voluntary territory to place the <Yggdraramus>on the tip of her laser spear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Now."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the moment Mukuro rushed in with her <Yggdraramus>, <Beast>'s attention, which had been set up for her surroundings, momentarily shifted. According to Maria's speech, the <Yggdraramus>were modeled after Mukuro's Angel <Michael>. Perhaps because of this, she was the most accustomed at handling it then anyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not like Origami to overlook this chance. Origami manipulated her voluntary territory, thrusting the <Yggdraramus>the moment <Beast>was closing in on Mukuro.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-- "Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami heard a small voice leak out from her throat. The moment the tip of the <Yggdraramus>was about to come into contact with <Beast>, her aim was slightly off.</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't like being repelled by an invisible wall or being blown away by the wind. Rather, it was like her arm had moved against her own will--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Origami noticed. One of the ten Angels carried behind <Beast>'s back, the second sword was drawing brilliant letters onto the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Future description--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami cursed her negligence. Despite hearing that <Beast>had all of their Angels, she ruled out this possibility because of the beast-like manner in which she approached the battlefield.</p>
<p class="null-p">No--even if she did, the results wouldn't have changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Future description. The words written on the omniscient Angel <Rasiel>became reality. Yes. Even the enemy's actions towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, that's right. ……Coming, you are. I wonder why……yes, I thought."</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>muttered in a hurry with hollow eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She grabbed the sixth sword in a hurry and thrusted it into Origami's body, twisting it as if turning a key.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">The CR-Unit Origami was wearing flew out as broken pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if watching the scene of a sakura petal blizzard, Origami sank into the ground.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn…..uh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face frowning from the dull pain, Natsumi slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed she was hit in the head. For a few seconds, her memory became cloudy.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, after blinking her eyes several times, she gradually remembered what happened before losing consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. They were fighting against <Beast>right now. Just when everyone was about to launch a simultaneous attack, rubble suddenly fell on</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm glad……noticed just in……Natsumi……san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Yoshino!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi eyes opened in alarm to the voice she suddenly heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she finally noticed. Yoshino, with blood shed from her forehead, had covered for Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was needless to confirm in order to understand. Yoshino must have protected Natsumi from the falling rubble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi gulped, saying that word as she glanced around.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this wasn't the time to be asking a useless question. She had to call for help in order to treat Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Natsumi and Yoshino couldn't participate, they still had the advantage in numbers. Now should be about the time to peel off the Angels</p>
<p class="null-p">from <Beast>and Shidou to enter a dialogue with her. Then, there must be some free hands around--</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi was looking around and thinking about that, she breathed out in horror.</p>
<p class="null-p">A mountain of rubble spread out to the point that no one would believe it was a cityscape just a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Here and there, the girls collapsed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, on that terrible battlefield, a single girl was slowly walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">--<Beast>. The Spirit, which shouldn't exist in this world, was still carrying all ten swords on her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't……be……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's throat trembled in a daze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, Kurumi, Mukuro, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku, Nia, and even Origami, were all done in without accomplishing anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were leading actors that Natsumi could never compare to. The chosen people selected by God.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, that wasn't all. Perhaps caught in the aftermath of this battle, Shidou also collapsed within this rubble. The occasional groans told her that they were still breathing--but it was clear from whoever was watching that <Beast>would hasten and take measures to end their lives.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to look at her directly in the eyes, Natsumi choked on her breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino's eyes had a strong determination that was incomparable to her injured body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Natsumi-san is the only one that can stop that person. Please. Go-- help Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, she infused all her emotions into speaking each word.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's face turned pale.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Impossible, I can't do it! An opponent everyone was no match for, I can't do anything……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were all better than Natsumi, sharper than Natsumi, stronger than Natsumi.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_22_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">What they couldn't achieve could never be done by her. Natsumi couldn't do it. She shook her head with tears at the ends of her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even after hearing those words from Natsumi, Yoshino only gently smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay……if it's Natsumi-san, you can do it. Natsumi-san, I think has always been a great person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That kind of thing……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, Natsumi-san……Shidou-san is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino was speaking, her eyes suddenly closed as she powerlessly collapsed. The <Yggdraramus>she was holding rolled onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshino……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi rushed to call out her name, but Yoshino didn't reply. Likely, she had reached her limit. She had kept her consciousness solely through willpower.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to confirm that Natsumi was safe. And--to entrust the rest to Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……W-Why, of all things to be me……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi muttered in despair as she looked again to the battlefield.</p>
<p class="null-p">The king of this debris, <Beast>was striding through this land of death. Despite the onslaught of the eight girls, the depths of that power was unfathomable. Surrounding her body with the ten swords like a cage's bars, slowly but surely she was progressing to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without the girls, Shidou was completely defenseless. Eventually as <Beast>arrives, he as a human would be easily slaughtered.</p>
<p class="null-p">The protagonists that could help were all lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only one safe--was Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">When realizing this again, the dreadful palpitations struck Natsumi, with the urge to vomit as if her stomach had turned inside out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her brain was going to burn out from the tension and frustration. Sweat gushed out from her entire body as her limbs trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Why, why did this happen?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was Natsumi, who shouldn't have anything, given such an important role?</p>
<p class="null-p">A stage that was excessively not suitable. A spotlight was suddenly being casted on the supporting character in a supporting role.</p>
<p class="null-p">The desire to escape from this place if that was a choice. Or to crouch down and avoid even letting out a single breath. The actions allowed for Natsumi should have been only that much. That was natural. That was natural for Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment such thoughts began to dominate her head, Natsumi bit her lips. A sharp pain pierced her brain. The taste of blood gradually spread in her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Flee from this spot?</p>
<p class="null-p">Crouch down and hold her breath?</p>
<p class="null-p">Is that much actions allowed for Natsumi?</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Don't, screw around……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a thought unconsciously arose in her head. Such thoughts were naturally smashed and trembled by the heel for Natsumi. --Naturally? When did such rubbish thinking become commonplace for Natsumi?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, ah, it came to light. Everything had come from those memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi gripped on the <Yggdraramus>with a shaking hand.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't remember her father's face</p>
<p class="null-p">--Because he was already gone by the time she became self-aware.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't remember her mother's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Because any look that gave the impression of talking meant getting beaten.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, even now after her memories of being human are remembered, that scene had a defect.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she tried to image a woman that seemed to be her mother, the face portion was crumbled as if painted over with a black sharpie marker.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, but, only the voice she remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mainly a voice yelling in anger, a voice that always rebuked her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman named Kyouno ■■ was always displeased and irritated by Natsumi's existence. At first, she couldn't understand the words uttered, but because of the vehement tone and violence set, she could guess that it wasn't good.</p>
<p class="null-p">She thought that ■■ getting angry was due to her own fault.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, she tried to be as skillful as possible. She learned housework, listened carefully to what was said, and tried to be a good child.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that just made ■■ more displeased. So Natsumi then tried to do as little extra as possible. At most it was evident that she was a powerless insect in front of a storm. Just stick to the bottom of a stone and wait a bit for the weather to calm down. Although there were times of being blown by the wind, it was still somewhat better than facing straight to the forefront.</p>
<p class="null-p">■■ often despised Natsumi as ugly. She didn't know much about ugliness, but she thought it was true because ■■ said it so much.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she were a little cuter, would ■■ love her? When thinking like that, it felt a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="null-p">A wish to have been born more beautiful, but of course she never said that out loud. By that time, Natsumi learned how to go through the lengthy storm.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Nothing existing. Such was an ordinary household that could be found anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was where Natsumi grew up.</p>
<p class="null-p">……The sealed envelope Kotori handed over should have been thin. The documents compiled by <Ratatoskr>contained the minimal data. It didn't mention much about the home environment.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was difficult to imagine that <Ratatoskr>could only get that much information. Likely, Kotori had personally sorted out Natsumi's information. While saying with a threatening attitude, "it's not always pleasant information", a skillful way to dodge the issue, but that is where Kotori fell short.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, Natsumi remembered those days just by looking at her full name. Kotori's concern ended up being wasted. When thinking over it now, that omission may very well have been for Natsumi's sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fundamentally, ■■ never prepared any meals for Natsumi. Her main source of nutrition was the elementary school lunch.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Well, of course that lunch didn't seem paid for either. The homeroom teacher did nothing on principle. Rather than pretending to look into Natsumi's situation; that point wasn't questioned either.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was long vacations like summer and winter vacation. That was a life or death issue for Natsumi. The house had stockpiled on instant noodles and ready-made packaged foodstuff. But she was convinced that she would be killed if she touched that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if she didn't eat anything, the result would end up the same. Natsumi needed to find a way to get calories without ■■ noticing.</p>
<p class="null-p">The conclusion she arrived at was the seasonings. If it was still divided into single meals like cup noodles, no one would mind the seasonings being slightly reduced. During those times, Natsumi was also thankful for ■■'s slovenly personality.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's staple food during the long vacation was sugar and soy sauce diluted with tap water. It was a lucky day if the refrigerator has butter and margarine. The taste of oil and fat permeating on her tongue gave Natsumi a small degree of happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of living like this, Natsumi's physical growth was stunted compared to her peers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Additionally, any attempts at bathing or washing her clothes had to be done when ■■ wasn't looking. Often, she had to go to school looking filthy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Children are geniuses at discovering things that are different. Natsumi, who was 'unlike everyone else', was avoided coming in contact with or even looked upon. In the world of children, the rules were that coming in contact with anything different would mean becoming different as well. One cannot live in a community until proving to friends that you are no different than them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inevitably, Natsumi hated school. To be honest, she wouldn't go there unless she had to.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she had to go there as long as there was lunch. For Natsumi, school was no more than a food supply where she would get the nutrients needed to keep enduring this harsh environment.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then……when did that happen?</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, one day after Natsumi became a junior high student for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">(……Wow. What is this?)</p>
<p class="null-p">As usual, Natsumi arrived home with melancholic steps, knitting her eyebrows while opening the front door.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. The inside of the house had absurdly fallen into ruin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shelves, TV, microwave, had all been flashily pulled and thrown aside. Tableware and glass fragments were scattered on the floor. It looked as if a typhoon had occurred only from within Natsumi's house.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, from the looks of it, Natsumi didn't think it was a hoodlum committing an act of robbery or burglary.</p>
<p class="null-p">■■ from the start had a temper, breaking apart things when stimulated. It seemed she had been dealing with illegal drugs for a while now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, the disastrous condition of the room on that day was as disastrous as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she later learned, apparently on that day ■■ had been contacted about a certain message.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The man who was Natsumi's father had died.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed Natsumi's father had another wife and child. He appeared to have kept paying a large amount of childcare payments, including hush fees, in secret to ■■.</p>
<p class="null-p">In short, ■■ had been notified on that day that her living expenses would be cut off.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that meant, for ■■ it was synonymous with the last meaning of Natsumi's existence disappearing for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">(…………Hey)</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have noticed that Natsumi came home. Couching down on the dresser that was inverted and laid down horizontally, ■■ let out a groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">(…………What?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi replied, lightly tensing her eyebrows in regret in having been discovered. ……Speaking of which, this was the first time in three weeks where she had exchanged words with ■■.</p>
<p class="null-p">(……Money…….bring me.)</p>
<p class="null-p">(……Ha? There must be no such thing.)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Go work no matter what, anything including prostitution to bring money here for me!)</p>
<p class="null-p">While shouting, ■■ threw a nearby glass at her. The sharp edge of the broken glass struck Natsumi's forehead, causing it to bleed.</p>
<p class="null-p">(…………)</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Natsumi kept her hands away from this natural disaster on principle, she couldn't hold back the feeling of unrest in her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wasn't angry at all over her face being hurt. However, this woman, who continued to despise Natsumi as ugly and hideous, was now showing her true intentions while speaking at her own convenience.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What are you talking about? As ugly as I am, there won't be any customers. Sorry that I'm so similar to you.)</p>
<p class="null-p">(…………!)</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't remember well what else was in the conversation they had.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time she noticed, ■■ was on top of Natsumi, strangling her neck with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ka……ah……ha--)</p>
<p class="null-p">A fading voice leaked out from her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her vision was flickering, her consciousness gradually fading. Her face grew hotter and her limbs lost strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm going to be killed. I'm going to be killed. I'm going to be killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's brain was solely controlled by that thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was when.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Hey, you. --Do you want power?)</p>
<p class="null-p">That was when.</p>
<p class="null-p">An unidentifiable mosaic appeared before Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>. The Spirit of Origin. --Takamiya, Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she now knew the true identity behind that, Natsumi at that moment wondered if she was seeing a hallucination due to falling into critical condition.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was fine. Natsumi was frantic in her desperate wish for that power. She clung onto the spider's thread dangling in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">(-----)</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no more voice coming out from her throat--</p>
<p class="null-p">That mosaic sensed Natsumi's feelings and handed her a sparkling gem that glowed green.</p>
<p class="null-p">--After that, the incident probably took no more than 3 full minutes in time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Becoming a Spirit, with the Angel <Haniel>in her hands, Natsumi used that power to transform ■■ into a small frog.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking up, Natsumi tried to raise herself up while having a frantic coughing fit. A frog was bouncing around as if frightened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Small and ridiculous state, more than delight or pity, Natsumi remembered a deep feeling of exhaustion.</p>
<p class="null-p">(…………)</p>
<p class="null-p">--Of course, she raised a leg. But when she tried to crush the frog, her feet stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">As it was, Natsumi straddled onto <Haniel>to pierce through the window glass.</p>
<p class="null-p">(----Ha, haha……)</p>
<p class="null-p">While racing through the sky dyed in the color of the setting sun, Natsumi felt laughter leak out from her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't know what happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something strange suddenly appeared and gave her a strange power.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the problem she thought was helpless was quickly resolved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, even the terrifying ■■, her mother that was so powerful was reduced to such a small existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ahahahaha……hahahahahahahahahaha!)</p>
<p class="null-p">With that in mind, her laughter grew steadier.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why couldn't it have been that easy until now?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did she stay with such a mother until now?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did she until now--</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ah……aaah……aaaaaaaaaaaah------!)</p>
<p class="null-p">--The laughter echoing in the heavens changed into a tearful lament.</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew it was the first time getting revenge for herself who was always oppressed until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't want to get revenge--</p>
<p class="null-p">--I just wanted you to love me.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Da……mn……it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi shouted as if vomiting out, slamming her head against the nearby rubble.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her head that was already injured began to hurt even more. A spill of dizziness struck her, with blood bleeding from her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that became good encouragement.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi took in rough breaths while gritting her teeth, and then kicked off the ground after resolving herself.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit, called by humans under the name <Beast>, was moving forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">The grey cloudy field of vision reflected the ground piled up with garbage and dust.</p>
<p class="null-p">And--in the center of that, there was appearance of a boy crouching and about to collapse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah……gu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">His breath was faint and it was currently painful to raise his voice. His clothes were torn, and there were many painful scars on his exposed skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps even if left alone, he would soon expire.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's……o……kay……don't be scared…….good. We are……not…… enemies……"</p>
<p class="null-p">All of his friends had fallen.</p>
<p class="null-p">And his body was inflicted with enough wounds to the point of dying.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the words the boy spoke out didn't change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Shut up……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's eyebrows tensed as she groaned.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder why? The voice of this boy who was supposed to be dead was strangely hurting her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time this boy spoke. Each time he made an appeal to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was driven by an urge to scratch away at her ears, head, and throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Likely it was some sort of mental attack. There couldn't be any human standing in front of her without any help. Hurry up and kill. Hurry up and erase. Hurry up and eliminate soon. If she kept hearing this human's voice, her head was going to get even more lost.</p>
<p class="null-p">But there were some subtle questions in her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now, there had been several opportunities to stab this boy. But when the chance presented itself, for some reason her hand hesitated to swing down at his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same goes for this situation in the first place. She traced his remaining scent and used the key sword to open a 'hole' in space. It was as if--she went to see him again.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know. I don't understand my actions. Why did she care so much about this boy? I am--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……So……don't……look so sad……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The words of a boy who disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">She involuntarily choked.</p>
<p class="null-p">A strange throbbing. Severe pain as if having been pierced through the heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Not good. Not good. This is dangerous. This would turn her into something that she wasn't. I have to kill. I have to erase this. I have to destroy this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Disa……ppear--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">--Then</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very moment she was about to swing this sword to kill this boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aimed at her from the sky, the light of condensed Maryoku was fired.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the scene happening right in front of him, Shidou involuntarily choked.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>had soundly defeated the girls and was making her way to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the sky, a dazzling light fell like downpour.</p>
<p class="null-p">One second later, he noticed a shining 'leaf' floating above <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">--<Yggdrafolium>. The all-purposeful weapon that the aerial warship was proud of.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, even after noticing that, Shidou's astonishment didn't fade.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. All of the girls that could have handled the <Yggdrafolium>should have already been taken down by <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Had anyone recovered? Had <Fraxinus>been restored? Or--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Impudent……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was thinking that over, <Beast>raised the fourth sword. At that moment, the surrounding temperature dropped drastically as an ice wall formed above her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The light of the Maryoku emitted from the <Yggdrafolium>was blocked by <Beast>'s ice wall, scattering the aftermath onto the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the one manipulating this <Yggdrafolium>knew 100% that this attack wouldn't be enough for <Beast>. The moment <Beast>raised a single hand to repel the ray of light; a small shadow appeared behind her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Uh……haaaaaaaaah--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With disheveled and ruffled hair, the girl attacked <Beast>with a branch-like dagger. Recognizing her appearance, Shidou widened his eyes unintentionally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's arrival, the charge forward of the person who had disappeared when they first all rushed to attack <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, it was only for a moment where <Beast>'s attention was diverted to the sky. She already seemed to be aware that Natsumi was approaching from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Get lost."</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>said in a cold voice, holding onto the eighth sword in her left hand and swinging it towards Natsumi. Flying alongside the trajectory of the vacuum blade--Natsumi's head was sent flying very easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha--"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that sight, Shidou immediately screamed--but then he immediately reconsidered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite how much she was cornered, he didn't think Natsumi would embark on such reckless methods.</p>
<p class="null-p">Uhh negative, pessimistic, and lacking in confidence --Natsumi would be excessively cautious, never charging in against such a strong enemy without a plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why Shidou was able to immediately notice this discomfort.</p>
<p class="null-p">--From the neck of the Natsumi that had been decapitated, there wasn't any blood flowing out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to match Shidou's voice, Natsumi's head trembled like a block of noise, disappearing as it dissolved in the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then Shidou finally understood. --The appearance of this Natsumi was a dummy image created by the voluntary territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">The voluntary territory surrounded the <Yggdrafolium>projected the will of the operator onto reality. Complex operations may take some time to get used to, but Natsumi was originally the Spirit who wielded the mirror Angel <Haniel>. Manipulating the refraction of light to create a virtual image did seem like her strong point.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the fact that this Natsumi was a virtual image meant that the real Natsumi</p>
<p class="null-p">was-- "----"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment as Shidou was thinking about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like taking off the veil with a pattern that blended into the landscape.</p>
<p class="null-p">A small figure appeared in front of <Beast>'s heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a virtual image, there was no futile scream or even the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p class="null-p">No sound, no voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like an assassin in the dark, Natsumi quietly--thrusted the <Yggdraramus>at <Beast>'s chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi choked as the feeling was transmitted to both of her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Hitting with everything she could do right now. Using the bombardment of the <Yggdrafolium>as a decoy, distract her attention with virtual images created by the voluntary territory, and then using that pause to step in for the certain kill.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>could roughly be divided into two methods. One was slashing away with that 'claw'. The other was a special attack using the 'sword'. The latter is further divided into 10 patterns.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was impossible to deal with them all. However, to use the power of the sword, she seemed to have to be able to hold it during use.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, up to two 'swords' can be used at a given time. So if she could create a state where both of them were used up in a single moment, a chance opportunity could be created in a fraction of that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the number one person in being a have not, this was a cowardly, shameless, and sly tactic. However, Natsumi didn't hesitate to play this hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, no insult could hurt her. The sense of shame had already been exhausted. If it meant saving everyone's lives, being slandered as a coward would be little more than an itch.</p>
<p class="null-p">--However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Quietly--</p>
<p class="null-p">Without even frowning, <Beast>looked down at Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, the <Yggdraramus>blade brought out by Natsumi didn't even reach <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Just before <Beast>'s chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there, a small 'hole' opened that swallowed the <Yggdraramus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The sixth sword. <Beast>was holding the handle of the key sword that could open a hole in space.</p>
<p class="null-p">Monster. That one word robbed her thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely different from Natsumi, she was an overwhelming monster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Ah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this sight, Natsumi took in a small breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the voice she once heard was again echoing in her head. (……Hey, it was useless. You couldn't do anything at all.)</p>
<p class="null-p">--Shut up.</p>
<p class="null-p">(So as it is give up and die. What have you accomplished? What changed about you?)</p>
<p class="null-p">--Shut up.</p>
<p class="null-p">(A dullard who rides on the coattails of others. You can't do it. You're weak. You'll never be loved for the rest of your life.)</p>
<p class="null-p">--Shut……up……!</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite her heart desperately trying to resist, those words entangled Natsumi's limbs just like an iron chain.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not over yet. She still had her hands ready. Despite knowing that in her head, her body wouldn't move. She had to take the next move, but ■■'s shadow caught Natsumi and wouldn't let her go.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, <Beast>narrowed her eyes onto Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">An act done as if to signal the end for Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">--But, it was at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Na……tsumi……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a cry marked with anguish, the sound came from steps treading past the rubble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Shidou--!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi felt her throat being tightly squeezed. But that wasn't surprising. After all, full of wounds, Shidou was standing on that spot while bleeding from his entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was clear to even the untrained eye that he was in state where he shouldn't be able to move. Close to death from bleeding out of the bruises and lacerations all over his body, this was almost suicide.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shidou stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">For what reason?</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't even need to think about it. He knew how pessimistic Natsumi was.</p>
<p class="null-p">--In order to help Natsumi.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_22_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"……Where are you going? Isn't your target me? Now, come on honey. I'll hug you gently."</p>
<p class="null-p">It should be difficult for him to even speak, but Shidou fearlessly smiled while deliberately provoking <Beast>. <Beast>twitched her eyebrows while staring at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--tsumi. Natsumi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Eh--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, a small voice arrived at her ear. It seemed Shidou was whispering through the intercom so that <Beast>wouldn't notice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Knowing you, do you still have something prepared? I'll draw her attention. Do it with all your strength."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I understand. Because of our long relationship. It's fine……you can do</p>
<p class="null-p">it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah……ah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Natsumi gradually felt tears oozing out from both her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Does anyone love you?</p>
<p class="null-p">She was ashamed that such thoughts were in her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was she thinking?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even on the verge of dying, there was a man here who would stand up for Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing at the edge of this desperate situation, even then so many friends believed in Natsumi and entrusted their lives to Natsumi……! "Uh……ooh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Natsumi issued a command to the <Yggdrafolium>through her headset.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, <Beast>had a look of shock for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't surprising.</p>
<p class="null-p">In any case, right now on <Beast>'s back a <Yggdraramus>was deeply trusted, standing in place of the headless virtual image of Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Slipping into the virtual image, another <Yggdraramus>was fired.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there was only one <Yggdraramus>per person. As long as Natsumi was the one holding onto it, such an attack couldn't be realized.</p>
<p class="null-p">But in Natsumi's hands there was another <Yggdraramus>which harbored the original owner's regrets.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes--it was Yoshino's dagger, the person who had to leave the frontlines after saving Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Being so long-winded and meaningless in a person's head for how long? It's time to shut up you damn ghost."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's throat quivered as if roaring as she operated the voluntary territory through the headset. With invisible hands, she gripped on the handle of the <Yggdraramus>protruding from <Beast>'s back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can……do this."</p>
<p class="null-p">And while muttering, she placed her strength into her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I……am strong."</p>
<p class="null-p">Strong, strong, she kept telling herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was already no hesitation in that voice. The rationale for those words was already given.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not just Shidou. Yoshino as well. Kotori as well. Nia as well. Origami as well. Kaguya as well. Yuzuru as well. Mukuro as well. Kurumi as well. Miku as well. And despite being gone, Tohka as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone had acknowledged Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">They said she could stay here.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Natsumi once wished and yearned for--but they gave me what she couldn't obtain for herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi--is loved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am……cute……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, the opponent was powerful. The only mysterious Spirit left in the world. That single word held tremendous power.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi was exceedingly meager in comparison with only using a borrowed weapon. The rest could be easily fostered through looking at their different expressions. Any observation indicating otherwise would be considered abnormal.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that didn't mean she could give up.</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't let everyone that loved her be killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Everyone……I--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice broke off from that moment. This was an excessively arrogant and irrelevant remark.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she reconsidered immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Placing in her determination into her words, she released it like a bullet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will protect you……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi placed her strength in her hands--twisting the dagger thrusted into <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 8: Kazamachi Yamai</p>
<p class="null-p">--Remembering that which is buried in the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gemini shinning in the night sky, no one is aware of its origin. The same is true for Yamai.</p>
<p class="null-p">But don't blame those who search for the darkness. As expected of mankind's karma. But when people are looking into the abyss, they are staring into the abyss……</p>
<p class="null-p">……Hmm? Huh? That's not quite it? Well, whatever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Uhh, what was I talking about? Ah, that's right. That matter with Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yup, I'm grateful to Shidou. Thanks to Shidou, Yuzuru and I were able to stay together.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, I wanted Yuzuru to survive even at the expense of myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">When it comes to a situation like that now, surely I think many would consider the same thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">But now--I can say that was mistaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I am convince that the most difficult thing for Yuzuru is parting ways with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a bit itchy to say that with self-awareness, but it can't be helped because it is true.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because we always struggled, thinking of dying. But then a path for both of us to survive appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because we can always increase the amount of choices--that's what Shidou taught me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Recollection. For some reason recently, the old days are being recalled.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it's not the story of when I was human. Unfortunately, there is only one certainty for the memories of that time--everything vague except for one point of originally being one with Kaguya.</p>
<p class="null-p">Competing with Kaguya, that's when I met Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, I was desperate for Kaguya to survive, but now it is a fun memory. That's strange. Time seems to have the effect of improving memories. Any difficult memory, once passed, becomes an experience. Rather, the more one struggles, the deeper impression it has in the heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, that only works if it is peaceful now. No matter how severe the journey or painful the path, everything feels precious if you think it was necessary to shape this current world.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why I think this. Even if I recall the memories of when Yuzuru and Kaguya were human. And--no matter what tribulations or hardship it was. Yuzuru and Kaguya can recall it with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Whatever the future, if it's me and Yuzuru-- Conviction. Yuzuru and Kaguya--</p>
<p class="null-p">--Can easily break through.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Will break through it easily.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Kefu, kefu……, ……Yuzuru, are you alive?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Response. Some, how……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru, who were lying side by side on the mountain of rubble, both woke up and unsteadily stood up at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them were full of wounds. After looking at each other, both of them laughed in a self-mocking manner, glancing to check their surroundings while supporting each other's aching bodies.</p>
<p class="null-p">……How long have they lost consciousness for? The last sight both of them saw before fainting was setting up their <Yggdraramus>and charging at</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>. It appeared both of them had been tragically dispatched by <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that was expected. Of course, Kaguya and Yuzuru served as decoys for the blow most likely to obtain victory. Even if it was flashy, it would have been nice if they could have distracted <Beast>for just a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, the Yamai sisters hated losing. It would be lying if they said there weren't any regrets. But if anyone could reach <Beast>there, among them all it would be Origami with her CR-Unit.</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't a battle for merit, but rather a battle to save <Beast>. A battle to pave the way for Shidou to her. It wasn't necessary for Kaguya and Yuzuru to receive first-class merit if it meant that goal being reached.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the surrounding scenery wasn't what they expected at all. --A mountain of rubble spreading endlessly. Nothing had changed since Kaguya and Yuzuru had fainted.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ideal would have been for all of this to be settled by the time they were unconscious and to wake up in the medical facility in <Fraxinus>or <Ratatoskr>--but that seemed too far off.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it would have been impossible for that Origami to not do anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely at this very moment--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shudder. No way……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru noticed over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Scattered around the surroundings, there was the appearance of girls painfully groaning just like them.</p>
<p class="null-p">And among that, there was the appearance of Origami stripped of her silver CR-Unit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……! O-Origami!? It can't be……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shock. No way, master Origami……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two choked on their breath and unintentionally closed their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was arguably the strongest of the girls. Her defeat was synonymous with the loss of anyone who could protect Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Nuorya!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Invigorate. Nun……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment after recognizing that, Kaguya and Yuzuru clenched their teeth and stood up from the spot. Of course, the severe pain ran throughout their bodies, but such things were held down by their fighting spirit. In extreme cases, even if a limb was broken, as long as they were still alive it could be reconnected with a medical realizer later.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. --As long as they were alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dying meant being beyond recovery. Even with the power of a Wizard transcending human wisdom. Even for--the strongest Spirit of Origin. That result couldn't be reversed.</p>
<p class="null-p">So as soon as possible, they had to confirm Shidou and the others' safety. Of course, in the worst case scenario, the damages sustained meant that <Fraxinus>could only silently observe. That may very well be the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless until they confirmed everyone safety with their own eyes--</p>
<p class="null-p">Then</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Dumbfounded. This is."</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, both of them widened their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't surprising.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, a huge pillar of light rose from the ground and into the night sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh……ku, ah, a, a, aaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">--<Beast>'s scream caused the surrounding air to rattle and tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was staring stunned at the violent spectacle.</p>
<p class="null-p">The <Yggdraramus>dagger that Natsumi fired, the moment that body was penetrated by that distorted blade, <Beast>--or to be precise, the ten swords behind her began emitting light.</p>
<p class="null-p">That dazzling radiance, as if pulsating, increased in intensity. Eventually, after making a crackling sound, the aftermath of the Reiryoku was dispersed into the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa……waaa……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi, being the one closest to <Beast>, was the one most panicking being exposed to this sight. As <Beast>'s body suddenly began to glow, her body cowered on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi! It's dangerous! Get away from there!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Y-Yeah……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou shouted, Natsumi hurriedly left. The light of the Reiryoku violently exploded at where Natsumi was just at a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gya! T-That was close!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Somehow……but this is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Well done, cute Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Maria's voice from the intercom that had responded. Natsumi's face twitched as she heard the adjective attached to her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Confirming activation of <Yggdraramus>. Temporarily separating Angels from <Beast>. As expected of Natsumi. A capable child. A strong child. A cute child."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stooooop--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Maria had said, Natsumi twisted her body while clutching her head. Rather than being glad to be recognized for her achievement, she was writhing as if a painful black history had been dug up.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Somehow, she seemed like a completely different person. Shidou smiled wryly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Please don't tease her too much. It needs to be recognized that she did so with great pains all by herself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My intentions were to praise her. --Well, that's fine. Compared to that, it's coming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Guh, uh, ah, oh, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa------------!!" <Beast>let out a remarkably loud roar--from that body, an enormous amount of light burst towards the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene was exactly like a spire soaring into the sky. Or it was reminiscent of a huge sword--thrusting and tearing through the evening night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What--"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this sudden scene, Shidou and Natsumi opened their eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately following that movement, the top of the pillars of light glistened like stars--</p>
<p class="null-p">From there, many shootings star began descending towards the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What, wait, something is flying this way……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Natsumi who was looking up at the sky screamed loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right. Countless clusters of light were pouring down from the sky. One of them came down towards Shidou and Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha--"</p>
<p class="null-p">But they involuntarily cowered, even if trying to escape, it was too late. Shidou and Natsumi's sight was blinded by the bright light.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, uwagyaaaaaaaaa----!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no shock wave as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead-- "Huh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's dumbfounded voice echoed around.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a beat, Shidou noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Natsumi who fallen to her backside, a short sword was sticking down there on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi whispered quietly, staring intently at that sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">A curved sword as if it was pursuing sharpness rather than destructive power. An emerald green gem was sparkling in the center. The shape, composed of graceful curves, somewhat resembled as witch's hat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sword looked familiar. --One of the ten swords <Beast>was carrying behind her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, a faint light began to grow in the eastern sky, as if the shooting stars had call upon the morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">While bathing in the light of dawn, Shidou raised his head to look around. --Following the direction on the grounds where those shooting stars had landed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, he immediately understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each shooting star had reached the position where they should be.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Origami, there was the first sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Nia, there was the second sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Kurumi, there was the third sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Yoshino, there was the fourth sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Kotori, there was the fifth sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Mukuro, there was the sixth sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Natsumi, there was the seventh sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Kaguya and Yuzuru, there was the eighth sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Miku, there was the ninth sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Each sword was stabbed into the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This, is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha--……amazing……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara. Really--what a nostalgic feeling."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls unsteadily stood up, staring at the swords that descended in front of them. Even Yoshino and Origami, who had fainted, raised their faces with a groan as if shaken by the Reiryoku coming from the swords.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh, uh……you, bastard, damn……"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to that, <Beast>who had lost the swords, struggled to squeeze out every word from her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't miss this opportunity. Shidou raised his voice in order to reach everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, the swords!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ooh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Responding to Shidou's call, the girls reached out their hands, grabbing the hilt of the swords in front of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, at that very moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the crumbling mountain with no life left, countless Reiryoku lights swirled--</p>
<p class="null-p">Like giant flowers racing to bloom in full glory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Starting from the handle held by the girls, the iron-colored swords gradually assumed brilliant colors.</p>
<p class="null-p">And soon, the swords transformed along with that light.</p>
<p class="null-p">Into countless feathers. Into a magnificent book. Into a clock with guns. Into a huge rabbit. Into a fiery battle axe. Into a key-shaped khakkhara. Into a broom furnished with a mirror. Into a shining musical instrument.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right. The Angels that should have vanished with the disappearance of the Spirit of Origin had now reappeared once more on the surface.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! <Zadkiel>--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way, our Angels really came back……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……in that case, we can fight."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls--the Spirits controlled their Angels, the Reiryoku wrapped around their bodies, as if a nostalgic feeling, and formed different clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Astral Dress. The absolute stronghold that protected the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">The glorious sight of the girls lining up was just like the scene from one year ago. Shidou felt a strange feeling filling up his chest as he clenched his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, a warm light enveloped his body. Shidou widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking to the side, he saw Natsumi standing up there and raising up <Haniel>. At the same time, the wounds etched in Shidou's body completely closed up like a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I was worried since it's been a while, but surprisingly I still remember it. For now, it's just first aid. As usual, I only cleaned up the damaged parts. Don't be too reckless."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I feel much better. Thank you, Natsumi. I'm glad you're here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Hm."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Shidou closed and opened his hand as if he was checking on the condition of his wounds. Natsumi turned away like she was embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">While it was a gentle response, it was proof that Natsumi received Shidou's honest praise. Shidou felt somewhat happy over this as he loosened his cheeks. Then, perhaps noticing this, Natsumi had her cheeks blush even redder.</p>
<p class="null-p">Overlooking that scene, Kotori smiled wryly. After that, she cleared her throat to regain her state of mind and shouted to lead everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now--"</p>
<p class="null-p">With an Astral Dress that resembled a kimono, horns that were just like an oni, Kotori pointed her flaming axe towards <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--From here on out, this will be our war (date)."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that command--</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits danced in the dawn-lit sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the field of rubble bathed in the morning glow, several lights shined.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the shine of the Reiryoku emitted by the girls wielding Angels. Created by gathering all of the world's mana. A supernatural crystal. A 'miraculous form' that transcended human wisdom.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls, dressed in their Astral Dress for the first time in a year, manipulated their Angels with exquisite control as if no blank time had occurred. One by one, they surrounded <Beast>in the process.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, bastards. What did you do……to me……"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>, having had her swords stolen, turned her rag-like cloak and swung with the 'claw' in her right hand. Sharps slashes that scrapped away at space itself attacked the girls.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_22_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Nuha!? Didn't it take a debuff? It's still really strong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Certainly, the Angels have been temporarily plundered, but the original power is too different. Rather than weakening, consider it narrowing down her attack options. Don't let your guard down and cooperate to suppress this opponent!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Ooh."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits all responded to Kotori's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-- "…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In such a battlefield, two shadows were silently looking at this illusory spectacle.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Yamai Kaguya and Yamai Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">Twin sisters that usually took the lead in front of everyone and competed for being the best, for some reason they didn't grab the handle of the sword in front of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">The eighth sword <Beast>had carried on her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">The slender sword that held a spiral design.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite its shape, the sword was reminiscent of the Angel of wind <Raphael>once used by Kaguya and Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, by picking that up, the power of the Spirits would return just like it did for everyone else. In that manner, it must be a way to help Shidou. There was no need for hesitation. But--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Yuzuru."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru called out each other's name while exchanging glances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Smile. Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because their timing was shared, both of them unintentionally laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, coincidentally they remembered again.</p>
<p class="null-p">About a month before now, the event that caused this hesitation--</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">--What I remember is the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The sky. The blue sky. Without a single cloud--not recognizing until now, but it was a breathtaking sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the appearance of the birds crossing it seemed strangely beautiful; I unintentionally reach out my hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">No--I tried to reach out my hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually, my hands were out of sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">I just couldn't stretch it to the heavens, or they couldn't move at all……or perhaps my arms are already gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although thoughts were clear, bodily sensations were strangely vague. Like something appearing in a science fiction work, a human that had been reduced to a brain and spine submerged in a water tank. Perhaps the feeling was like that. And then, even these effortless thoughts floated and faded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, perhaps it might have been better to be grateful for this lack of physical sensation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, if that had remained clear, I couldn't even be able to think like this right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day should have been nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time I got up in the morning was no different than usual. I painted my toast with half butter and half homemade strawberry jam like usual. This was done four times. Butter two times and strawberry jam two times. That combination was important. While putting emphasis on this, my mother would praise me by telling me to, "Hurry up and go to school soon".</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I took to school with an infinitely light school bag, and Fender Stratford bought with money from a part-time job (as well as pocket change borrowed from her parents in advance), taking her classes (ymmv) seriously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lunch is purchased bread as usual. Always competing with each other with Maya's two sets, it was slightly less than her preference of five sets, the popular cutlet sandwich and custard melon bread, and also getting the splendid sausage mayo roll and chocolate Danish. Chewing at the leftovers with tears in her eyes, the bread she ate while eating with those two always had an exceptional taste.</p>
<p class="null-p">After school, finding out that her friends decided that the song played at the next school festival will be Kana and Batori (guilty of coughing out lol at this song recommended), helping a woman on the bus, stopped by a fashion research institute where asked to be a model, talking with her classmate Mieri about love (But the love she boasted about was borderline masochistic. At the end it was concluded with, "Yamai should hurry up and get a boyfriend soon". It seemed she was not interested in longevity), and going back home after accepting a challenge.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such was a page of the everyday life that has been repeated over 100 times now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, a fun day. It was a day that was impossible to not make a fuss. After 10 or 20 years, it may be suitable to look back on how good she had it during this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if forced to say what happened differently--</p>
<p class="null-p">While on the way home, a child jumped in front of moving car while chasing after a ball……what a manga-like sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">……No, no, not at all. I did something cool. Quite like a hero always longed for in the olden days.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sure I would have gotten a certificate from the police and be given a three-sided article in a local newspaper. They may have wanted to introduce me in front of all of the students during the morning assembly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, but this injury is quite troublesome. The school festival is near. Without me, the performance would be put on hold. And also being the supporting member for the sports club. And--</p>
<p class="null-p">With that thought in mind, my consciousness finally became hazy and I realized my own condition.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I probably always knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">I understood and pretended to be unaware.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm here. I still want to do something. I want to travel. I want to eat more delicious things. Best of all, I haven't even had a boyfriend yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right. I am--</p>
<p class="null-p">Kazamachi Yamai died at this time.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">February. Spirit mansion room 808. The room where the Yamai sisters lived together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru, having read the information from within the envelope, silently sat on the sofa. This was a rare sight for the Yamai sisters, who would otherwise always be talking except during sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that wasn't unreasonable.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, that information contained a fact that they didn't expect.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Kazamachi Yamai, you mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">How long did the silence last for? Kaguya whispered as if she couldn't endure this quietness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Consent. It appears so. That's surprising."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh……yeah, well, the name is pretty cool……I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Smile. Is it then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Kaguya, Yuzuru lightly laughed. In response to that, Kaguya shrugged her shoulders and smiled unclearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment of seeing those envelopes in front of them, Kaguya and Yuzuru picked theirs up faster than anyone else--but as expected this wasn't even considered.</p>
<p class="null-p">It couldn't be that the information of the person described would be for only one person.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, to be exact, there certainly was the feeling of a strange memory before.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It's said that Kaguya and Yuzuru were originally one and split into two.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed the numerous battles before meeting Shidou were nothing more than fights to determine the main personality of when the two became one again.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, after the fact that all Spirit besides Mio and Tohka were originally humans, their minds changed a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. They didn't know if they were born from Reiryoku just like Mio and Tohka. Normally, it wouldn't be possible to even imagine a single human splitting into two.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, Kaguya and Yuzuru felt that the "originally one idea" came from an effect of the Sephira Crystal given to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, they thought that two separate Sephira Crystals were given to twin sisters, so the idea that they were originally identical was planted.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, before they opened the envelope.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm absolutely the older sister!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Negative. Yuzuru is the older sister. The proof is mainly over here. Fufuni."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't rub someone else's breasts like its natural! Jeez……if I'm the older sister, I hope you'll call me 'Kaguya ane-sama'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Resolution. When Yuzuru is declared the older sister, I'll call you 'Yuzuru Onee-chan sama's favorite cool and gentle Kaguya'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't there too many adjectives there!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, going above a carefree quarrel, both of them wagered tomorrow's snacks on who would be the older sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Well, to be precise, this hypothesis that was raised, was suggested by Origami during a discussion with the two. Kaguya and Yuzuru who heard that said, "Hoho……ah, no, just like I thought." "Praise. As expected of master Origami", and gave those remarks as their replies</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the information <Ratatoskr>'s documents only contained information about a single girl named 'Kazamachi Yamai'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya scratched her head while being confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Anyway, what does this mean? Are we originally a human that split up like slimes? Uh, are we really human? Isn't that more monster-like than a Spirit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Details. According to <Ratatoskr>'s comments, the current situation is similar to……vanishing twin syndrome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Vanishing twin……? That sounds a bit cool. Like some sort of technique that can erase an opponent's attack."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explanation. For one pregnant with twins, one of them didn't wasn't nourished well, so it's a phenomenon where that one is absorbed into the mother's womb or by the other fetus. So in a more concise way, Kazamachi Yamai is 'a human that should have been born as twins'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Twins……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru looked at the document again.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Kazamachi Yamai. 17 years at the time. Born on October 18th.</p>
<p class="null-p">One day coming home from school, an accident was recorded of her protecting a child. Likely that was the moment she was turned into a Spirit by <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, as it was helping Kazamachi Yamai who had her vitals in a perilous state --an existence lurking within, did another human factor respond to the Sephira Crystal?</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what was written on the document.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Uhh, are there any more documents?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Verification. That's right, the rest is--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Yuzuru found a small envelope from within the bundle of documents.</p>
<p class="null-p">The envelope had the words 'Photo/Kazamachi Yamai' written on the surface.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon seeing this, Kaguya and Yuzuru became silent again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's Yuzuru."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Address. It's Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them let out a voice that came from nowhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……wha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. What does Kaguya mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them had made a concession to the other. But, as it was, this didn't help make any progress. Both of them also then made the decision to clear their throats with a cough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No……I mean, speaking of which, we haven't had lunch today. Let's take a break after some lunch. Pick this up again in two hours……how about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Coincidence. Yuzuru was thinking the same as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru glanced at each other for a moment, giving out forced laughter while both standing up at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haah."</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the spirit mansion and walking for a while, Kaguya let out a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had set a break for lunch, but she wasn't hungry. ……No, this morning she only had toast with strawberry jam and a salad. Perhaps her appetite was gone, but she didn't feel hungry at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was needless to ask why. --It was about Kazamachi Yamai.</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't say it in front of Yuzuru……but after reading those documents, the memories of Kazamachi Yamai was revived in Kaguya's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, she remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her history. Her thoughts. Her--last moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">What did this mean? Kaguya, suddenly left confused, had no choice but to stand up for this adequate reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The reason why she and Yuzuru were divided into two was because of another human factor in Kazamachi Yamai.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, could it be said that one of them was the original Kazamachi Yamai and the other was the twin sister of Kazamachi Yamai that didn't exist originally?</p>
<p class="null-p">And since the memories of Kazamachi Yamai were revived in Kaguya--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, really."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya shook her head to wipe away these gloomy thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">No good. No good. Worried about this point alone meant just having a bad imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, there was only one place to go for a case like this. Kaguya raised her face and accelerated her pace, taking the course to her destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">And--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Reflecting. Mm."</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the spirit mansion and walking for a while, Yuzuru let out a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had set a break for lunch, but she wasn't hungry at all. ……No, this morning she only had toast with butter and salad. Perhaps her appetite was gone, but she wasn't hungry at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was needless to ask why. --It was about Kazamachi Yamai.</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't say it in front of Kaguya……but after reading those documents, the memories of Kazamachi Yamai was revived in Yuzuru's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, she remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her history. Her thoughts. Her--last moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">What did this mean? Yuzuru, suddenly left confused, had no choice but to stand up for this adequate reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The reason why she and Kaguya were divided into two was because of another human factor in Kazamachi Yamai.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, could it be said that one of them was the original Kazamachi Yamai and the other was twin sister of Kazamachi Yamai that didn't exist originally?</p>
<p class="null-p">And since the memories of Kazamachi Yamai were revived in Yuzuru--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Self-defense. Don't think this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru shook her head to wipe away these gloomy thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">No good. No good. Worried about this point alone meant just having a bad imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, there was only one place to go for a case like this. Yuzuru raised her face and accelerated her pace, taking the course to her destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-- "----Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Surprise. This is."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru widened their eyes after discovering each other at the exact same spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The two of them, having parted ways to walk around the Spirit mansion, had ended up coming to the same place at exactly the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was--located right next to the mansion, the Itsuka household.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">They stared at each other stunned for a brief while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu, haha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wry smile. Fu, fufu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Laughter began to emerge from out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was nothing whatsoever. Both Kaguya and Yuzuru felt that the best way of dealing with this worry--was to come here and be heard by Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">As this laughter was noticed, the entrance to the Itsuka opened and Shidou came out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……? What's the matter, the both of you. In front of the house."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……sorry, sorry. I just wanted a little consultation with Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. Can you listen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consultation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slanted his head curiously, but he invited Kaguya and Yuzuru into the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what is this consultation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickly brew some tea to serve in front of them. Kaguya and Yuzuru looked to each other, trying to say those words under a small groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm……I mean, if hypothetical……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. What would Shidou do is someone said you are a fake?" "………Ha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing their question, Shidou looked at them while confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does that mean? Fake……? Is this supposed to be a physiological test?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm, well, something like that. What do you think? One day, someone with the exact same face as myself emerged."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Declaration. 'I've be placed under so much difficulty until now, I'm the real one', what if that is stated?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is this about Shinji?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou asked that question while placing his hand against his chin. In response, Kaguya and Yuzuru let out a collective "ah' sound while widening their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shinji was the name of the existence before becoming Shidou. Kaguya and Yuzuru had no intention of brining that up, but certainly it would be reasonable for Shidou to think about that while listening to a question like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">'S-Sorry. I didn't mean that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apology. Apologizes for making you hear that. Both of us had no intention for any insult."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kaguya and Yuzuru spoke out in a hurry, Shidou shook his shoulders while loosening his expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need to apologize, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then after saying that, he replied back after thinking it over for a few moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What is a fake?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. A matter of the heart?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I mean, aren't I living a different life from 'that real Shidou'? I've met different people, talked differently, ate differently. ……Then that isn't a fake anymore, isn't it just another real thing? --At least I think so regarding me and Shinji."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Shidou said, Kaguya and Yuzuru looked at each other--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu……hehehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Smile. That's certainly true."</p>
<p class="null-p">The anticipated reply caused them both to broadly laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Ah, as expected, it was good to have come here.</p>
<p class="null-p">A warm feeling filled their hearts as Kaguya and Yuzuru gradually smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely the answer had already been with Kaguya and Yuzuru all along. If they had considered the other to be Kazamachi Yamai, they would have arrived at this answer sooner. Even if they were the one that couldn't be born, it didn't matter to their current selves.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that compassion heart gave birth to hesitation. Kaguya and Yuzuru, both were worried that the other would be shocked at her origin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking it over now, why were they brooding over this so much?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru both thought about that at the same time. And for some reason, they were convinced that the other was thinking the same thing. Certainly, Kaguya and Yuzuru may have a slightly special background compared to the other girls that turned from humans to Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what about it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, it was so much fun to be together.</p>
<p class="null-p">The competition between them was so exciting.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be saved by having each other's existence--</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them kept laughing for a while in front of a confused Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">--Yes. Since that time, their resolution had been decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hand stopped for a moment. The power of the Angel that should have been lost was in front of their eyes. Likely, that sparked some confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">The power of the Spirits can change shape depending on one's heart. If the memory of Kazamachi Yamai held true, then both thought that taking in that Reiryoku would lead to some transformation for the both of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--what is there to be afraid of now?</p>
<p class="null-p">If she was with Kaguya.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she was with Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Then together, they will be the strongest.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this glimmering battlefield, Kaguya and Yuzuru smiled at each other and reached their hands out simultaneously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go, Yuzuru."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Let's go, Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">And while saying that, with each other's hand, they grabbed the handle of the spiral sword protruding in front of them.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_22_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment, from the point where they touched, the ripples spread on the surface of the sword, suddenly changing its shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Kaguya and Yuzuru both felt a nostalgic feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like warm blood that flowed into a cold body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like something from the depths of their core had woken up.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Lost wings that had returned once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuzuru--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">With their connected hands as the starting point, there was the feeling of the boundary between their bodies becoming ambiguous.</p>
<p class="null-p">But they weren't afraid. Rather, it was harder to suppress the exhilaration that came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru brought their faces closer to each other from both sides.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">And their lips touched each other.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a roar of anger, a number of slashes were released.</p>
<p class="null-p">The 'claw' that furnished <Beast>'s five fingers indiscriminately and roughly tore apart the air and ground to attack the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……! How powerful is this girl……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In one way or another, she was using <Camael>to repel away these slashes infused with tremendous power. Kotori involuntarily frowned at the heavy impact being transmitted to her arm.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>, who should have had her swords taken by the <Yggdraramus>, was more or less fighting equally against Kotori and the others as the battle unfolded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to when she was swinging those swords, she was no longer opening a 'hole' in space or releasing ice and fire.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, <Beast>still had a 'claw' that can cut anything it touches and paranormal strength and reaction time--the point stood; she still overwhelmed the Spirits in terms of clear and pure 'power'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's rays of light, Yoshino's cold air, Mukuro's blind spot attacks, Natsumi's transformations, Miku's sound waves, all of that were smash under a single blow. She howled as if to show that any resistance was futile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such is a beast released from its shackles. The girls involuntarily gulped at the divine presence she radiated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Kotori's goal wasn't to succumb to <Beast>or even try to kill her. But at this rate, it would be a wishful dream for her to start a conversation with Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, it felt that she was even more violent than before after being stripped of her swords. Perhaps she had started taking them seriously after having her weapons stolen. Or--perhaps those 'swords' really were a prison holding her down.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori laughed at that thought stealing her attention with sweat dripping down her face, Maria's voice came again from the headset.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--There's no time for a skirmish. <Yggdraramus>can only temporarily peel that Angels away from <Beast>. Wait too long and the Angels will once again become 'swords' that will be drawn to her. If so, there won't be any more options left."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't particularly like wasting time anyway……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori groaned and frowned back in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Maria may have not necessarily been trying to inspire Kotori and the others. Her words were just plain facts. Kotori clicked her tongue and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami! This clearly isn't working! We need to deliver a big one!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Understood!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Kotori's instructions, Origami raised her voice. Kotori gave a small nod, focusing her concentration while raising <Camael>overhead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, obeying Kotori's will, the battle axe changed shape--forming a huge muzzle that was attached to Kotori's thin arm. <Megiddo>. The form of the Angel of fire <Camael>which boasted the greatest firepower.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Metatron>--"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Origami gathered the countless 'feathers' floating around her and also created a cannon-formation shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because of their movements, <Beast>twitched her eyebrows. She narrowed her eyes to watch out and lowered her posture to jump.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it instinct, intelligence, or experience? Either way, it wasn't exactly clear what gave her this conviction, but she obviously saw Kotori and Origami as threats. And unfortunately, <Beast>'s speed far surpassed Kotori and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's mind was troubled by the conviction that firing <Megiddo>now would mean likely being dodged. No matter how powerful, it was pointless unless it landed.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, on the contrary, Kotori and Origami also had a momentary pause after firing. In front of her, that opening could prove fatal.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. She couldn't shoot like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">--If this went on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Yoshino! Miku!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been waiting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori shouted, Yoshino who was riding a huge rabbit doll and Miku who had a shiny keyboard surrounding her body, both replied back. Even though detailed instructions weren't given to both sides, they had been set up at a place located within <Beast>'s blind spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Zadkiel>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Gabriel>--<Rondo>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, as the surrounding temperature plummeted instantly, ice shackles appeared on <Beast>'s feet to anchor onto the ground. At the same time, an invisible sound wall piled up to restrain her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, gu, a, aa----!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, she hadn't anticipated this. <Beast>screamed and tried to move her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Kotori and Origami wouldn't miss this opportunity. Both of them pointed their two turrets at <Beast>and shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Camael>--<Megiddo>!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Metatron>--<Artelif>!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Fire and light.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dense Reiryoku concentrated in both turrets as it was released, etching two lines onto the empty sky. The sky, which was still dim at dawn, was brilliantly lit up as if set ablaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">In terms of raw firepower, <Camael>and <Metatron>were the strongest among the Angels.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each full-power blow was on course without the slightest hint of deviating, swooping down on <Beast>who was crucified onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--A, a, aaaaaaaaaaa------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just before being directly hit by those two bombardments, <Beast>let out a roar. With all her strength, she broke free from Yoshino and Miku's restraints.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya! Too violent!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino and Miku were left oozing out dismay, <Beast>kicked off against the ground and leapt into the sky. Kotori and Origami's full power bombardment passed through the space where <Beast>was just located a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">--However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. Imōtogo and Origami's blow, it shan't go to waste."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Oh, that's right. If it's you, I thought you would avoid it……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time. Unnoticed by everyone, Mukuro and Natsumi took a roundabout path to position themselves diagonally from Kotori and Origami. Both of them raised their Angels at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The key Angel <Michael>.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the mirror Angel <Haniel>that imitated that form.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Open the door, <Michael>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't……let you escape!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them inserted the tip of the khakkhara outward, opening a huge 'hole' there.</p>
<p class="null-p">The 'hole' inhaled the deadly blow from Kotori and Origami--releasing the bombardment from another 'hole' opened right behind <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ga……aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Light that scorched the heavens and fire from the pits of hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">A torrent of Reiryoku dyed in white and crimson engulfed <Beast>and pierced into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that spot--no, perhaps it boasted the greatest power on earth now. It was a single blow that combined the power of all the Spirits. The unparalleled herculean strength of that light of ruin wouldn't leave even dust behind for an ordinary creature.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how powerful <Beast>was, she wouldn't be safe from that. …… Actually, even now, Kotori considered to herself that they might have overdone it a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that being said, it was urgent to make her docile. This may mean her holding a grudge on Kotori and Origami, but it was Shidou's role to open her heart. If it meant capturing her, she would do as many hated roles as possible</p>
<p class="null-p">to--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Kotori!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori finally noticed from Shidou's sudden cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">The torrent of Reiryoku still left traces on the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">From within that dazzling pillar, a black shadow leaped out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Run away, Kotori!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou screamed as he looked up to the sky from the ground. "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa--------!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Kotori and Origami's proud certain-kill cannon fire.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>rushed to attack Kotori after receiving that huge blow with her entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she didn't come out completely unharmed. Her crackled and decaying Astral Dress had been further destroyed and was no longer at its original form. The tips of her hair which had lost its color were now singed at the tips. It wouldn't strange for her to collapse onto the ground after that disastrous spectacle.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in the midst of that, only the five 'claws' equipped to her hand had their blades shining brightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Imoto-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">One beat later, everyone screamed. But they wouldn't make it in time. A momentary pause of relaxation after that full-power blow struck. Even Kotori's consciousness couldn't catch up with her body right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">--With a roar that could shake the entire world, the five 'claws' swung down at Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's body could only defenselessly accept this slash--</p>
<p class="null-p">"----------Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, Shidou felt a sloppy voice leak out from his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't surprising at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, <Beast>, who was just about to slash at Kotori, suddenly crashed down to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ga……a!"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>glared at the sky after being slammed down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Raising his face and following that gaze--Shidou finally noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The blue sky illuminated by the morning sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was the appearance of a girl there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was--a Spirit. Her tall figure was clad in an armor-like straitjacket. Just like Kotori and the others, it was brimming with ample Reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">A giant spear held in the right hand. A shinning chain wrapped around the left hand. And on the back, wings that dashed through the sky were standing upright.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it wasn't that which caught Shidou's attention. Her long hair was like a muffler fluttering against the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Passionate and composed. Cheerful and tranquil.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those pair of eyes contained both contradictory elements.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou had strange feeling while looking at that fearless and lovely face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya……or is it Yuzuru?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou half-consciously called out those names.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That girl's face was reminiscent of somewhere in-between Kaguya and Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Shidou's voice reach her, the girl loosened the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as she proudly declared her name, her voice echoed in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Intrusion. For those afar listen to my cry. Gaze closer as you will.</p>
<p class="null-p">One horseman equal to a God. To solve this dilemma swiftly and skillfully. --The typhoon king reaping all of creation, I am Kazamachi Yamai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kazamachi--Yamai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou repeated and thought over the name the girl had called herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that led him to his conviction.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the name of when Kaguya and Yuzuru were human.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way, you are……could it be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Smile. Fu--"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou muttered while stunned, the girl--Yamai smiled fearlessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For a quick and helpful comprehension, this figure is formed through both Yamai Kaguya and Yamai Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It's all thanks to your assistance, my comrade. You gave me courage." "Me……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou rounded his eyes, Yamai gazed over and smiled as if finding that response amusing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pleasure. Good, we'll talk about this later.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shidou. For a man like you, wouldn't it be foolish to say nothing about a maiden appearing in her finest form?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Yamai narrowed her eyes mischievously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as Shidou was reflexively flabbergasted, he immediately realized her intentions and raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……too stylish. I was mesmerized just watching a moment ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuha."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Yamai burst out into laughter as if unable to hold it in any longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, in a manner that made her feel even more elegant, she pointed her spear at <Beast>who was glaring at her from down below.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Combat. Now, keep that as a greeting. Being left that much after having undertaken a dance with my comrades can really injury a lady's mood."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yamai said that, her wings slightly shook-- The next moment, her figure disappeared from the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou rounded his eyes in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, after a beat, he understood from listening to a violent explosion coming from <Beast>'s direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai had dashed in the sky at a speed too fast for the eye to follow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Assault. Hiyu----------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving only that voice behind in her original airspace, Yamai descended at high speed for <Beast>down below.</p>
<p class="null-p">A moment after kicking against the sky, a terrible impact struck her body. --Sound barrier. When a certain speed is exceeded, the air becomes a sturdy wall that stands in the way of any substance. Yamai's body exceeded that speed without even blinking and broke through that invisible wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">A resulting sonic boom that would shatter even a strong aircraft with a sturdy exterior, but Yamai was filled with a strange sense of excitement that made her want to shout.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Her body felt light. Her limbs were full of so much power that it felt like they would burst. Everything in the world seemed to stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">A world where Yamai had reached the pinnacle of speed. She was undoubtedly the ruler of this suspended world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But there was one person that stepped into Yamai's world.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>noticed Yamai approaching and swung with the claw attached to her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Five slashes marked with tremendous power were simultaneously released in front of Yamai. An interval on the brink of death. At the next moment, Yamai's body would be sliced into several parts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Splendid--"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yamai fluttered her body in the sky at a paper thin-distance--no, not even a single sheet of paper could dodge at this extreme distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">On her cheeks, chest, belly, hands, and feet, there was the feeling of being lightly stroked by the edge of these slashes. However, not a single drop of blood flowed out from Yamai's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">If <Beast>was able to perform at her best, the results would have been different. From her five slash attacks released; if least one of them would have struck Yamai, then the situation would have been completely overturned.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yamai was convinced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tanking a full-powered blow fired in coordination among the Spirts. That only dealt terrible damage onto her body. Ever so slightly, the accuracy of that 'claw' had been dulled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. This wasn't just Yamai's battle. This was a battle where everyone had staked their lives to carve out a path.</p>
<p class="null-p">This Sprit was too powerful. Originally, this would be an opponent Yamai could face.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, this moment was the time where everyone's contributions were accumulated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only at this moment, Yamai's wind surpassed <Beast>--!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Counterattack. Ha----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yamai offered generous praise to <Beast>, she lunged with the spear in her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">--<El Re'em>. The invincible assault spear that invoked the name of a qilin. The wind spiraled at the sharpest point, forming a small tornado.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A, aa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, <Beast>forcefully pulled her arm into the opposite direction, using the back of her 'claw' to parry the blow. The wind focused on the tip of the spear lost its focal point and dispersed around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……a……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yamai's counterattack wasn't just this alone. <Beast>'s face was marked with anguish.</p>
<p class="null-p">--<El Na'ash>. The chain baring the name of the serpent warped around <Beast>'s leg.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai placed her strength in her left hand, manipulating the chain to slam <Beast>'s body against the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>stood back up immediately, thrusting her 'claw' violently in an attempt to sever the chain. However, just before that, Yamai pulled her left hand to quickly recover <El Na'ash>.</p>
<p class="null-p">--If considering the Yamai sisters' style, since Kaguya's attack was avoided, Yuzuru anticipated this and made a successful attack to avenge Kaguya's regrets--could it be thought like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai laughed at herself for thinking up such mindless thoughts during a battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">She now knew. Kaguya looked to be in a regretful manner but also praised Yuzuru's achievement. Yuzuru also understood that Kaguya purposely assumed the role as the decoy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, this body was a fusion between Kaguya and Yuzuru. The consciousness that dwelled here had both of their intentions mixed together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Strictly speaking, this figure and consciousness wasn't exactly the same as when Kazamachi Yamai was human.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru, the two had undergone a history of growth together. As such, the two of them created a new form for Yamai.</p>
<p class="null-p">And they now discovered something after now achieving a fusion through the power of <Raphael>.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a distant memory. When Kazamachi Yamai was dying, the will of the nameless little sister that sprouted when the Sephira Crystal was given.</p>
<p class="null-p">She woke up from the power of the Sephira Crystal and to prevent her beloved sister's death, her heart, Yamai's heart, was assimilated into that body.</p>
<p class="null-p">The dying Kazamachi Yamai and the little sister that was never born.</p>
<p class="null-p">These two unclear factors, wandering between the threshold of life and death, managed to escape death by unifying their existences together.</p>
<p class="null-p">And as time passed, their hearts split into two again.</p>
<p class="null-p">--But the two Spirits born in this manner were a little different from the original two. Nothing was the same whatsoever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kazamachi Yamai and her unnamed sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru, both of them inherited different portions of both factors.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Bitter smile. Well really, for me to be actually worried about something so idiotic."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai suddenly loosened her cheeks as she set up both <El Re'em>and <El Na'ash>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This body is full of love from that nameless sister!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, she aimed at <Beast>while drawing forth <El Re'em>.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the next blow with <El Re'em>wasn't with <El Re'em>alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<El Tsuohuel>……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yamai cry out that name, she greatly stretched her body and threw with all her might.</p>
<p class="null-p">--A huge throwing spear with a chain fused to the tip of the spear's handle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Gu, ah--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as before, <Beast>tried to repel the spear with her 'claw', but then twisted her body just in time.</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have noticed. This attack was a bit different than the one before.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the threat of <El Tsuohuel>wasn't just limited to the power of the spear. A stronger wind was wrapped around that attack, gently blowing away <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ga--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Conclusion. This is--the end!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yamai loudly declared, she pulled on <El Tsuohuel>and aimed it again at <Beast>who was blown into sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A--"</p>
<p class="null-p">She imagined that <Beast>had let out a roar quieter than ever before. As she closed the fingers on her right hand, the five 'claws' hovering around her hand unified into one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Suspicion. What……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai slightly tensed her brows at this unexpected act.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that being said, it should be the same regardless. No matter what the opponent did, there was nothing that could break <El Tsuohuel>, the combination of both Kaguya and Yuzuru's power--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Wha."</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yamai was releasing <El Tsuohuel>, she stiffened her body and widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. That was because <Beast>'s claw was now transforming alongside giving off a pale light.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Holding onto a wide blade, a single great sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a screaming roar,</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>swung down the sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A storm swirled on the battlefield where Reiryoku was being scattered chaotically.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the midst of all that, Shidou raised his voice unintentionally while watching the battle between the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were many reasons. Within a matter of minutes, the battlefield had changed rapidly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone had regained their Reiryoku. With everyone's cooperation, Kotori and Origami landed a huge blow onto <Beast>. And now a fusion of the Yamai sisters was playing the role of fighting <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">But right, there was just one event that caught and wouldn't let go of Shidou's attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It was the sword swung by <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This, is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a stunned voice from his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the reaction of all the Spirits wasn't that much different from Shidou's own. Everyone had their eyes wide open, staring at <Beast>'s sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't surprising.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sword she had was-- "……<Sandalphon>……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">--Because it was the Angel of the sword once used by Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……does this mean……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou whispered while staring at <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, <Beast>carried ten swords that held everyone's power. If you think about it normally, it wasn't strange to also have <Sandalphon>'s power as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">But then, wouldn't it make sense that <Sandalphon>had also become one of the ten swords she carried?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was <Sandalphon>in her 'claw'?</p>
<p class="null-p">Could it be, she is--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yamai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's thoughts were interrupted by Kotori's cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Just like with Shidou, Yamai's attention was so snatched away by <Sandalphon>'s appearance that she received a front-side blow as retaliation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The slash from <Beast>'s <Sandalphon>engraved a deep crevasse onto the ground. Smoke was around rising from there, with no chance to confirm Yamai's safety.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun……! Yamai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That can't be……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The dismay of the Spirits echoed onto the battlefield. Having just saw Yamai's great efforts, the girls were now all trembling in fear. <Beast>'s attack was simply too powerful.</p>
<p class="null-p">--But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Apology. I was careless. To be caught off guard in the middle of a battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, a tremendous wind swirled. The smoke and dust around that area cleared up in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at the center of that--there stood a knight holding up a huge shield.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Display. --<El Peguez>. I dread to think what would happen without this."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Yamai lowered her shield. Apparently, she had folded the wings on her back and wrapped it around with her chain. Just like <El Tsuohuel>, this seemed to be one of the variations of her Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yamai! Are you okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naturally. But it was a close call."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yamai spoke, she narrowly exhaled and glanced sharply at <Beast>who was sitting in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exaltation. Your power, I have firmly confirmed it with my own eyes. I won't ask about that sword right now. --For that rudeness earlier, I will unveil my secret technique for revenge."</p>
<p class="null-p">And while saying that, she exaggeratingly stretched out both of her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the spear and shield in her hands, as well as part of her armor, flew into sky to create a new shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The form of a huge ballista that was overwhelming to look at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noha! W-What is this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following the movements of Yamai's hands, the ballista was pulled down and loaded as a surrounding terrifying storm brewed at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">And exactly like that, the clouds were cleared away, the rubble on the ground was reduced to dust, it was just like a huge dragon flapping its wings. The intense winds, which made it difficult to even stand, laid waste to this field of death.</p>
<p class="null-p">And before long, it all converged into the assault spear, which had become an</p>
<p class="null-p">arrow--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Liberation. <El Yevrun>--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Accompanied by Yamai's voice, she fired towards <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 9: Izayoi Muku</p>
<p class="null-p">Do you believe in heaven?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, no, this isn't a religious invitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is a heaven. It's relatively close. Specifically, it is in East Tenguu, Tenguu City, Tokyo. --Yes, it is our home!</p>
<p class="null-p">There is a secret garden where cute girls gather every night……also it comes along with Darling's delicious dinner, I have nothing more to say!</p>
<p class="null-p">Even a tried body with a hard daily schedule will be refreshed instantly by coming here!</p>
<p class="null-p">--But, it's been about a year and a half since meeting everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Recently, I often feel.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's nothing else other than this. Everyone is growing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi-san decided to go to junior high school while complaining. Mukurosan cut her hair. Origami-san and Kotori-san are still working hard as ever before. Kaguya-san and Yuzuru-san are learning new things on a daily basis. It seems that even Kurumi-san has been enthusiastically studying something recently. Nia-san seems to have gone on a large strike from drinking Chuhai beer……and not only that; she's overcome the past and hired an assistant. Well to start out, it's the story of a digital in-home assistant.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also--Yoshino-san's growth was shown when Tohka-san disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Darling's strength is in trying to overcome the loss of Tohka-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's strange. I am an idol.</p>
<p class="null-p">A person known to shine and sparkle inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once in a while, everyone is too dazzling. I also want to look that dazzling.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">--The wind ran through the battlefield.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the only way to describe this. The moment Yamai fired that giant ballista at <Beast>, a dense cluster of air drew a straight line across the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after that moment, there was nothing remaining left.</p>
<p class="null-p">The remnants of the piled up buildings.</p>
<p class="null-p">The traces of the road that should have been there.</p>
<p class="null-p">And of course--the appearance of the Spirit <Beast>who was on the receiving end of this arrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiya……amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How refreshing and beautiful……"</p>
<p class="null-p">One beat later, the Spirits began absent mindedly raising their voices at the overwhelming power displayed. Shidou also felt a jolt reach his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is a bit too much……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and everyone's utmost goal was to interact with <Beast>and make her fall in love. Certainly it was true that they couldn't talk properly, so their policy shifted towards neutralizing her first--but with this, they weren't even essentially sure if <Beast>was still safe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Trust. Fu--"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yamai was still expressing a smile with full composure, using both hands to dispel what she had set up. Then, in response to that movement, the giant ballista dissembled in the air and once again wrapped around her body as wings and armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that Spirit can be defeated through a single blow, she would have been long gone after receiving Kotori and Origami's bombardment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied while curling up his eyes. As if to match that timing, the ground swelled up and exploded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……, A--"</p>
<p class="null-p">From below the ground, using her sword as a cane, a girl's shadow emerged. --No doubt about it. <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">But having already received severe damage from Kotori and Origami's attacks, her Astral Dress could no longer serve as armor. Pale white skin craved with numerous wounds, rough breathing, trembling limbs, from the looks of it she had the appearance of barely standing by the skin of her teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">No--to be precise, even this was just a trivial change for her right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou faintly raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing there was <Beast>. That wasn't wrong at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bur right now, her atmosphere felt somewhat different from the raging Spirit just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I, am……, ……no, way……"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>looked around as if terrified. She gazed down at her own palms while her shoulders were trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">From that manner and words, Shidou remembered something from long ago as he stepped forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, <Beast>raised her face as if noticing this. For a moment, while looking at Shidou, her eyes widened in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Uh, ah, aaaaaaaaaaaah----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Quite as if rejecting Shidou's appeal, <Beast>let out a far off cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, while controlling the weight of her sword, she pointed the tip towards the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Be careful, everyone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tension ran past all of the Spirits during this moment. Everyone uniformly prepared their Angels, taking a defensive posture in preparation for the incoming slash.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the expected attack never occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!? What, is that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stared in astonishment at the spectacle spreading over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. As <Beast>drew a trajectory by swinging the sword, a crescentshape scar was opened in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Scar--a strange description for sure, but he could only describe it like this. It was as if space itself had been sliced and torn open.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there was no blood since space wasn't a living creature. There was only a dark color when peeking into that cross-section.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou thought about it for a second. --This scene looked somewhat familiar.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. At dusk yesterday, when <Beast>first appeared similar scars had been formed in that space. To be precise, during that time it had been torn apart by the claw hovering over her five fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Hold on! You are--"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time as recognizing that, Shidou screamed while extending out his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……,--"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>look like it was suffocating after listening to Shidou's voice, and without pause began to shove her body into the scar carved in that space.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……! No way, are you trying to escape!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't let you--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Michael>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits, after sensing <Beast>'s intentions, one beat later kicked off against the sky at once or activated their Angels.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--too slow. By the time the Spirits could reach her, <Beast>had already slipped into the crevices of that tear in space.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, the scar silently closed. The 'hole' extend by Mukuro's arm, <Metatron>'s rays of light, attacked that spot in vain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">--Unnatural silence filled the space that was just a battlefield until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Where did <Beast>go? Did she really escape? Or was she lurking somewhere and looking for a chance to strike back?</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits tensed up as the various possibilities swirled around. Everyone was on alert and looked around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tens of seconds afterwards, the sense of urgency had resolved as Maria's voice reached everyone through the intercom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--The Reiha response has completely disappeared. It seems she actually ran away."</p>
<p class="null-p">Simultaneous with that report, some Spirits let out a sigh of relief while others bit their lips in regret.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya……I really thought that I was going to die this time. Well, these results are fine. I'm glad everyone is still safe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia, the representative of the sigh group, exhaled out a heavy breath as she fell onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kotori, who stood behind her, folded her arms with a difficult look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……But our goal was just to capture <Beast>. It's difficult to say that everything went well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As serious as ever imoto-chan, won't your wrinkles increase if you keep looking like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey you……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori raised her brow, Nia waved her hand back in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Everyone survived this crisis, and everyone's tenacity was tied to everyone's life. Anything more than that is too greedy. Or did you want to capture Bea-chan at the expense of one or two people dying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Nia's remarks, Kotori mumbled those words out.</p>
<p class="null-p">But then, Maria's cold voice echoed to refute Nia's statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be fooled, Kotori. Even after saying everyone worked hard, Nia didn't contribute to the <Beast>battle, especially after regain her Reiryoku."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gikku!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia's shoulders trembled as she easily imitated that sound effect. Everyone half-turned their glances towards Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You should all know why!? My <Rasiel>is not suitable for battle! Future description takes time and in the first place isn't effective against strong Reiryoku people! The ever reliable mass produced Maria class making appearance was also no good!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was already decided to be impossible. My arithmetical functions were in full operation to maintain the effects of the <Yggdraramus>for as long as possible. I didn't have any spare capacity for anything else. Or rather, please think up something else that doesn't rely on others for an objective."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, nuguh……b-but even if you say that, it wasn't just me. Kurumin also did nothing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia pointed to Kurumi. But Kurumi didn't panic, saying 'ara, ara' while pointed her own finger at her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My sincerest apologizes. Because my <Zafkiel>steals my 'time' in addition to Reiryoku, I admit I couldn't participate very accurately. --But if allowed to absorb the 'time' of those fleeing the shelter, I could have rampaged as violently as needed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi smiled while saying that. A mysterious smile that was reminiscent of when she was called the Worst Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, that should be the case for Kurumi……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits all felt sweat dripped down their cheeks as they were convinced of what Kurumi had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi nodded, but then added a 'but' before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would be surprising if I didn't do anything at all. Although it may have been inconspicuous compared to your success, didn't you notice <City of Devouring Time>that was confined to <Beast>? And also--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……And also?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou slanted his head, Kurumi remained silent for a while before giggling and giving a meaningful smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Still a secret right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh! What's that supposed to mean! No fair! What's with those meaningful words spoken somewhat ambiguously!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia shouted while waving her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if it is Kurumi……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There may be something……yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, with sweat dripping from their cheeks, they placed their hands on their chin mumbled words like that out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's with just that Kurumin!? If you say it like that, it makes it sound like I didn't do anything!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, what were you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi asked, Nia flashed a smile as if waiting to hear those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Still a secret right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the Spirits all half-closed their eyes at this remark.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, if you say it like that.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's more important to apologize honestly, Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That response is clearly different from the one for Kurumin!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia stood up, crying while clinging onto Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waaah! Boy! Everyone is bullying me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……there, there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stroked her head with a bitter smile. Then, the surrounding Spirits all pierced Nia with gaze carrying various emotions. Nia lifted up her hands uncomfortably and released his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay calm down brother. Right now I was really careless. Especially Oririn. Can you stop giving off that bloodlust now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not particularly giving off any bloodlust."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Giving off suspicious bloodlust is a mark of inexperience. Pros only leave the consequence of death."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that even more dangerous to say!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia screamed with tears in her eyes. Seeing her in this state, the Spirits all smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia may have not been aiming for this, but the tension remaining in this spot had come apart in a single gulp. Shidou let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps as the Spirits also recognized the end of the battle, they gathered from the sky and ground to Shidou's location. A nostalgic feeling of him seeing the Spirits laughing and praising each other's accomplishments.</p>
<p class="null-p">Among them, Miku was the most enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya! Everyone was so wonderful! Reaaaaaly so cool! It's been a long time since wearing this greatest Astral Dress! Let's hurry and take a picture! Does anyone have a smartphone or camera!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With eyes shining brilliantly, she spread out her hands as if engulfing everyone. Everyone smiled bitterly at this same as always situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so--Yamai, if that's okay. To be honest, you saved us. It would have been far worse if you hadn't shown up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori turned her gaze to Yamai while speaking. Then, Yamai shrugged her shoulders opening her mouth to smile broadly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Denial. I just finished things up. You all are the ones who set the groundwork for the pieces in play. Be proud girls, this is your victory."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, she gave a wink. While this normally would normally be seen as annoying, there was strangely no sarcasm in her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh, Yamai-san, when Kaguya-san and Yuzuru-san were human……is that what you are?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey. Are you really Yamai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino and Yoshinon, both of who were still on <Zadkiel>, slanted their heads while asking. Yamai lightly shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explanation. I am certainly Kazamachi Yamai, but strictly speaking, I am not the same as the human Kazamachi Yamai. This body is just a fusion of</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai Kaguya and Yamai Yuzuru, both of whom have grown significantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, I wasn't this tall during my lifetime--nor did I arrive at a splendid figure like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">In a joking manner, Yamai flaunted her heavy breasts. It was a size that had surpassed even the plumb Yuzuru. Miku let out a manga-like "Muho-!" voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ya, Ya, Yamai-san! I-Is it okay to have a little hug!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Special. This way helplessly little kitten. Come."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nhiiiiii! Onee-saaaaaama!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With various liquids drooling from her mouth, Miku jumped towards Yamai's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, at the next moment, Yamai's body gave off a faint glow as her silhouette was split in two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Owa!? That's surprising!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Surprise. This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai--or rather Kaguya and Yuzuru after splitting apart again, rounded their eyes in astonishment. Inevitably, Miku, who was jumping into Yamai's chest, dived into the space between the two and fell loudly face first into the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mukya!? This unexpected touch!? Is this Onee-sama here!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry. There was something like a time limit……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apology. Originally it was a forced fusion. It was a miracle to keep it up to this point."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's……no, now that it has come to this, Kaguya-san, Yuzuru-san! Just a little hug from both sides!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku stood up, making a dash while spreading out her hands again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-wait, calm down!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shudder. She's not the type of person to be discouraged."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru pushed Miku back to halt her approach. Seeing Miku act the same as usual, Shidou couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm glad with this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a spectacle occurring was because everyone was safe. Shidou clutched on his chest to suppress the regret lingering there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Nia had a point. It was regrettable that they couldn't capture <Beast>, but he should also be delighted that everyone survived this crisis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was something else that he was worried about. It was <Beast>'s appearance after taking Yamai's attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">The tone of her voice, the light shining in her eyes, obviously the atmosphere surrounding her was different. Yes, it was as if--</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking of everything so far, Shidou reached a certain conclusion. He lightly held his intercom to talk to Maria.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Maria. Where did <Beast>disappear to? The Neighboring World…… shouldn't that no longer exist?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Shidou had asked, the Spirits who were all being noisy all raised their eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Neighboring World. It was the space where Spirits are said to exist. A world separated by this one through a thin layer. Originally, a spacequake was the aftermath of a Spirit arriving from the Neighboring World.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the Neighboring World should have disappeared with the death of the Spirit of Origin, Mio. So where did <Beast>disappear to?</p>
<p class="null-p">"……At the very least, the response is different from when she opened a 'hole' in space through <Michael>or the general phenomenon of disappearing and becoming lost."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria was silent for a few seconds before continuing on in a slightly regretful tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Unknown with only this current information."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou held his breath as he clenched his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">The answer wasn't unpredictable. Everything about <Beast>was an irregular Spirit. However, hearing those words out loud, a sharp pain struck his chest as if his heart was being tightly squeezed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps <Beast>retreated to heal her wounds. If so, it may still be possible to save her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the expression she showed just before disappearing. When looking back at that--Shidou was worried that she would never appear before him again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps sensing his disappointment, Kotori gently placed her hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't blame yourself too much. You did well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't save her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That mysterious Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">That child with a face full of despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl that held that sword--</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment, something arrived that blew Shidou's sense of resignation out of his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">--A shooting star from the sky fell right before Shidou's feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's eye felt disoriented from the dazzling light radiating from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time he noticed, there was--a single sword standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Beast>'s……sword?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone was left confused as voices of intrigue swirled around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. A single-edge sword that pursued the goal of tearing all to pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was undoubtedly the last sword <Beast>was carrying. --Her tenth sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why is this sword……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou whispered in a stunned manner, but then he recalled the scene that just had unfolded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, thanks to Natsumi's actions, all ten swords had been pulled from <Beast>and everyone instead regained the power of the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when counting Yamai as single person, there were nine Spirits here. Nine swords had appeared before them.</p>
<p class="null-p">During the battle, he couldn't afford to think about it--but the last sword must have disappeared to somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Shidou vaguely assumed that the tenth sword was <Sandalphon>after changing shape. After all, the first to ninth swords had all corresponded to their respective Angels. It was natural to think so.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that assumption was broken when the 'claws' <Beast>had swung transformed into <Sandalphon>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, questions began to arise.</p>
<p class="null-p">--What is this sword?</p>
<p class="null-p">And why was it standing before Shidou right now?</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no basis. But this didn't feel meaningless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was driven by the urge to reach out for the sword's handle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Shidou, be careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nodding at Kotori's advice, he made the decision--to tightly grasp that handle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if waiting for this, the sword pulsated and changed its appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">--A jet-black sword that emitted a mysterious shine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gazing at the appearance, Shidou involuntarily choked.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't surprising. After all it was--</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Nahemah>……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The other Tohka--Tenka's sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">Paired together with <Sandalphon>, it was the Demon King <Nahemah>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And the moment of touching it, Shidou felt a strange sensation.</p>
<p class="null-p">From <Nahemah>, something unusual seemed to be slowly permeating. The feeling of as if 'something' was speaking to his mind. It was as if the sword had a will that was appealing to Shidou--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I can. With this <Nahemah>……chase after that girl……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou half-consciously leaked such words out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Shidou-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits asked their questions as their eyes open in alarm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou continued on as he strengthened his grip on <Nahemah>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--<Sandalphon>is originally a sword that cuts through invisible things……every rule, concept, and even the wall separating the world. It's opposite <Nahemah>is also the same……</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the kind-hearted Tohka subconsciously sealed that dangerous power. By the way, you were inexperienced and couldn't master it, human……wait, what did you say!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou unintentionally turned his voice inside out as that voice was penetrating deep within his head echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, from their end, the Spirits could only see Shidou behave strangely. Their shoulders trembled from his yell as they glanced over at him with worried looks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Aah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lightly shook his head to regain his composure, placing all of his strength into his hands again-- He pulled <Nahemah>out of the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">--At that moment, a terrifying sense of intimidation attack his body. Demon King. A mystery that couldn't be grasped by human hands. Thinking back to it now, even though he's borrowed so many Angels now, this was his first time using a Demon King.</p>
<p class="null-p">Denial of life. The feeling of death. The waves of incoming minus power came to push and crush Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Likely, Shidou would have fallen to his knees from this heavy pressure. -- If he was without the help of the mysterious voice echoing in his head. "…………, Alright. With this……I can go. I alone……rather than--" Shidou muttered steadily while adapting to the sword in his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to this voice, the Spirits stood by breathless in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a minute, Shidou. What are you trying to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be, you're going after <Beast>?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the Spirits cry out, Shidou paused for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Aah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Briefly, he gave his reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">To that answer, Kotori tensed her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No way. I won't allow it. We have no idea where she went……and even if you reach her, isn't there no guarantee that you can come back here!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The other Spirits also had the same tense look as Kotori. Their expressions looked curled up by the complicated thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he didn't ask, he knew. Besides, it wasn't as if everyone didn't want to save <Beast>. Even if she wasn't a threat to the world anymore, they wouldn't be able to leave her alone. They weren't even thinking about that as the reason. Rather, if they could reach a hand out, they would do it just for that sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">But they may lose Shidou forever. That possibility casted a dark shadow in everyone's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou wasn't undervaluing himself. He was well aware everyone cared about him just as much as he did for them.</p>
<p class="null-p">So Shidou didn't want to run recklessly on his own. Because that would mean nothing more than trampling on everyone's thoughts. --That too, was something Shidou had learned from meeting with everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh--"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and the Spirits both simultaneously widened their eyes as their shoulders shook in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this field of rubble that was full of tension--</p>
<p class="null-p">"------------------------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, a beautiful singing voice came out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku--?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A familiar voice. No, before even that, there was only one person here that could sing this beautifully. Looking back at the source of this singing, Shidou called out the name of the owner of this voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so the unmatched diva smiled gently, as if embracing everyone's anxiety.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Kiyaaaaaaaaaa! Please help me, Darliiiiiiing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few months before <Beast>'s attack, as the red colored-leaves of the trees began to scatter in the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was sweeping the fallen leaves in the garden, a voice suddenly came from the street.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What the……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a beautiful voice like a rolling bell and the distinctive name of being called 'Darling', the identity of the voice's owner was immediately known. --Izayoi Miku. One of the girls who used to be Spirits and a legitimately licensed idol.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even after that was determined, the situation was still completely unknown. He looked back in a hurry to check outside. There, he found Miku running over here, disguised in sunglasses and a hat and with her plumb bust shaking vigorously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened Miku! What's going on!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He shouted back as he opened the gate to welcome Miku in. Then Miku screamed while pointing backwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person……that person is persistently chasing after me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou knitted his brow inquisitively as he looked towards behind Miku. Over there, he could see the figure of a woman dressed in a suit. While wearing a tight skirt and pumps not suitable for exercise, she was chasing after Miku with a desperate look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noticing that figure, Shidou began to feel nervous. Who was this person chasing after Miku in broad daylight? --An enthusiastic fan or stalker? DEM's remnants? Or a weekly journalist aiming for a scandal? The various possibilities disappeared as quickly as they came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I'll leave that for later. Anyway--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou pulled Miku's hand as she arrived at the Itsuka household, standing in front of the woman dressed in a suit to protect her. And with a resolute attitude, he confronted the woman running up to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is that child doing now? Depending on the situation……"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou's stiff expression quickly changed to a look of confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. The face of that woman, who was out of breath and covered in sweat, looked familiar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? If I recall, you are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haaah……haaah……Kurebayashi……Subaru……Miku's…… manager….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking as if she was gasping for air, that woman--Subaru gave her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Miku?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou glanced suspiciously towards Miku, she let out a "……Kyaha ☆" with an adorable wink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Going overseas?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, as Shidou invited those two into the living room of the Itsuka household, he rounded his eyes in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……actually the other day, there was this proposal from an American music company……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Subaru, sitting on the sofa opposite of them, was wiping away the sweat on her forehead with a handkerchief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, for ordinary visitors it was common to arrange guests to be sitting at the sofa facing opposite of Shidou. But right now, Miku was naturally sitting next to Shidou, wrapping her arms around him as she was leaning on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though this was a very scandalous image for an idol trying to flourish, Subaru was already well-aware of the circumstances (or rather that means she's already given up) and didn't raise any protest over this. And so, she continued on with any particular concerns.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, a producer over there heard Miku's song on a video site. From a glance, the ears were charmed and full support has been offered. Certainly, that singing voice should be spread to the world……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou nodded to show his agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">A sudden story for sure, it would be a lie to say that he wasn't completely surprised. But by no means did he ever think that this would be impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, Miku was a former Spirit with the power to channel her Reiryoku into her voice. A singing voice marked with devilishness nectar. That was how she could manipulate people with a single word.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Miku's popularity as an idol, speaking if it was something fictionally fabricated by the power of the Spirits--that was never the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">The natural quality of that voice, both her singing ability and performance was backed up through solid effort</p>
<p class="null-p">An overwhelming presence that captured and wouldn't let go of one's eyes and ears, this was undoubtedly her power and not something given by the Spirit of Origin. He didn't even have to understand to tell the feelings of producer with ears now charmed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But how does this story lead to that chase for just a moment ago? As far as I heard, this sounds like good news……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Subaru had a difficult look while glancing at Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">But then, Miku turned her face away in easy-to-understand gesture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how many times you say that, I still refuse! I won't go to the United States!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……And, this is why."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou nodded with sweat dripping from his cheeks. Then, he turned to look at Miku who was clinging onto his arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, can I ask why? Why do you hate it this much? It's not as if you dislike the United States……am I right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, who wouldn't be glad to see their activities expanding? I'm grateful for the opportunity and would be happy if my songs could be spread to even more people. But--"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Miku slammed against the table while shouting loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means launching a new career in America! And that would mean the time spent with Darling and everyone will be reduced!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……right. Thank you for the expected answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said that with a bitter smile. Miku smiled in a carefree manner and replied with "Don't mention it!" Without a hint of sarcasm, it seemed those words were said in pure appreciation of Shidou's thanks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Subaru scratched her face with a grumpy look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, please reconsider this, Miku. Isn't this a unique opportunity?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I--said--no! How many times have I refused now!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Miku, this producer is sweeping the American music industry at just the age of 30, the skillful P--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humph! Even if you say that, my reasoning won't change!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--A tall glamorous career type woman that's also a blonde hair beauty!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugu……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she heard what Subaru said, Miku's shoulders trembled. But she clenched her teeth, shaking her head while pinching the back of her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Something like that……won't get me on board with this……!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This appearance made him recall Kotori trying to resist her destructive impulses. Well no matter how pitiful she looked then, Shidou could never put that into words as an older brother taking his little sister's feelings into consideration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……then I have no other choice……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Subaru dejectedly lowered her shoulders. ……When considering a last resort with the information at hand right now, he could only guess what treatment was given to Miku at the office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, Shidou-kun. Could you also speak up? This really is a choice that could determine Miku's future. That's right, I understand Miku's feelings. But five or ten years later, I don't want Miku to have any regrets."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, m-me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the conversation suddenly shifted to him, Shidou suddenly widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Subaru's glance and Miku's slight anxious gaze was piercing him from both directions. Shidou faintly squirmed from this uncomfortable feeling as he thought over this in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could understand Subaru's feelings very well. She was Miku's manager.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku's first fan who has seen Miku's success more closely than anyone else. She would never want to miss the chance of having Miku's songs resonate across the entire world--if it was Miku, she must have believed her to have the potential in becoming a world diva. In fact, Shidou also shared the same idea with Subaru about Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he could also understand Miku's feelings as well. She has never had a life that has been trouble-free until now. It was no wonder that she was valuing this peaceful life so much right now. ……And somehow, more than a week of not having Natsumi (it didn't have to be her, but for some reason Natsumi's face was the first that came in mind) to hug might prevent Miku from keeping her always energetic mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a small groan as he raised his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I would like Miku to do whatever she wants."</p>
<p class="null-p">After thinking it over, Shidou came to that conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that, Miku let out an energetic "Kyaa!" cry. On the other hand, Subaru let out a dejected "Ugh…..!", as if she had taken an arrow to the knee.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected of Darling! I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While crossing her arms even more so, Miku jumped on the couch. Shidou continued his words while smiling over Miku's actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I want Miku to participate actively……but more than that, I want Miku to be happy. If Miku thinks her life right now is more important…… than I will respect her decision."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Darling……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku shed gentle tears hearing what Shidou had said. Without any pause, she reached out to embrace him. Feeling his shoulders being tapped, Shidou felt his cheeks start to flush red from embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">After having her fill from the temperature and scent of this embrace, Miku took a deep breath and turned to Subaru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And there you have it Subaru-san! Give up gracefully!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-The last hope……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Miku said that, Subaru stood up powerlessly and began walking to the corridor.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, just as she was about to leave the living room, her eyes sharpened and she pointed her finger at Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Remember Miku……even if you defeat me, the second and third assassin will arrive to persuade you……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu! I'm not afraid of that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, hello. It was hopeless after all. Yes, please send over a cute child from the production over there. A must-have spoiled onee-san type and a meek junior type. Also make sure that their Japanese skills are weak."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What!? The enemy is much better than I thought!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Subaru left with an evil laugh as Miku screamed while pressing her hands against her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few seconds later, the sound of a door closing was heard. After confirming that, Miku suddenly exhaled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Darling. I was persistently in trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……well, it can't be helped. It's an amazing discussion, so Kurebayashi-san had no other choice but to be like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That may be true……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku sharpened her lips as if displeased, but then quickly brightened her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I am happy. Darling told me. After all, Darling wants to be with me too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un…..well, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Miku like this, Shidou gave a somewhat troubled look--but then he immediately nodded and tried to erase it with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than being famous, I think it's best for Miku to live in way where she feels most satisfied."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! As expected of Darling, you understand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Miku replied with a smile, Shidou interjected with a 'but' as he continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Miku wants to take on this challenge, I'll support you with all my strength. What I want you to remember is that whatever you choose, I will always be Miku's ally."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Darling--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku choked once more on her tears as she hugged Shidou again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was worried about the complicated look that was expressed for a moment--it gradually faded away from the warm feeling filling his body.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">--In the end, it took no more than four months for Miku to understand Shidou's feelings from then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. When Shidou wanted to pursue after <Beast>and head to the other world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amidst the confusion and frustration between the Spirits, Miku alone was trapped with a mysterious look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, this is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whispering in a voice that no one could hear--she became aware.</p>
<p class="null-p">She herself was in the same position as Shidou at this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the scale and situation was completely different. Above all, Miku chose stability over challenge, while Shidou was taking a new step forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the most important turning point came at the important people watching their choices. It couldn't help but feel like a strange coincidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">And there were things she could feel just from being placed in the positon of being a third party.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou wants to follow after <Beast>. He wanted to reach out to her who disappeared into the world beyond. That wasn't wrong at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was no guarantee he could ever return to this world after crossing over in this wall of space. This was--no to be more precise, it wasn't possible for Shidou to endure making Miku and the other Spirits sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">And at the same time, she recognized there was something else.</p>
<p class="null-p">--She didn't want to be a burden for Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, she didn't want to be separated from Shidou. She wouldn't know what to do if it meant no longer be able to see Shidou anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the fact that her feelings served as a shackle for Shidou, steering him from a choice he wanted, was an intolerable pain for Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an inescapable contradiction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku, the Spirits, didn't want to lose Shidou--</p>
<p class="null-p">But at this moment, he was the one who made the choice to save <Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku felt a strange emotion as she narrowed her eyes looking at the other Spirits with anxious expressions.</p>
<p class="null-p">So it's persisting like this, Miku thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Miku was convinced that everyone must be thinking the same, aware of it or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because all of the Spirits met Shidou just like Miku, having been saved by Shidou just like Miku, spent time with Shidou just like Miku--loving Shidou just like Miku, because they were friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, what should Miku do now? What was it that Miku needed to do now?</p>
<p class="null-p">When thinking over this, she operated the headset to talk to only Maria.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Maria-san. I have a request, is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Actually--"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Miku told her wish, Maria responded with a 'ho' sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's it. If that's the case, it is possible for the current <Fraxinus>. I'll arrange it right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Then please do so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad you are there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you just fall in love? Aren't I always welcoming?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Always including something like that no matter what.</p>
<p class="null-p">--And, preparations are done. You may start at any time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, as expected, you work fast."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku laughed while saying that. Then, she quickly took in a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Gabriel>--<Fantasia>."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a voice channeling all of the Reiryoku she held right now--</p>
<p class="null-p">A song, she started to sing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------------------"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a beautiful, brave--and gentle song.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou and Kotori were conflicted over the matter of <Beast>, their eyes and ears were snatched away in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was not just a beautiful melody. The song had a dense Reiryoku that could be felt from just moving one's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha--"</p>
<p class="null-p">From both eardrums--no on the contrary, he could perceive this melody through the surface of his entire body. Shidou felt the pain left in his body being alleviated.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, that wasn't all. All of his exhausted limbs were full of energy and all of his sensory organs were sharpened. It was as if being immersed in <March>and <Requiem>, a feeling of his body being basked in a collection of <Gabriel>'s songs.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_22_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The other Spirits must have felt the same. They blinked their eyes in surprise, astonished at the pain suddenly disappearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------,------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, as the song came to an end, Miku made a big gesture as if giving thanks for her performance.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou and the Spirits suddenly felt their throats clog up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thunderous applause and cheers arrived from the intercom worn by everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou and the others were left surprised, Miku flashed a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you surprised? I asked Maria-san to connect us to a nearby shelter. Everyone is worried and some may be injured. --An invitation to Miku's long-awaited concert. Wouldn't it be a waste not to gather more people?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Furthermore, only the transmission of the song is being sent, so there shouldn't be worries of needing a follow up conversation afterword."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria added on as a supplement. Nothing but the most skillful work carried out. Shidou smiled at Maria's meticulous nature.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Miku loosened her cheeks and turned to face Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, how are you feeling, Darling? That was my full-powered song."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……I was a little surprised, but it was amazing--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Have you gathered enough power to make <Beast>-san fall in love and return back to this world without fail?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Miku's words quickly obstructed Shidou's words, Shidou unintentionally widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, aren't I still the Onee-san? Then at times like this, let me play the role accordingly."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Miku said that, she turned towards Kotori and the others Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right, everyone. I'm going to be helping Darling. If you have any complaints, please leave them with me. I'll listen to all of them."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Miku……smiled and moved her fingers accordingly. The Spirits all let out a startled 'hii' cry and stepped back.</p>
<p class="null-p">But eventually, the Spirits sighed as if giving up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Nmm, in the end it'll be like this after all. It can't be help I suppose. Because it is boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun…….If Nushi-sama had chosen this in a calm manner, in the first place there is no reason for Muku and the others to not agree."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Smile. By the way, Yuzuru wasn't apposed from the beginning. Incidentally, Kaguya has teary eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, can you stop saying things at your own convenience!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Relaxing their facial expression, they all began speaking in turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, the fears built up weren't suddenly gone from Miku's' dialogue', nor were they being manipulated by Miku's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was one reason only.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because of what Miku conveyed in her song.</p>
<p class="null-p">And perhaps because of realizing the thoughts being conveyed were the same as their very own.</p>
<p class="null-p">Originally, a song is something that channels one's feelings. --Especially so if it's a song with blessings of an Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku's song not only empowered everyone, but also conveyed the singer's resolve and determination to everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Be careful. If it's Shidou-san, you can do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do your best, Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be preparing the celebration party."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, if it's Shidou, it should be okay somehow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A woman in need doesn't suit me very much……fufu, but I wish you all the best on your special endeavors today."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was being encouraged by the Spirits, he turned to Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………, Humph, if you don't return expect all of the black history collected by <Ratatoskr>to be exposed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's……I guess I have to come back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou laughed at that awful plan, Kotori grabbed Shidou's collar and pulled herself into his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, pressing her forehead against his chest, she whispered in a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Definitely come back……Onii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Aah, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou answered briefly while gently stroking Kotori's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">After doing that for a few seconds, he finally turned to face Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Miku. This power and determination I've received from you. I'll never waste it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, of course. It was an invitation from the world idol Miku, a single song sang with all my power. Please go capture <Beast>and return home." Miku continued on while laughing mischievously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you're too late--won't I have already become a world diva by then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing what those words mean, as Shidou rounded his eyes, Miku's lips still kept smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I am an idol. The personification of something shining and glistening. In order to keep shining in front of everyone like now--and to be someone admired by everyone, I have to become at least that much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haha, for sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou laughed while shrugging his shoulders. Then, he braced his heels as he placed all of his strength in gripping <Nahemah>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I'll be back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, we'll be waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">From behind, the voices of the Spirits, including Miku, could be heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, from <Nahemah>, a 'hurry up" was transmitted to him through a tremor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou breathed out a thin breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Haah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out a fighting cry, he swung down <Nahemah>.</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment, as tremendous pressure was placed onto both hands, <Nahemah>'s jet-black blade tore through space. --A crescent-shaped 'scar' was created in that empty space.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the exact same as what <Beast>created earlier, the world coming apart at the seams. An unknown door had opened there.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know what would be ahead. He didn't know which world he would arrive at.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing certain was that <Beast>would be ahead--a lonely girl with sad eyes who exerted a power beyond human comprehension.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's more than enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou whispered as he placed his strength into his feet--</p>
<p class="null-p">He jumped into the unknown world.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ugh, uh--"</p>
<p class="null-p">--Sense of discomfort was instantaneous.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the shockwaves violently rattled Shidou's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a comparison, the sensation was similar to being sent into the past through the Twelfth Bullet <Yud Bet>. Intense dizziness that would make one unable to even stand. If he didn't receive <Gabriel>'s blessings, or if <Nahemah>wasn't in his hands right now, he would have collapse on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, he was forcing himself into someplace where he shouldn't exist. He was lucky that the dizziness was only at this level. "Haah……haah……over there……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking deep breaths, he placed his hand against his forehead while looking around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was at a loss for words at the sight spread out before his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">--A field of rubble as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a landscape similar to the original world where he was at. For a moment, he thought that he had failed to move at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, wrong. Shidou bent down to his knees to inspect the ruins of the buildings making up the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">The building material had been absurdly crushed into pieces. Moss was growing from it as the dust formed a layer. At the very least, this hadn't been destroyed a few days ago. Months or years……trampled down on with overwhelming power, the condition was left as it was without any attempts at reconstruction.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the problem was the range. Shidou narrowed his eyes while looking off into the distance once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was useless. Nothing could be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">Any safe buildings or cars, or even any forest and mountains, there was nothing left.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. All of the scenery in Shidou's field of vision had been completely flatten.</p>
<p class="null-p">A sight as if it was embodying the destruction of the world. A world of death as if all life was extinct, except for a few plants. Shidou shook his head to shake off his own imagination growing to sinister.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately, his thoughts were interrupted.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was very simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the rubble--he found a girl there.</p>
<p class="null-p">An Astral Dress in tatters and wounded skin. She was now crouching on the ground as if resting, faintly lowering and raising her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her back looked too weak to be the same Spirit that trampled down on the city earlier--she looked just like a crying girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly, his voice leaked out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then as she noticed that, the girl's shoulders faintly shook.</p>
<p class="null-p">Raising her face to see Shidou, her eyes opened in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W, h, y……are you here……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, she stood up and took a step back from that spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if she was afraid of Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that appearance, Shidou thinly exhaled.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know what happened. It wasn't exactly clear where this was yet. But from that sight alone, it was enough to be convinced that his intuition was correct.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you. For you, I--"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou looked into that girl's eyes, he put his words on pause.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. For a second person, to use those words for her, it felt a little different than if done for a stranger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I came to save you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl looked like she was suffocating from Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way……you followed after this me……. No, I decided, I wouldn't see you anymore. Not good, I'm--"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's words never reached its conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't surprising.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Because Shidou's lips were blocking that girl's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">--It was a method that had been repeated many times.</p>
<p class="null-p">To kiss a Spirit to seal that power, in this world a forbidden ceremony permitted for only Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, right now that wasn't Shidou's intention. Now that Mio had disappeared, it wasn't clear if Shidou still even had his sealing ability.</p>
<p class="null-p">But something like that wasn't relevant for Shidou right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had decided for a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he could met her, then--</p>
<p class="null-p">He would hug her with all her strength and kiss her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she had changed her 'claw' into that great sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">After he held <Nahemah>in his hands and heard that voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">No--maybe since he first met her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou knew her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">A few moments after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice leaked out from <Beast>after that kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">And. <Beast>--Yatogami Tohka whispered like such.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_22_14.jpg">
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 10: Yatogami Tohka</p>
<p class="null-p">...Shi...do...</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"……So he's gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">That empty space--while looking at the space where the crescent-shaped scar had occurred just a few moments ago, Kotori muttered those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">A loneliness that was difficult to describe had filled her lungs. In a world where Shidou had disappeared, she didn't even care much about this thin silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Kotori knew that this mood was a matter of concern. Dawn was soon approaching. They were at a field of rubble where inhabitants no longer remained. But now that <Beast>was gone, it was natural for this space to be dominated by certain stillness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori clutched her chest. She believed that Shidou could surely do it. That surely he will come back safely. That was why in the end they had sent him off.</p>
<p class="null-p">But still--the tremendous sense of anxiety tightly squeezed Kotori's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Kotori."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps sensing her feelings from her appearance, the Spirits called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The complexion of their faces was similar to Kotori's own. Seeing this, Kotori slightly shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, the opponent was an unidentified Spirit. And what he had stepped in was a world on the other side that was completely unknown. Perhaps they'll never see Shidou again. With that in mind, she almost began to cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Kotori, as the commander, couldn't let the others become worried. Kotori patted her cheeks to force more enthusiasm into herself and then turned her eyes to face everyone again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure it's fine since ……Let us do what we can. When Shidou returns and sees that post-processing isn't over, we'll defiantly be laughed at.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori said that, the Spirits all uniformly nodded in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. Certainly that holds to be true."</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking at everyone, Origami placed her hand against her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can leave the assumption that this destruction is caused by a spacequake. Then priority should be given to the people who saw our faces during the rescue attempts through the <Yggdrafolium>."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……speaking of which, they should have been able to clearly see the faces of Natsumi's group."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Concerns. Even if press relations can be controlled by the power of <Ratatoskr>, it wouldn't be possible to capture all of the personal social media accounts--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please rest assured. We are already working on that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, in response to everyone's concerns, Maria's voice came out from their headsets.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Currently, all networks in this area are under my control. All sightings uploaded through smartphones in the shelter have already been deleted. Any attached videos and photos have been removed from both terminal and cloud. Currently, we are running a fraudulent scheme to send false information over the network in advance. In a few days, this will all calm down and become just a legend of this town."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haha, amazing."'</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi forced a smile with sweat dripping down her cheeks. From her expression, the idea of "it'll be an absolutely no-good mistake to have you as an enemy….." was oozing out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever the skillful wiles, Kotori let out a sigh in admiration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected of you. --Well then, everyone should undergo a medical checkup. If possible I want to collect data on Angels and Astral Dress while everyone still possess Reiryoku. Well, that shouldn't be too hard. Ah, <Fraxinus>'s repairs are also an urgent priority."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori arranged the list of work needed to be done with her fingers, Nia let out an "ehehe' sound while give off a relaxed smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, let's hurry it up without rushing, imoto-chan. I think it's about time for boy to have a touching reunion now. Well, that's not exactly correct though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……wait, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While nodding, Kotori suddenly looked at Nia suspiciously.</p>
<p class="null-p">The manner Nia was speaking, she could catch something off about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then it finally came to mind. The authority of the Angel that Nia possessed. It was left out of her thoughts because of being distracted by the fight with <Beast>……but what she carried was the book Angel <Rasiel>, which made all the information in this world available to her if desired.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Nia. Do you know something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori narrowed her eyes, Nia stayed silent for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………Hehe☆"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she stuck out her tongue in a comical tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's nothing to laugh at! If you had already investigated through <Rasiel>, why didn't you mention it any sooner!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's right! If you had told this to Shidou, he could have been more prepared!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori and the others pressed closer, Nia bowed with sweat dripping down her cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well calm down first……I would have spoken up if it was dangerous information. And also--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia suddenly smiled, casting her eyes down in a meaningful manner for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If he couldn't take a step further without prior information, I thought it would have been better to not go at all. --Well, since it was Boy, I didn't think he would care about such things either."</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to what Nia said, the Spirits let out a collective "mu" groan. To be honest, even if there was still a feeling of being wrapped in smoke, it would be difficult to pursue an investigation after placing their faith in Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Well, then you shouldn't give spoilers here then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. Spoilers at this stage would be a little unsavory……huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Maria's voice from the headset, Nia nodded back in response --but then noticing everyone's intense gaze, her shoulders trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's dirty! I've been guided to an interrogation now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Niiiiiaaaaaaaa--?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya! Save meeeeeee!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia sadly screamed while hiding behind Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">It easy to see what Nia chose her as a shelter. Among the angry Spirits, Kurumi was the only one laughing with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it should be fine. What Nia-san says is not wrong. If not prepared to step into the darkness, then inevitably nothing can be obtained. --Don't worry, Shidou-san will surely be able to return back safely."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It feels as if you're also aware of something."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori pointed that out, Kurumi narrowed her eyes while laughing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, I have nothing specific to go off like Nia-san. In my case it's just conjecture. No, a premonition may be a better way to phrase this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get to the point. What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori said that, Kurumi suddenly loosened her cheeks and snapped her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--<Zafkiel>."</p>
<p class="null-p">The same moment of calling out that name, a giant clock emerged from the shadows behind Kurumi's feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a huge disaster for the person cowering behind Kurumi right now. Nia, who was right there, toppled over, rolling up the hem of her Astral Dress in the process and then boldly exposing her buttocks.</p>
<p class="null-p">……But, for some reason there wasn't even the fragments of sex appeal either. Miku was the only one saying "hoho, this is, this is……" while stroking her chin and giving off the impression of an expert for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than be bothered by that sequence of events, there was something more important to focus on now. Kotori narrowed her eyes while looking at <Zafkiel>'s dial.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ⅳ, Ⅵ, Ⅶ, Ⅷ, Ⅺ, Ⅻ--</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, half of the 12 numbers had lost their color.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori was left confused over this, Kurumi looked up to the sky and let out a small laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--It means that there is a rebellious deviant in every world."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">In this land of death where all life had died out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was standing still quietly while holding onto that girl's shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Again, he looked at this girl's appearance. Hair that had lost its color, worn out cheeks, a look that didn't resemble the 'girl' in his memories at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the light regained in those eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The eyes staring at Shidou as if frightened, surely that was 'her'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tohka--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou called out that name, Tohka lightly shook her shoulders. It was as if she considered hearing Shidou call out that name a serious crime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Tohka. Yatogami Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the exception of Mio and Kotori, she was the first Spirit that Shidou had</p>
<p class="null-p">met--</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit who disappeared a year ago in front of Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past year, there wasn't a day that went by without thinking about her. There wasn't a day where he didn't think about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every day was full of regrets, wishing that he could have done more for her. If he could see her again, he was willing to make any sacrifice.</p>
<p class="null-p">That Tohka was right before his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, Shidou almost started to cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">--But, no. Bite your lips and suppress these emotions from running amok.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The information permeated into his head when holding onto <Nahemah>.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, after kissing Tohka, a hazy and dim memory flowed in.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou then noticed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The girl in front of him right now, was Tohka but also not Tohka. "……Shidou……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka whispered steadily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But……you're not……the Shidou I know……"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, it looks like she inherited the same words and thoughts that he had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah. It seems like that apparently."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou suppressed the urge to yell in order to reply back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here……is a bit different from the world that I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Raising his face, he whispered while watching this desolate landscape.</p>
<p class="null-p">A distant world that he arrived by going through a scar opened up through <Nahemah>.</p>
<p class="null-p">A region that was slightly off from Shidou's own world. A future where some of the options had shifted.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It was a place that could be called a 'parallel world'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, this sounded like an absurd story. But inferring from the information gained through <Nahemah>, Shidou was surprised to find out that was not a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou didn't doubt this. --Strictly speaking, this wasn't the first time that Shidou had experienced a parallel world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Kurumi's Angel <Zafkiel>. Through the Twelfth Bullet <Yud Bet>, Shidou redid the worst world where Origami killed her parents with her own hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, through the Sixth Bullet <Vav>, he redid the future where the Spirits were all trampled down by Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, he could think of it as shifting to a new world where new options have been chosen.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was one of those different possibilities.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather Tohka not disappearing had caused the world to be transformed into this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka turned her gaze downward as if not quite knowing what to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, for troubling you. I know it's not an issue I can just apologize</p>
<p class="null-p">for……</p>
<p class="null-p">……Somehow……it felt like I was having a long dream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Un."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou briefly replied. It was easy to just grant forgiveness through his mouth alone. But he was convinced that would just end up hurting Tohka even more. Surely, Tohka apologizing was for others as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, Tohka. Can you tell me? What happened in this world. And why do you……look like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Tohka hesitated for a moment before spinning out the details of her story.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The specific parts……I can't remember. There's the feeling of mist covering my head. But…..ah, that's right, I don't even know how long ago it</p>
<p class="null-p">was--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka continued on while tightly gripping the cuff of Shidou's clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Shidou……died."</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt as if his breathing was going to come to a halt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, this is a world that followed a different future from Shidou's own. Such a possibility was not inconceivable.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't his death in this parallel world that surprised him--but rather it was because of this that both Tohka and the world had undergone such a transformation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Umu. ……I felt sad, painful, and helpless……by the time I noticed, I already--looked like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Tohka continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">A tremendous despair filled her heart. She was attacked by the feeling of her very self being painted pitch-black.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Certainly, the feeling of being pulled into the abyss was similar to inversion. But as Tohka's despair grew even more, so did the scale increase.</p>
<p class="null-p">Armored in this despair, Tohka had already become a different creature.</p>
<p class="null-p">She just swung her claw with these rampaging emotions, a beast that-- severed the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that assassin's dagger was even turned on her fellow Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">She killed everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">She erased everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">She destroyed everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until there was nothing left that could fill this emptiness--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's the end of this world. --I've destroyed this world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Quietly, Tohka whispered that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She told with difficulty, but also with concise words to detail the records of the destruction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression was colored by an extraordinary grief, self-condemnation, with everything else being filled by a sense of self-depreciation. Shidou felt his heart being tightly squeezed from just seeing this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………I, see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said those words with a hint of regret. It was necessary to know more about this world. However, it may have been too harsh to force Tohka to explain it through her own mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps noticing Shidou act this way, Tohka shook her head a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Don't look like that. This is necessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……but."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Tohka suddenly relaxed her expression. In some respects, she must be yearning over the old days.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter which world, Shidou is still Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haha."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that said, Shidou vaguely laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Tohka saw the face of this world's Shidou through him, he also saw the traces of the Tohka he once knew through her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu? What's wrong Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no……"</p>
<p class="null-p">While finding it difficult to speak, Shidou asked one more question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's right. Why did Tohka come to our world?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked that, Tohka placed her hand against her chin while having a difficult look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That……I don't quite know. Destroying any scenery still visible, but even then the crying wouldn't go away. I remember for some reason or another. ……Surely, I was looking for the scent of a Shidou that should no longer exist. ……But by then, I didn't even understand what that meant anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you mean……you felt my scent? Is my scent something that can be felt even across different worlds?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Mu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka frowned as she pondered over this. After a while, she looked up as if recalling something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It felt……like I was called upon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, while slanting her head, she muttered those words. Shidou also moved his neck in a similar gesture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Called upon? Wait……by whom?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I don't know. ……In the first place, it's like a vague memory or even an entirely intuitive circumstance. But, like a voice……I was being led by something that couldn't be seen……that's what it felt like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou groaned over not understanding this, Tohka faintly shook her eyebrows as if noticing something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou……how did you arrive at this world?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……thanks to this <Nahemah>. ……All because of this sword guiding me here."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, he tightly gripped the handle of the sword in his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if <Nahemah>was saying that its role was over--or perhaps saying it didn't want to interfere with Shidou and Tohka--it's form gradually vanished.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……The moment of grabbing this handle, various things were transmitted to me. At first I didn't know what it was……but surely, there was an appeal for "I want you to save Tohka". ……Ah, no, in the case of that person, I suppose, "I'll kill you human if you don't save Tohka" would sound better."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou spoke while straining a smile, Tohka tensed her brows in wonder. Perhaps in this world, Tohka and Tenka have never directly met before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah. Haughty, arrogant, and terrifying--a gentle God that loves Tohka very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fumu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, trying to recognize what Shidou is saying, tilted her head as if saying she couldn't understand this. She gave a complicated look with a bitter smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter who it is, I have to thank that person. I was able to regain my sense of self. …….Maybe, it was a little too late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou felt the pain in his chest tightening, he thinly let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also……need to give my gratitude. Thanks to that blessing, I was also able to see Tohka again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……? Also……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Shidou say that, Tohka curiously rounded her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right. Shidou lowered his gaze. Not surprisingly, this Tohka didn't know anything about the Tohka from his world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I……also have to talk about my world."</p>
<p class="null-p">And it was then that Shidou had noticed. Tohka was still left in a wounded and half-naked state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, Tohka. Would you like to change the location? I want to talk more properly--"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he said that, Shidou quickly reconsidered.</p>
<p class="null-p">At times like this, there were more appropriate words to choose from.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……no, that's not it.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Tohka, go on……date with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those words, Tohka raised her face up in surprise--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Umu."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, she replied back a little bashfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">From a single glance at this object, it was unlikely anyone would recognize it as a high school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">A distorted quadrilateral that consisted of stained steel frames and sparse wall material. Even clay work done by an infant would have captured the features more accurately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, just maintain its shape could be considered an anomaly in this land of death. --Whether a coincidence or not, he didn't know if Tohka had unconsciously avoid destroying this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could this be……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu……this is the school that we went to."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou blankly whispered, Tohka replied back while looking up at the crumbling school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Tohka had said that there was a place she wanted to take Shidou-- and the destination arrived was at the site of Raizen High School.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is it? If I could meet Shidou again, I want to come here together…… that's what I thought."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listen to Tohka's words, Shidou opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tohka didn't seem aware of Shidou noticing as she cleared her throat with a cough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……sorry, I can't explain it well, but……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--No, it's okay. ……I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said while staring into Tohka's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">For Shidou, if it meant being reunited with Tohka, there were also so many places he wanted to go together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu, yeah…… Fufu--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka laughed happily in some way or another as she grabbed Shidou's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, let's go, Shidou. The goal is the rooftop."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, she pulled on Shidou's hand as they entered the ruined school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was still a disastrous scene. If the corridor was in tatters, then the staircase wouldn't remain satisfactory. The condition of the building grew worse the more one went upstairs. Eventually, while moving alongside the barely remaining steel frame, they forcefully crawled up to the rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuii……arrival……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After reaching the summit, Shidou stretched and caught his breath while looking around at the scenery.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because of the field of view was higher than on the ground level, there was an even wider area visible now. He didn't know the exact time, but it seemed to be dawn. As the sky was burning red, the sun was peeked out half-way through a gentle curve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Superb view……maybe it's in poor taste to say. But……the scenery is amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka nodded in agreement to Shidou's impression. As she was bathing in front of the morning sun, it was so beautiful that it was almost breathtaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Ooh, that's right. I forgot something important."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Tohka clapped her hands as if remembering something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is important?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said as she looked down. And then after making a gesture of thinking up something in her head, she snapped her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, to match that sound, Tohka's body gave off a faint glow--her beaten down Astral Dress soon changed shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">It changed into a dark blazer with clear pleated folds on the skirt. A red ribbon decorated the white blouse. Near the chest, an emblem with the design of the letter R was glistening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou couldn't help but stare intensely at this. After all, this was the uniform of Raizen High School where Shidou currently resided.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because it's been a while--there may be little parts that I can only faintly recall. How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Tohka did a little spin. Her skirt fluttered in line with that movement.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because her skin and hair had still lost all its color, it gave an unusual feeling of being mismatched. But even with that, it was trivial matter compared to the sentiments filling Shidou's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, it looks good. The absolute best."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka gave off a slight bashful smile, bending her knees to also sit down on the rim of the rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Now, let's talk about your world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a brief reply, Shidou sat down next to Tohka. And then, he continued on while still looking at Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In return, please tell me stories about your world. To be honest, I'm very interested."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……? I don't mind, but the story of this world is not much more than what I said earlier--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said that while looking troubled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shook his head to refute that idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it. --The story of when I was alive in this world. Tell me the story of me, you, and everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Shidou's request, Tohka's eyes opened in surprise, letting out an energetic "umu!" while nodding her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Shidou also began to talk. The things that happened in his world.</p>
<p class="null-p">The day he met Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">The days spent with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">And--the moment when Tohka disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka listened to Shidou's story with great interest, but then widened her eyes at that last part.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I disappeared in that world? I see so--me as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka muttered, casting her eyes downward as if recalling what Shidou had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a mysterious sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou who had lost Tohka and Tohka who had lost Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such two people were talking side by side like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, as Shidou was smiling from this strange feeling, Tohka twisted her neck while keeping her arms folded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But……mu, there are some points I don't understand. Can I ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which points? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, what is Arubi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Tohka had asked, Shidou widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……the island we went to for the school excursion. Where I met Kaguya and Yuzuru……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu? Wasn't the school trip to Okinawa? There was an amazing food-eating showdown of sati andagi between Kaguya and Yuzuru. ……But it seemed that because I ate more than both of them, it ended up being a no-contest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I-Is that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied while thinking it over in his head. Certainly, the first planned site was Okinawa, but it was changed to Arubi became of DEM's interference.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, what we did at the Tenou Festival was a cat ear café rather than a maid café."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, so that was different too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu. The woman who isn't Shidou was very popular. Did you go on stage with cat ears too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damnit so that part wasn't different!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou involuntarily grabbed his head with his arms. Seeing this, Tohka giggled a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are many other things. For example--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka twirled her fingers as she searched through and recalled her memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">A story of Tohka and Shidou that was slightly different from Shidou's memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">While a parallel world, this world seemed to follow a slightly different path than Shidou's own world. Natsumi had transformed into Yuzuru instead, they confronted Nia with nurse outfits rather than bunny girl costumes, Origami used fur seals more often than soft-shelled turtles as an energy stimulant, and Shidou had transformed into Snow White in the fairy tale world. And--</p>
<p class="null-p">Whichever way it followed, Tohka loves Shidou and Shidou loves Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Eventually, the rising sun completely illuminated the earth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, he noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were tears falling down Tohka's cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-Tohka. What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah--no, that's not it. Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka rubbed her eyes with her uniform's sleeves, staring off into the horizon, looking at something far away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……But, I think that world's me is amazing. Helping Shidou, saving everyone, being able to play such an intensely vigorous role. Really……I can't compare at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">And with a sad voice, she whispered those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">For her to gaze at the view of this ruined earth was too heartbreaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou held a certain thought in his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……what's wrong, Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou called out her name, Tohka turned to him with a strange look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou breathed in--he uttered those words with determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why don't you come to our world?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's shoulder shook in astonishment. It was as if she was struck by thunder.</p>
<p class="null-p">But--she slowly shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……As you can see from the story just now, I'm different from the Tohka of that world. For me, I won't be able to replace your Tohka--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, staring into Tohka's eyes, said those words to intercept Tohka from continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think of you as a replacement for Tohka. Just for you as you--I want to help you as a Spirit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka looked like she was choking on her breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou added on a "besides" while scratching his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Most importantly, I……someday plan to meet Tohka again. When that time comes, if I regard you as a replacement for Tohka, how angry would Tohka be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Shidou had said, Tohka stared blankly with her eyes like a perfect circle--</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fu, haha, hahahaha--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, she started laughing as if not being able to contain it any longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What. You're not saying anything particularly ridiculous, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu……ah, that's right. --But, because I am a Spirit? In a world where</p>
<p class="null-p">Sprits are gone, is there any way to keep me in check if I go on a rampage?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if that ever happens--I, we'll, stop it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, you're making too light of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah, just a few hours ago, those words seems to reflect what we've done for someone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's words landed on a sore spot. After hesitation for a bit, Tohka coughed a few times to regain her composure before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But do you think such things will keep working repeatedly? ……Everyone was certainly amazing. But next time the following results may not be the same. Also, I was driven into that form from the despair of Shidou's death. If you were to die right in front of me--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying? Certainly, I don't have <Camael>'s healing ability anymore. But there are no more other Spirits, DEM has currently watered down, and no one is actively seeking my life. For accidents and illness, <Ratatoskr>'s 24 hour surveillance solves all but immediate death instantly! I can say with self-confidence that I'll be the hardest person to die on earth right now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Mu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka raised a groan while having a troubled look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-As expected, it's no good. I hurt everyone. It's too late to be able to face them anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, where the Spirits of this world the type of people to care about something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……but--"</p>
<p class="null-p">While this exchange was occurring--Shidou recalled already experiencing this strange feeling before.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was about two years ago. The evening of the day he first went on a date with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking closely at the nearby cityscape that she had only been destroying until now, Tohka regretted what she's done.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was worried that she shouldn't be in this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">For that Tohka, Shidou told her.</p>
<p class="null-p">--You can stay here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you reject yourself--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou reached out to Tohka just like at that time--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even more than that, I will accept you……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He yelled that out while looking into those eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to those words, Tohka choked a little and eventually looked down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fu. It's the first time I've been told that."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that in this world, Shidou had said something else. Even at this spot, Shidou could feel the difference between the Tohka standing in front of him and the Tohka held in his memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, from the expression of the Tohka that received that, her hesitation held until then had neatly disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Shidou. My mind is made. I--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka spoke while slowly opening her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I won't go to your world."</p>
<p class="null-p">What came out of Tohka's mouth were those clear words of rejection.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What is it? If there's still any issues--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou asked while making a sullen face. But, Tohka slowly shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it. I am very happy with your proposal. I can only imagine how wonderful it'll be to live with everyone again in that world. But……" Tohka sighed a little and got up from that spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--My world is here. Here is where I met Shidou, and here is where I lived. I can abandon this world where my memories of Shidou still remain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time Shidou let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking a few seconds to exhale for a while, Shidou raised his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see. Yeah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu……sorry. With that precious offer……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. --Perhaps, your version of me……would think the same."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka faintly smiled as she got up from that spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I can't take up too much of your time here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't get you involved in this world's problems anymore. Besides, you --aren't you planning on encountering that world's me again? If so, then there's not time to stop at a place like here."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, she raised her right hand to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Sandalphon>."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka summoned a golden great sword in her hands, creating a crescent shape scar in the empty space.</p>
<p class="null-p">The invisible walls that separated the worlds from each other. A slight gap had opened there. It was same as how Shidou arrived at this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Shidou was compelled to understand. The time for parting had arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka slowly turned back to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's you, you'll surely be able to meet again. I would know--I'm also Tohka too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Un, no doubt about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said those hopeful words with a broad smile, standing up to face Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Tohka said with a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Farewell, my friend. My best friend. I won't forget about you even for a lifetime."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. Me too. --Well then, Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">A goodbye that felt too light. It would be a lie to say there weren't any regrets.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou waved goodbye to Tohka in a very relaxed manner, and as he was about to throw himself into the empty space's scar--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">His feet were stopped by Tohka who suddenly extended out her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh--?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, he involuntarily rounded his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. After all, Tohka had grabbed his collar and pulled him towards herself, kissing him on the check as close as possible to the lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds, Tohka smiled as she lifted her lips off Shidou's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For continuation, do that with your Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was left dumbstruck, Tohka deeply smiled, pushing his body into that empty space's scar.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">At the next moment, what came into Shidou's view was neither a desolate earth nor a crumbling school building. But rather, it was a futuristic ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within the intense dizziness striking him from one beat after the other, he somehow managed to grasp his situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't upright. He was lying on his back after having posture pushed by Tohka. But strangely there wasn't any back pain. Even though there was the sensation of falling, it felt like his back had landed on a soft cushion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only after recognizing this, from Shidou's surroundings, there was a small groan coming from under him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Welcome back. Was it so bad that you had to immediately retreat?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following that voice, he turned over by rolling sideways. Over there, Kotori, who he thought was the one under him just now, was clutching her forehead while trying to stand up. Right now, she was wearing her crimson jacket over her shoulders rather than her Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">That wasn't all. Surrounding him, Origami, Nia, Kurumi, Yoshino, Mukuro, Natsumi, Kaguya, Yuzuru, and Miku, all of the former Spirit girls were there. A little further away, he could see Maria, Kannazuki, and the other crew members. Everyone seemed to be undergoing some sort of work, but now they were all staring blankly in surprise over Shidou's sudden entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It seemed Shidou was pushed into the empty space's scar, falling through the barrier between worlds and onto <Fraxinus>'s bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">A coincidence……it probably wasn't due to that. He didn't know if the parallel world Tohka took careful care sending him or if he was just automatically drawn here from a deep connection to this spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nushi-sama--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In just a few seconds, the girls likely grasped the current situation. His shoulders jolted as they rushed forward. Shidou greeted them with a gentle smile as he placed his hand against his forehead to suppress the dizziness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Looks like I made everyone worry. I'm home."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, the girls all said, 'welcome home' with a relieved expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after waiting for that to finish, Kotori stepped forward with a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--So, how was it Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slightly nodded while looking down.</p>
<p class="null-p">There would be so much to explain. Everyone would want to hear about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what he needed to say now didn't seem to be that. Suddenly smiling, he whispered those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was brief……but it was a good date."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">And so--</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon April arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">The clear spring weather was powerful enough to lure one to sleep for ten more minutes even after remembering that morning had arrived. At the very least, Shidou who overslept this morning, had set the challenge for receiving an allied Kotori and Mukuro attack on his bed. ……With the goal of waking up Shidou, the two of them killed their footsteps until arriving at the bed, ensuring a painful wake-up call once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, there was an ongoing investigation of the time where packaging tape and green foxtail were used, since it was an inhuman weapon that violated the Itsuka Household Sleep Protection Treaty. Additionally, the main culprit denied all charges, saying "Did you fall asleep and make a mistake?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, nevertheless, he still needed to thank them for making sure he was on time.</p>
<p class="null-p">On this day, this morning for the Itsuka household was busier than ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Okay, the bacon and egg paste is here. There is lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese over there. You can eat it as it is, or have it as a sandwich. Oh, the butter and jam is over here. If you want to toast it, the oven and toaster are both in order for use."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he said that, Shidou placed the plates with bacon and eggs on the table. Then, at the next moment, spoons and chopsticks from both sides snatched away the ingredients on the plates in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nuah! Nia-chan's crispy bacon!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kukaka! Sweet, there's nothing sweeter than Shidou's home cooked strawberry jam, Nia!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Preparations. Breakfast is on the battlefield. The results won't be realized until entering the mouth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't steal the bacon from under my bread!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, a fervent battle unfolded.</p>
<p class="null-p">It should be like this. The Itsuka household right now had Origami, Nia, Kurumi, Kaguya, Yuzuru, and Maria's interface body all lined up together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each day, the usual members would gather in the Itsuka household for dinnertime. But since during the morning there was school and work, this would usually be completed in their homes and it would be considered unusual for them to gather in here at this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inevitably, the breakfast was also needed in larger quantities than usual. So the original sandwich method was adopted where one could pair up their favorite ingredients with bread.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this plan had lit a fire in everyone's (chiefly the Yamai sisters and Nia) hearts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hey, please calm down and eat. There are still seconds to come."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that with a wry smile, Maria, while wearing an apron, nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Kaguya and Yuzuru, both of you are university students now, so please behave more like an adult. With no composure remaining, you'll end up looking just like Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what is Roboko implying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Maria, Nia grew angry at how easily understandable that was supposed to be.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru nodded to each other, correcting their postures while sitting down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry Yuzuru. I'll give you half the bacon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apology. Yuzuru was also in the wrong. Let's split the eggs halfway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why did everything completely tidy up now, Kaguyan Yuzurun!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Nia screamed, Kaguya and Yuzuru both laughed as they brought their handmade sandwiches to their mouths.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, Kaguya was too greedy for the ingredients, causing the majority of ingredients to slip out of the bread and back onto the plate. Looking at this, Yuzuru laughed as if she couldn't hold it in any longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, just like Maria, Origami and Kurumi, also dressed in aprons and assisted Shidou while carrying trays to the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have enough vegetables. Eat some salad as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's also the soup. That's my specialty."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, the soup and salad was also placed onto the table. The expression of Nia and the others brightened as they smacked their lips in anticipation for the cooking of those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, thank you for the help, Origami, Kurumi. You saved me the trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind. This is a matter of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. After all, I have to do this much to stand by Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami spoke quietly as Kurumi cheerfully spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them exchanged glances out of nowhere, staring intently for a few moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if trying to offer an olive branch, Maria spread out her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please calm down, both of you. At this stage where "thank you for the help" has been said, I must make it known that my collaboration work won't play second fiddle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't calm at all. Rather, this was heating up. Looking closely at the exchange of glances becoming a three-way struggle, Shidou gave a helpless bitter smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, as the living room door was knocked, everyone's gazes turned to that point.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that 'preparations' had been completed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the girls here now didn't come to the Itsuka household just for breakfast or for a heated battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">--They gathered to see a 'certain thing' performed here today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right. Come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened the door while saying that. From there, five girls entered in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ta-dah! We've arrived."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu……somehow, it's a little embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yeah, its super bad to get attention like this……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mufu. Isn't that fine? I longed for everyone to see this being worn."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Nii-sama and Origami-san also once looked like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, Yoshino, Mukuro, Natsumi, and Shidou's real little sister Mana.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of them were lined up and wearing the uniform for Raizen High School either proudly or bashfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Today on April 10th was the day of the entrance ceremony, where the five of them had become high school students.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, before heading to the school building, everyone had gathered early in the morning at the Itsuka household to try and show off their uniforms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, good, good. Everyone looks great!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, isn't that lovely. --Especially, Mana-san. It looks just like a schoolgirl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu……Raizen huh……everything about it feels nostalgic……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Identifying. Yuzuru and Kaguya were wearing that normally until two weeks ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone in the living room clapped their hands in applause while speaking. --The girls wearing the uniforms dyed their cheeks red as if looking bashful. Well, there were exceptions, like Mana who had a vein popping out over what Kurumi had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, how is it? Onii-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Kotori asked that while taking up a cute pose. Shidou nodded in approval as he stated his honest impressions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it looks great. I'm sorry I couldn't go to high school with everyone. Then, I could have boasted about have an adorable little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu……it's not too late now. Isn't your attendance missing a few days?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's cheeks were dyed in faint complexion as she mischievously spoke and smiled. It was like having mannerisms of both an innocent little sister and a mighty commander.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hey……please forgive me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou grinned. There were no lies in those words. If possible, he would like to avoid starting over from scratch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then--Origami's eyebrows twitched as she turned to look at the window. Shidou wondered what she was looking at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? What's wrong, Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something is coming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou curled his eyes over that statement; the next moment, the windows of the living room were opened up by someone invading.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaaaaaaa!? Is this the rumored paradise!? Greeted by angels in uniforms!? For the time being, let's have everyone surrounded me and play Oshikura Manju!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after noticing the mysterious shadow was Miku, she leaped after the girls wearing uniforms.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, rather than the end result arriving at the girls, the Yamai sisters caused Miku's legs to stumble from both sides, causing her to dive head first into the sofa. After that, Kotori's karate chop was delivered onto Miku's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, what are you doing right now? ……I mean, Miku didn't you have a job over there today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori asked that while folding her arms. Speaking of which, Miku's outfit was just a coat over a sparkling costume.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right. Miku eventually decided to head overseas and moved her base of operations to the United States this month.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Yes! But I have a little time until the next turn up, so I flew over at Mach speed! I couldn't miss out on everyone's uniform debut!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku gave a thumbs up while having an amazing look on her face. ……Yes, surprisingly despite going to the United States, the frequency of her visits to the Itsuka household hadn't changed much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria shrugged while letting out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would like you stop using the Realizer Manifestation Device on that small boat as a substitute for a taxi. That's supposed to be kept top secret."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, Maria-san. Thank you every time! Would a kiss be okay for the charge fee!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku twisted her body without any hint of malice. Maria let out a sigh once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……but in this case, there aren't much regrets for going overseas anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about Darling!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Miku turned around and suddenly pressed closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even when using the <Ratatoskr>'s small boat to travel, it still takes 15 minutes more than before! How much of a loss do you expect that in a year!? Anyway, Darling! Looking closer, your skin looks lovely! Can I rub it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I-I see……sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Pressed by a mysterious force, Shidou apologized for some reason. It was probably because of the end of that story suddenly getting derailed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this situation, Kotori smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm glad you were able to rush over even while being so busy. Hey, there, there."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kotori stroked Miku's head. Then, deeply moved, Miku let out a "Fuwa!" cry while shedding tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! K-Kotori-san! That's, don't mention it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku was crying out tears while embracing Kotori. However, her hand movements became so irritating that she immediately ate another karate chop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jeez……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori let out a heavy sigh, and then she turned as if to remind everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Now then, we'll have breakfast as well. We still have time, but we'll be late if we keep playing forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Kotori's voice, the first year high school students all took a seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, the dining room couldn't fit this number, so they had to use the living room table as well. Incidentally, Miku also had some time left, forcefully talking a seat between Natsumi and Mukuro with a cheerful look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Oh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, it was at this moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria slightly changed her expression and raised her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Maria."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--<Fraxinus>'s observation machine has detected a Reiha response. I think there shouldn't be any problems due to it being faint……for the time being, approval to confirm it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori knitted her brows at Maria's words. At the same time, there was also a hint of tension on everyone else's expressions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reiha response……wait, no way, it can't be <Beast>again……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi asked with sweat dripping down her cheeks. Then, Maria replied with an "of course".</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think irregularities like Spirits from other parallel worlds would appear this often. Moreover--didn't you say that she already regained her sense of self?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria spoke while turning her gaze to Shidou. Shidou deeply nodded his head forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, she's--Tohka is no longer rampaging anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Shidou, the girls all gave complicated looks.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>--parallel world Tohka's story was told to everyone immediately after Shidou returned to this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the other world, it seemed that Shidou had already died.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, who saw this, was trapped in despair and destroyed the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after regaining her sanity--she decided to stay in the other world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone had different reactions when they heard that, but what they all had in common was the feelings of nostalgia for Tohka--the desire to talk to her even if just a little after regaining her sanity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The bustling atmosphere just now unexpectedly turned solemn.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori coughed a little to brush away this mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. I still have time, so I'll go to <Fraxinus>just in case. Please go on ahead first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. But……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay with that? Mana and the others will accompany you if necessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori responded to everyone's concerns by waving her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Also, I don't want to start a school legend about being late to the entrance ceremony."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori joked while shrugging. Hearing that tone, everyone's expression's softened again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing, this Shidou breathed out to regroup his composure, raising his voice while looking at everyone's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, first off is the meal. --No matter what is done, we're powerless on an empty stomach."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu……that's certainly right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, in Tohka's case, it was a bit more extreme."</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone's cheeks relaxed. Shidou greatly nodded, clapping his hands together to let out a nice sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Itadakimasu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itadakimasu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lively voices resonated in the Itsuka household.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">A moist wind blew through the scarce earth as unevenly as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, staring at the horizon overlooking the sea, faintly shook her eyebrows. A subtle change, but the wind blowing against her cheeks was slightly warmer than a few days ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't confirm the exact date or time, but it must be springtime now. Well, the miraculous encounter regained the warmth in Tohka's heart--it may have been because of a nice reason such as that.</p>
<p class="null-p">--About roughly two weeks had passed since the secret date with the parallel world Shidou. Since then, Tohka had been traveling alone through the desolate earth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only two weeks. But there were plenty of discoveries. There were things that she didn't notice that filled the world when she lost her ego.</p>
<p class="null-p">The biggest discovery--was the existence of humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a world ravaged by a Spirit's power, many humans however still survived. Not to mention countries far away from Japan, even in the lands directly damaged by Tohka, she was able to confirm the existence of people who moved underground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back, when Tohka lost her ego, she tried not only to destroy the world, but also to kill every last human.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the world was bigger than what Tohka had thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Humans were more resilient that what Tohka had thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">The obvious fact made Tohka feel quite happy. When Tohka found survivors, she inadvertently shed tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, times had changed from when Spirits were an existence kept secret. Tohka's presence had become a symbol of fear across the entire world. Tohka couldn't stop shaking at that thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, like this, what should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka whispered softly while stretching in a single go.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she regained her ego. The moment she realized her sins. She thought she had to do something, even if crumbling away was the only chance for atonement.</p>
<p class="null-p">So at that time, she made a decision to not hold onto the hand of the parallel world Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, there must be something that could be done. There was plenty of time. First she needed to think it over--</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Ara, ara.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's been a while since last seeing you, but your face seems brighter."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, a sudden voice echoed, causing Tohka to turn around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Spread out there was a land of rubble with everything crushed. There was nowhere to hide. But even while so close, Tohka couldn't notice anything approaching until hearing that voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes--suddenly, the shadows on the ground extended outwards as a girl emerged out of there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's eyes widened while staring at the appearance of this women.</p>
<p class="null-p">A ghastly woman who wore a morning dress matching the shadows. The white hands peeping out from the collar made her black clothes all the more prominent. The entire face wasn't visible because of a jet-black parasol, but those thin lips clearly showed a suspicious smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those ominous looks caused her body to stiffen. As Tohka was trying to grasp these circumstances, the woman's smile grew deeper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, I'm honored to have place the strongest Spirit on such alertness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What the hell are you. A Shinigami……or maybe a messenger from hell?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka raised her eyebrows, breathing out that reply. --If truly the case, God must be extraordinarily attentive in carrying out self-mockery.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she laughed with a smile while slowly lifting up her parasol.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a bit painful to be called a Shinigami. In any case--please call me Angel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! You are--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka held her breath when looking at that face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Glossy black hair loosely gathered at her shoulders. A sharp face just like a counterfeit.</p>
<p class="null-p">--And also, the numerals of a clock engraved on her left eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">While the age was a little older than Tohka's memories, having this fragrant color and smell--there was no doubt about it. This was unmistakable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi--?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Tokisaki Kurumi. The girl once called the Worst Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this couldn't be true. Tohka's expression was dyed in a puzzled manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible, you must have died. No one else, myself……certainly, killed you."</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Tohka's words, Kurumi gave an amused smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you talking about? I am person with a face that often looks similar by chance. Who did you misunderstand me for?" "……! But, surely <Zafkiel>has become my 'sword'--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Halfway then, Tohka stopped talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">A sense of incongruity not felt when she had lost her ego. Among the Angels that had become her 'swords' <Zafkiel>had strangely weak Reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost as if--it was operating at half-power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Kihihi, hihi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Enjoying staring at Tohka's confusion, Kurumi leaked out her laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been waiting for a long time Tohka-san for you to regain your sanity.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Well, the one who came to rescue was a parallel world Shidou-san. …… That was indeed unexpected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka frowned in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Tohka-san. --Do you want to redo this world?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi narrowed her clock eye, smiling while saying that.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_22_15.jpg">
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Wha!? What wrong, commander, that look! Ha, could it be you've come to use me as seat for the high school entrance ceremony!? To use me to sit before the high school chairs! This is Kannazuki Kyouhei, at the peak of happiness! Now, by all means, use me to confirm the sitting comfort of that new uniform!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noisy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, landing a single blow on Kannazuki who let out a strange voice and fell onto <Fraxinus>bridge, walked around and sat at the captain's seat. Incidentally, there was pain, but Kannazuki leaked out a "thank you very much……" voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what is this response you're concerned about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori turned her eyes to the Maria that was on the bridge. It was a different body than the Maria that was at the Itsuka household earlier, but the same AI was controlling it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it is this."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Maria raised her right hand, a graph with detailed figures was displayed on the main monitor in line with that movement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Staring at this, Kotori frowned. By itself, it resembled what was observed before <Beast>appeared, but--responses that were widespread worldwide last month were now concentrated locally.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori looked at Maria with sweat dripping from her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What a faint reaction. This is, as if--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--The Spirit Formula itself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as such a voice came from behind, Kotori's shoulders trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking closely, she could tell that it was Origami and Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you here……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes rounded wide from the unexpected personal. Surely after breakfast Nia should have gone home and Origami should have gone to university.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, in particular, pushed against the teachers' opposition and fiercely decided to go to the same university as Shidou. It was unthinkable for someone like her to miss a chance to attend school together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, well, just to talk a little?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I, asked Nia for the details. I imagined it would be today……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori leaned her head at what Origami had said, but then immediately reconsidered and sharpened her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Rather than that, the words that couldn't be ignored had been uttered now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirit Formula. The forbidden work once done by the Magician Isaace Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">Collect and gather all of the mana in the world, the ultimate lifeform--the lost technology used to create a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Nia said, the response of the observer showed a wavelength very close to when that was performed.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Nia, who pointed that out, continued on without a sense of tension.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it should be safe though. It's a close to that wavelength, but it's probably a natural phenomenon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a natural phenomenon? So this flow of mana is occurring by coincidence and not by someone's will?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Kotori noticed. Maria, despite bringing her here, looked calm despite this unusual situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Maria. Did you also ask Nia something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's of poor reputation. Origami is one thing, but I can't stand being treated as an accomplice with Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that any different?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No comment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still don't understand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori irritatingly ruffled her hair and casted a sharp glance to Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Will you explain it properly? What the hell is going on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori asked while having a steep look, Nia muttered out a 'mu" while having her hand against her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, the expression is difficult. It's not a perfect coincidence. Speaking of will……it's not quite that. Who is different…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you want to force a name……it should be called 'the will of the world'."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Origami said that, Nia cried out "ah, that's the feeling, that's the feeling" while pointing with her finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Are you kidding?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori sharpened her gaze, Nia shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not something I would joke about. But you know, <Rasiel>can teach anything, but it's the head that has to understand that. It's sad to say, but even I don't fully understand this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori frowned at Nia's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Nia. What do you know? At that time, didn't you search information about <Beast>through <Rasiel>?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Yeah? About Bea-chan. But, I don't know. Why did she appear in this world in the first place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that being said, a question mark filled Kotori's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, it was an important issue. The reason why irregularities like Spirits from a parallel world appear in this world--if there is such a thing to be made clear, unless it is removed, the threat may come back to this world again.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, what was obtained so far was what Shidou had heard from parallel world Tohka, only a vague 'sense of being called upon'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I can't think up another good expression, I'll make do with the assumption that it's the 'will of the world'……that means, it's been doing a job for over a year now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Job?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Once an existence has fallen apart, to be able to return to the original form with the same configuration without any differences--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! That means--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than a simple structure, it's difficult because the completed form would be immensely complexed and outrageous. Even for something described as the will of the world, it would be an extremely laborious task. Hundreds of years……a huge job that could take thousands or tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p class="null-p">--So, the will of the world worked out a plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sending a passionate love call to a parallel world with a being as close to the goal as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, as long as it's described as a parallel world, it's not the exact same as the target. But at that moment, in this world there was an existence with 'living blueprints as close to the target as possible'. --Don't you think that would shorten the work process?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori took a deep breath while placing her hand on her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">From tension or excitement, she felt her heart beat a little faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">After standing up from the captain's seat, Kotori walked towards a crew member seat on the left.</p>
<p class="null-p">The analytic seat where no one was sitting. There was now a stuffed bear full of patchwork left behind by the owner of that seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The will of the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami and Nia described this existence in a vague and roundabout way.</p>
<p class="null-p">But why? When listening to that story, Kotori's mind recalled a certain figure.</p>
<p class="null-p">An excellent engineer and Kotori's subordinate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once a peerless close friend that was always by her side.</p>
<p class="null-p">--And a certain woman that became mana and melted into world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Really, what a troublesome person."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whispering that at the same time as embracing that stuffed bear, something feeling warm traveled down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Making rattling sound, the cherry blossom blizzard soared into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou leaked out his admiration to the unexpected superb view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Wow, it's in full bloom."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lightly brushing aside the cherry blossoms that fell on his bag and shoulders, he resumed his walk. The soft sunshine pouring in-between the trees uplifted his spirits and made him pick up his pace.</p>
<p class="null-p">This week was university orientation. In short, a lecture for explaining lectures for the upcoming school year as well as the hands-on experiences classes. Courses and required courses that interested him, the percentage of credits needed for promotion/graduation, he needed to select a good balance of both. Actually, he wanted to consult Origami who went to the same university as him. But for some reason, she had an important task to do and asked him to go on ahead.</p>
<p class="null-p">The road Shidou was walking had a row of cherry blossoms along the river. Cherry blossoms lined up side-by-side, the flowers in full bloom formed a natural arch.</p>
<p class="null-p">This landscape however wouldn't last long. Today is April 10th. He had heard that the blooming process was slower than usual, but the flowers will still fall over the course of next week.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt a little lonely, but it was also inevitable. If the flowers fall, the leaves become cherry blossoms. Then as the cherry blossom scattered, buds will grow from the branches again. It spun a continuous cycle of reincarnation that continuously repeated up to now. Next year, they'll be able to see these beautiful flowers again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"April 10th……huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Within the light pink veil, Shidou whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. April 10th.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today's date held a special meaning for Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Two years ago today, Shidou met a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Terrifyingly beautiful, but also innocent and with something missing--a girl who was nobler and stronger than anyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, she left behind various things to Shidou--</p>
<p class="null-p">Then without even waiting for whole a year, she disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Haha."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that in mind, Shidou unintentionally laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">When remembering again, Shidou had spent less than a year with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, but for that year.</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to the life lived until then, it was full of surprises, hardships, and above all else brilliance that made it feel never short.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no exaggeration to say that Shidou's entire life completely changed from before and after meeting her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of meeting, he was his current self.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of her, everyone is here.</p>
<p class="null-p">For Shidou, for everyone, she was that much special.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou suddenly smiled when looking over the scenery again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Come to think of it, he once brought her here.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's true, right on the day where she disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">She, her sister, the three of them came to see the cherry blossoms together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back to it, the cherry blossoms then were in full bloom just like today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment. A stronger breeze passed through the area, both the flowers still on the trees and those falling onto the ground flashily fluttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">A pale-colored curtain covered his sight. Suddenly, Shidou unintentionally closed his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Amazing wind--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">With his eyes slightly opened, he stopped talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">The long, long, cherry blossom road.</p>
<p class="null-p">Beyond that. Just in front of Shidou, not until just now the figure of a person stood there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at that figure, Shidou involuntarily opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Long night colored-hair that shined on the light pink background.</p>
<p class="null-p">A pair of crystal-like eyes that projected an illusory color.</p>
<p class="null-p">A violently beautiful face, but also one that made up a soft expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--You, are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Within his semi-consciousness, Shidou spilled out those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wondered why? If meeting her, he would need to ask--somewhere in his head; it felt like he understood to do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Name, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, this girl, understanding of this for a long time and also looking as if she had directed those words for herself already, replied back as her entire face expressed a smile.</p>

<p class="null-p">"--My name is Yatogami Tohka. An important name given to me by a important person. --Isn't that nice?"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">(※Includes spoilers for the main story. Please be careful for those having not read yet.)</p>
<p class="null-p">It's been nine years since the first Date A Live volume was released on March 19, 2011.</p>
<p class="null-p">The volume completing the original story, 'Date A Live Volume 22 Tohka Good End Second Half', has been delivered.</p>
<p class="null-p">What did you think? If this series can leave the slightest aftertaste in your mind, then there is no better joy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Long time no see, this is Tachibana Kōshi. Date A Live, which I have been working on for a long time, is also complete.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to everyone's support, it has become a long-running series that has far surpassed the expectations at the beginning of the project. Also, I was able to have several developments in a few manga serializations, anime, game, theatrical release, spin-offs, and etc. It's possible to say it's an extraordinarily blessed series.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is also thanks to the various people participating and the readers involved with 'date'. On this occasion, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tsunako-san. Thank you for the longest time. Without Tsunako-san's illustrations, 'date' couldn't have been completed. For Spirits, mecha, plain clothes, orders without moderation, we always received the best work. I ran through the original work feeling embarrassed by Tusnako's illustrations. Really, thank you very much. Thank you for the feedback every time. It's always encouraging.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kusano-san. Impressions of the world of 'date' through the original work, anime, and advertisements, it's no exaggeration to say that it was shaped from Kusano-san's good taste. Every time I received a cool and stylish cover design, I was excited. Thank you for the best job.</p>
<p class="null-p">Person in charge. Thinking about it, we've been socializing since winning the award, so it is about to be 12 years this year? The other author of date is you. Thank you very much. Sorry for always pulling along the manuscript. I'll do my best for the next work, so I'll be blessed if we can keep working together for a while now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Higashide-san. NOCO-san. Cool writing style × Cool illustration = strongest. Thank you for the wonderful spin-off. I'm really looking forward to the anime.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also to the many people involved in 'date', manga artists, illustrators, animation staff, cast, game staff, figures and goods productions, editing, distribution, and bookstores, etc. And also you who are holding this book right now. Really, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami. You were initially a heroine with the role of the bad guy. For that reason, you may have suffered a lot early on. However, your point of view, which should be another leading role, was very helpful in writing the story. And above all, it was fun writing about you. And after passing the greatest hills in the first half, volume 10 and volume 11, you have become a great heroine. It was really nice to write about you. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia. Although you were a late player in the Spirit group, surprisingly everyone got use to you in an instant. You are cheerful, active, nerd-savvy, and a meta-speaker. I can't imagine a short story without you anymore. Sorry for using personal punchlines so often. I'm always being saved. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi. You, summoned from my high school notebook, were in the some ways the oldest character. And above all else, you are a character that has surpassed my imagination. Now, I can't talk about 'Date A Live' without you. Also, I've received a lot of care from your figurine and promotional goods. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino. And also Yoshinon. You who appeared in the second volume were important characters who changed the 'dot' indicated by Tohka into a 'line'. My oasis when I was in the dire distress of fumbling with a new series. And above all else, at the end of the story, I was surprised displaying your amazing growth and great efforts. It's no exaggeration to say that you are the MVP of volume 20. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori. You are a meritorious person who has supported this series from the beginning to the end. Without you, this story wouldn't have been completed. Often in the position of becoming the viewpoint character, it could be described as the character closest to the author. And that meant having to make various painful decisions. Sorry. You being here was a great help. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro. Because you appeared last among the Spirits, you were less likely to appear than the other characters, but still a splendid presence was shown among them. A character with numerous attributes to compete with the existing characters, but the most impressive thing was your purity. Just from your presence, every scene became gentle. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi. You feel like a character I love to make at my own selfishness. You don't like your negative self, but let's confess my pen was at its best when writing your point of view. The character that can easily play an active role in short stories along with Nia. She shined even more by gaining a friend name Yoshino and a natural enemy named Miku. I wish you all the happiness from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya. You were supposed to be a chunnibyou character, but before one knew it, that was tampered and you just became a character often toyed with. That was a nice miscalculation. It was really nice to be able to write about yours and Yuzuru's past. Sorry for using you like Crocodine. But it was of great help. When hearing you say, "Somehow why are my comments different from everyone else!?" that facet is also very endearing. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru. If Kaguya was meant to be 'dynamic', then you were set up to be a 'static' character, but unexpectedly more natural than Kaguya, you ended being a carnivorous character. That was also a nice miscalculation. A good teacher was met. Finally, it was nice to be able to show off Kazamachi Yamai. I think the loveliness shown on your date with Shidou is your characteristic quality. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku. Unexpected changes and growth are common. But among that, yours was surprising. At first hated, but before one noticed you became a beloved character. Incidentally, the person-in-charge likes you the most. Usually a monster, it was very cool how you also became a sempai character. I hope I can listen to your song again. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka. 'Date A Live' started with you. This story was born because you were there. I was on this long journey because you were there. Finally, to see your smile, I was able to write a 22 volume story. Not only fun times, there will surely be many difficulties waiting in the future. But I believe you'll keep smiling till the very end. With Shidou, with everyone, may happiness be blessed for many years to come. Really, thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mayuri. The theatrical release was a lot of fun. Due to the length and setting, there were little interactions and dialogue with Shidou, but your last words still remain in my heart. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinne. When talking about the game, you were born as an original heroine made with all my strength. I really think you became a memorable character. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria. And also MARIA. You who came from the beginning of the story, I really didn't think you be able to appear in this manner. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Marina. At first you were a villain, but then played an unexpected role. Your ending in Rio Reincarnation was my hope. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rio. Many characters have been saved because of you. It's difficult to get involved in the main setting. But I won't forget. There was a certain world where you were born. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ren. Not much to talk about since your game isn't released yet. But one thing. Thank you very much for a story that could only be possible because of you. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mio. In a sense, 'Date A Live' was the story of your love. In fact, at the beginning, the story was going to end at your story. But that wasn't the case. Three volumes about the story of the Spirits were born. Your daughters have surpassed you. I was really happy to be able to depict your story. Please be happy with Shinji. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine. I'll count you separately from Mio. Your services were hidden in the story. Supporting Kotori, helping Shidou, and guiding everyone. Even if the root of it was your own desires, your presence was a source of trust for everyone. You may deny it yourself, but you were gentler than anyone else. Surely, until those last moments. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana. Your presence had a very important role in adding depth to the story. I'm sorry you had a difficult life. But you're also the leading handsome character in the story. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenka. At first you should have been a ruthless character, but before one could noticed, you became an imoto-worried older sister character. Surely, thanks to you, Tohka was happy. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Parallel World Tohka. You will surely be able to grasp the future that you want. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen, Westcott, Woodman, Karen. The story began thank to you all. The best villains and the reliable superiors respectively. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki, Shiizaki, Kawagoe, Nakatsugawa, Minowa, Mikimoto. Thanks to our support, Shidou was able to go on those dates. Sorry for letting you choose strange options. Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan, Tonomachi, Ai, Mai, Mii. You all were a symbol of the everyday life. Thank you for constantly staying by with Tohka and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko, Mikie, and Milly. Thank you for always protecting Tenguu City.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shinji, Artemisia, <Nibelcole>, Tatsuo, Haruko, Jessica, Paddington,</p>
<p class="null-p">Andrew, Ashley, Cecil, Leonora, Minerva, Murdoch, Kanon, Hiyori, Nagisa,</p>
<p class="null-p">Asahi, Subaru, Ririko, Robo Origami. And to all the characters not written here, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Shidou. At the beginning of this project, you were a colorless character. But while writing the story, and as the story progressed, you became more and more colored. Your presence is a must. You are my best friend I would admire. Surely, you will be able to firmly walk forward to in a future not depicted in this story. Many blessings to the destination of your future. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it's been a lengthy but short postscript, but now its curtain time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The main story is over, but 'date' isn't over yet. 'Encore' continues and an animation for 'Date A Bullet' is also underway.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the production of a sequel anime series for 'Date A Live' has also been decided! I'm looking forward to meeting again with the anime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, thank you very much!</p>
<p class="null-p">March 2020</p>
<p class="null-p">Tachibana Koushi</p>
