<p class="null-h1">Chapter 6: The One Struggling</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..err, are you done yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Itsuka Shidou twitched his shoulders when a timid voice called out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems Shidou dozed off for a while. When he looked towards the direction of the voice, he found out that the small girl wearing glasses----Teacher Okamine Tamae AKA Tama-chan was holding the memo towards Shidou while making a troubled expression. It looks like she couldn't move because Shidou was looking at it with a very serious look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Y-Yes…..Thank you….very much"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, he took a small bow before reverting back his posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, it was only natural for Shidou to have his eyes stolen by the memo.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. The date written there----was a date 5 years before [Today].</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou gulped to wet his throat, he looked at his surroundings once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">From what he could see, the buildings were slightly arranged different from his memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">The different seasonal scenery from just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also------Tama-chan-sensei does not know of Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those factors slowly back up the unbelievable information written on her memo.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I will be leaving now okay……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan tilted her head while asking. Shidou, who was immersed in thought while his eyebrows were closer, widen his eyes in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah…….Sorry and thank you"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Tama-chan twisted her head in wonder while leaving the place.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing her move away, he leaned his back against a fence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..5 years ago? You've got to be kidding me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou pressed his forehead and groaned. There was a conflict occurring in his head because of his common sense trying to laugh off this absurd situation, and the various proofs shown in his view were colliding.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's normal. Time is unalterable and inviolable. It's impossible for a time that passed to return back once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou could not deny that fact.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was one possibility scratching his mind. Right before Shidou came to this world, he encountered a certain girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuru-mi-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">After squeezing out that name from his dry throat, Shidou vividly recalled back that girl in his mind. She has unbalanced eyes, black hair, and white skin decorated with a crimson black dress. She also has a clock dial on her left eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi. Tokisaki Kurumi. The name of the worst unsealed Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">She has an Angel known as <Zafkiel>. Its ability---was controlling time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each of the clock-shaped Angel's numbers had different abilities and by pouring the shadow coming from the number into her pistol, she can choose to accelerate, decelerate or even stop her target's time.</p>
<p class="null-p">And right before he came to this world, Shidou got shot twice by Kurumi's bullet.</p>
<p class="null-p">He pat his unwounded forehead while gulping.</p>
<p class="null-p">The existence of the Spirit and Angel, which are out of the realm of reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her powers, it might be possible----</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Kihihihi"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus. When Shidou was immersed in thought, he could hear a small laugh coming from somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-Who is it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, this is sad. Have you already forgotten about me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gulped when he heard that voice and tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way…..Kurumi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. Ufufu, I am glad you realized that"</p>
<p class="null-p">The owner of the voice----Kurumi, continued talking. It was a weird feeling. He could hear her voice clearly even though he couldn't see her anywhere. It's felt as if an invisible person was whispering into his ears or maybe, tiny people settled down inside his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">He quickly looked to the right and left. However, he could not see any human shadows anywhere nearby. Kurumi giggled maybe because she felt that Shidou's state was funny.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, doing that is meaningless.----That's because, I am currently in a different [time] from Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped after hearing Kurumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">[That] was the possibility that overheated Shidou's mind just now but, now that he was told this again, he could feel a strong squeeze on his heart. The feeling of getting lost into this unknown world and an indescribable anxiety spread out inside him.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, after Shidou managed to fix his wild breathing, he threw his words to Kurumi, who he has no idea where she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I thought-----This is Tenguu city from 5 years ago…….right?" "Oh my"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi let out an expected voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You already found out [When] that place is? Ufufu, as expected from (of) you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………I was just lucky. More importantly------mind giving an explanation?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou brought his eyebrows closer and said that, Kurumi replied back with a [Yes].</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like what you thought, I sent Shidou-san back to Tenguu City from 5 years ago.-----That is the power of [Yud Bet12th bullet]; Zafkiel's last bullet"</p>
<p class="null-p">"[Yud Bet12th bullet]…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely, it's one of the abilities <Zafkiel>owns. He recognizes that it's an Angel with immense powers but, he never would have imagined that this was possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, the reason why I am able to talk to Shidou-san now, is also because of <Zafkiel>'s power. The [9th bulletTet]. It's a bullet that allows me to connect to a person's thoughts in a different time axis. -----well, it's a bullet I don't use a lot so I'm not used to it and it takes some effort to connect my thoughts"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Connecting……your thoughts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Obviously for talking to you, I am able to share what Shidou-san hears and see too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………it doesn't feel good though"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked down before closing and opening his hands. Is this scene being transferred to Kurumi too? ………it feels like a remote control robot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, with that said, please refrain yourself from actions that no one can say (speak about). I don't mind it at all though"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I won't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He shouted back in reflex to Kurumi's joke. A girl coincidentally walking past him quickly passed by Shidou with a look as if she was looking at a suspicious person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An-anyway. Hurry up and send me back to my time! I have no time for this farce! Right when I am doing this, the girls are…..!</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted while clenching his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Shidou has to go back to his time as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now in the Tenguu city of his original time, a great disaster was attacking. Countless beams were shot down from an inversed Origami, who suddenly appeared in the sky and was messing up the whole city into rubble.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, the Yamai sisters, and Miku were trying to stop Origami while Yoshino and Natsumi headed into the city to save the people in the city. Adding on to the problem, <Fraxinus>got shot down by Origami when it came to help Shidou, starting with Kotori and the crew, he had no clue about their welfare. In that situation, Shidou, who has the power to seal a Spirit's Reiryoku was not present.</p>
<p class="null-p">Imagining the problems occurring at his world was not hard at all. "Well-----That's true; it's terrible on this side. It's only scorched earth from what I can see. No matter how hell looks, it probably doesn't look as gruesome as this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….! Then hurry up and-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">However. Kurumi made a sigh as if she was fully aware of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, are you okay with that? Returning back to your time without doing anything. I even went through all the trouble and sent you back to the past with <Zafkiel>'s secret of secret-[Yud Bet12th bullet]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..? What…….do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without understanding what Kurumi said, Shidou groaned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like what it means.------If Shidou-san wants to fix that despair-like situation, the only way is to do something about the Origami-san of 5 years ago"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, what…….? Wai-wait just a second. I don't get you. Well, obviously Origami is here too but, she's an elementary school student 5 years ago right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you're wrong. The Origami-san you will be meeting will the one that has already turned into a Spirit.-----I should have sent her back 5 years ago with my [Yud Bet12th bullet]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out his inner voice in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami……to this time!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There is still some time left since I sent Shidou-san further up the past so, she hasn't appeared yet, I will send her there after a while"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is going on? Why did you send Origami back 5 years……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To kill her parent's killer. More specifically-----to kill the enemy before she became the [Killer]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt his heart get squeezed each time Kurumi talked.</p>
<p class="null-p">The information in his head reached one intersection point.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago, Origami's parents got killed by a Spirit. Origami gained the power transcending human knowledge. And-----Kurumi's [Yud Bet12th bullet].</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did Origami…………come back to defeat <<Phantom>…………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago. Shidou mumbled while recalling back the other Spirit at the fire disaster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, then why is Origami inversed when she came back to the original time! Just what the hell happened in this time!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That……………even I have no idea. In order to find and stop that----I shot [Yud Bet12th bullet] at you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou placed his hand on his chest to suppress his heartbeat which was pumping wildly from just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Look into Origami's movements who came back 5 years, pinpoint the reason for her inverse and fix that problem. If what Kurumi says is correct, that seems like the only way.</p>
<p class="null-p">However-----there was still one thing he doesn't get. Shidou sharpen his sights as if to glare at the invisible girl while moving his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Kurumi. If what you say is correct, then why are you doing this? Not only me. You got asked from Origami to send her back 5 years in the first place right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That was the part that he doesn't understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within a Spirit's outside reason, Kurumi was especially a different existence. It's true that Shidou was saved by Kurumi once before but, that was because it was within her interests too. It's unbelievable to think that she would use her Angel for someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Kurumi made a moment of silence before replying back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't particularly have any benefit……………….is that what you mean? I don't have many chances to test shot [Yud Bet12th bullet] with someone else Reiryoku anyway. But………..let's see"</p>
<p class="null-p">After exhaling, Kurumi continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In a force attempt to put it into words; I just wanted proof"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Proof? What proof?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----The fact that humans can change history"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's tone when she said that was a little different from her usual joking tone and Shidou gulped when he heard that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Change history……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I wanted to see it. I wanted to see if she could turn this hopeless destruction and tragedy, into something that never happened"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That…….is it possible for me? I heard that history………has something lik correction powers too but……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said it with a difficult face. It's not like he was knowledgeable about SF but, he heard of that theory before when he saw a time leap movie last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, after returning back to the past with a time machine, even if a huge event that might change history occurred, a similar event will correct that change and form a world similar to the original history.</p>
<p class="null-p">But. Kurumi laughed at Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was a weird thing you said, Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">A charming breath echoed in Shidou's mind. If Kurumi was here, then she would've definitely lift Shidou's chin provocatively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who was the one that proposed that? Did that person actually demonstrated time travel?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-that's………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how big the world is, Tokisaki Kurumi is the only person that can interfere with irreversible time. And also this <Zafkiel>. Please don't lend your ears to nonsense made by smart scholars and authors. The thing you-Shidousan looking right now, is the only truth"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said it with a plain tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's as if she was telling that to herself instead of Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….it looks like I talked too much. Even though I shot [Yud Bet12th bullet] with time to spare, you can't stay there for too long. Let's begin the operation"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi regained her composure and talked. Shidou clenched his teeth before swinging his head vertically.</p>
<p class="null-p">There are many things still in the unknown. But, in order to stop Origami from inversing and save the city from turning into hell, it's certain that this was the only way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…..let's go, Kurumi"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Shidou lifted his face and turned the direction of his toes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's goal is to defeat the Spirit that killed her parents. And that Spirit is most likely----<Phantom>. If that is the case then, it should be appearing at the Tenguu Nankou town which was the place of the fire disaster.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched his fist to make up his mind and ran to the destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">He doesn't know the exact time but, the sun was already setting. However, Shidou's body was burning without him knowing that the summer sun has become weak. Each time Shidou moved his hands and legs, sweat will flow out and would mercilessly take away his stamina.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou didn't stop. He had no idea how long he can stay in this age (time)----and more importantly, the girls were working hard in his original time so, he couldn't just stand still and do nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">After running for how long, Shidou reached a familiar place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nankou, town……"</p>
<p class="null-p">His speed gradually fell and he mumbled the name of the city in between his wild breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It was the scenery of Tenguu Nankou town before it was covered in flames.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a weird feeling. His emotions were slightly shaken by nostalgia when he saw the city he used to live in.</p>
<p class="null-p">And---at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain discovery stopped Shidou's legs by reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something wrong, Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi asked him suspiciously. However, Shidou couldn't reply her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene in front of Shidou, it was one house.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a double story house with a characteristic deep red roof. It wasn't really that special that it would attract someone's eye but………….the moment Shidou saw it, he couldn't move as if he got paralyzed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the house Shidou lived in 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, the house itself wasn't the reason why Shidou stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he saw it, one thought grazed his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago. Shidou was currently at Tenguu city from 5 years back. It was the day, Origami lost her parents to a Spirit and she vowed to kill that Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that wasn't the only thing that occurred 5 years ago. At that moment Origami saw her parent's killer, the city was covered in flames.</p>
<p class="null-p">---It was the flames caused by Shidou's sister, Itsuka Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said this. She told me to come in contact with Origami, who came back 5 years and make the inverse [Never happened].</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou accidentally thought it. Then…..it might be possible to turn the fact that Kotori turned into a Spirit, into something that [Never Happened].</p>
<p class="null-p">If Kotori is at home right now, he wondered if he could tell her not to go to the park today along with staying away from the spot where she encountered <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment that thought passed his mind, Shidou's legs unconsciously moved in front to his house.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was faint memories but, 5 years ago on August 3rd; Shidou should have gone out to the city to buy a birthday present for Kotori. There was no chance for meeting his old self here. In a familiar manner, Shidou opened the gates and walked to the house's back door after passing the garden.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the nameplate with the word [Itsuka] was reflected onto his eyes. At that point, Kurumi guessed Shidou's actions. She then said it with a little stronger tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san, I understand your feelings but, please give up on Kotori-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't plan on neglecting Origami……! But----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is not it. If Kotori's never became a Spirit; even you know what kind of influence will happen 5 years later after [That moment]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….! Ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes when he was told that.</p>
<p class="null-p">The possibility that Kotori wouldn't have to turn into a Spirit blinded his eyes and he didn't think about it. If Kotori did not become a Spirit----<Ratatoskr>wouldn't have found her.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that happens; <Ratatoskr>wouldn't know that Shidou has sealing abilities and the fact that the powers of Tohka, Yoshino, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku and Natsumi were sealed would [Never happened]. That was something that must be avoided at all cost.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou grinded his teeth before swinging his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Sorry. Looks like blood rushed up to my head"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. The possibility to fix the past is a poisonous high-grade wine that will cause people to go crazy. I don't blame Shidou-san for that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said it with an understanding tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slightly brought his eyebrows closer. Just like just now, he could not feel any self-admonition included in Kurumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it's only natural once he thought about it. The possibility to change the past. That is something anyone would wish for. Shidou could not even begin to imagine what kind of anguish and thoughts Kurumi, who has this authority, had until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kurumi, you-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Shidou was about to talk to Kurumi, he could hear a voice coming from the back door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-san, it's Suzumoto from next door"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou twitched his shoulders when a voice suddenly appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not here I wonder………..lets go in and check"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, the sound of the door opening could be heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Suzumoto-san, who used to live next door 5 years ago. She would often share vegetables sent over from the countryside but…..now that he think about it, he had memories of her often placing vegetables at the front of the back garden when Shidou and his family wasn't around.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was thankful to her for doing that but, the timing now was just plain terrible. That's because right now, it the 5 years later high-school Shidou instead of the elementary school Shidou. He looks like an intruder from all angles. If he was reported to the police then it would consume much of his precious time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-what am I going to do……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzumoto-san's footsteps were slowly approaching when he was doing that. Even though he looked around in panic, there was no place to hide. There was nothing to be done.</p>
<p class="null-p">---and at that moment. A certain idea grazed Shidou's anxious mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Oh my?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The housewife next door-Suzumoto Naoko stepped into the Itsuka house's back garden and found one boy there.</p>
<p class="null-p">He's probably in upper-level elementary school. His neuter and cute face was characteristic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh Shidou-kun, you were here. Sorry. Nobody came when I rang the doorbell"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………n-no! It's my fault for missing it……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">The eldest son of this family-Itsuka Shidou said it while making an uncomfortable smile for some reason. Naoko twisted her head in wonder before handing over the plastic bag she was holding to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This was sent over from the countryside and if it's okay with you all, go ahead and eat it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-thank you very much. It's really helpful"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou accepted the plastic bag and took a bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………A-ra?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, is there something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's just that Shidou-kun's atmosphere is different from usual?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? N-no, I don't think that's true though………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Uuuun………it was my imagination I guess………….well forget it. Give that to your mom okay"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thank you very much"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naoko heard Shidou's voice while exiting the Itsuka house's garden. "………..Haaa"</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing Suzumoto-san leave the garden, Shidou made a big sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, that was a good idea, Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………aah, I'm glad it worked out nicely"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Kurumi said that, he replied back while wiping off his sweat. After he did that, he found out that his hand that he used to wipe off his sweat with was smaller than his usual hand in his memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't only his hand. His torso, legs and even the clothes covering his body has turned small.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. When Shidou was about to be seen by his neighbor, the thought that grazed his mind was the other Spirits turned into children when Natsumi used her Angel <Haniel>that occurred once before.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Shidou was an elementary school student, it wouldn't be weird for him to be there. And, Shidou already sealed Natsumi's reiryoku. Then, it was possible for him to try this out………….unlike Tohka's <Sandalphon>or Yoshino's <Zadkiel>, but, he somehow managed to make it work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I wasted some time. Let's go"</p>
<p class="null-p">After placing the plastic bag he just received on the edge of the garden, Shidou talked to Kurumi before pouring strength into his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….hnn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No……….how do I revert back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou frowns his eyebrows while sweat was flowing down his cheeks. It's because he suddenly transformed, he has no clue on how to turn back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, that is a problem. You have to head over to Origami-san now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn………..I have to revert back somehow or……."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou closed his eyes and groaned, Kurumi leaked a giggle in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san, before you turn back, can you please stand in front of a mirror just once?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't see Shidou-san face, which turned cute from this angle"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou half-opened his eyes while making a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">But----at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky suddenly glow red and Shidou immediately turned over to that direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Opposite the well-ordered (organized) house roofs, a giant fire pillar soared and at that moment, it dispersed mid-air and attacked the whole area nearby with a wave of scorching heat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The whole city was wrapped in flames instantly; trees and houses were burning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Several screams and shouts appeared nearby and the citizens started evacuating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……Kotori's!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems, that is the case"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi replied to Shidou's question. Shidou clenched his teeth in regret. It seems, Kotori has already gone to that park.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now, Kotori was turned to the Spirit <Efreet>by <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou could not stand still anymore and ran from the spot. His body was still small but, he couldn't ask for any luxury. Kotori turning into a Spirit means that <Phantom>is there-----meaning that, Origami will travel through time to go to that place.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the group of citizens evacuating and destroyed houses from the flames was blocking the road making it hard for him to advance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou searched his memories from 5 years back to find an alternative road; and somehow managed to reach that particular park.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….! That's------"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Shidou reached that park. There were already 3 people there.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of them was a young crying Kotori. Another was Shidou from 5 years ago, lying on the ground face first.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-----a noise-like [Something] was standing there looking down at the both of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Phantom>……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, the moment Shidou called that name.</p>
<p class="null-p">A beam poured down from the sky and erased <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt sparks in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Shidou knows this scene. 5 years ago, it's true that <Phantom>was shot by a beam from the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou immediately looked up. He looked up at the direction of the source of the beam.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, he recognized a person there.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a beautiful girl covered with a magical white dress with several [Wings] accompanying her. However, her face right now looked frightening because of anger and hatred.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted in reflex. Yes, over there, was the Spirit-Tobiichi Origami who travelled through time to come here.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was still a mystery on how Origami turned into a Spirit. However, Origami was still not an inverse-type yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely----it was going to occur now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami will turn, by an event that caused that firm girl stand into the abyss of despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Up in the sky with Origami, <Phantom>who had just disappear could be seen with her there. Most probably, it dodged Origami's attack and ran to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Origami swung her hand, the [Wing] surrounding Origami shot beams towards <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a signal, both of them started flying in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san, please follow her. You will lose her like this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-aah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickly replied to Kurumi's words and started running into the burning city to follow them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami repeatedly shot beams to attack <Phantom>but, <Phantom>dodged all of them and it seems that it wasn't countering back. Just like a game of tag, it flew around everywhere in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami! Origami! It's me! Listen! You have to stop now, if this goes on you will-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou desperately shouted at them while chasing them but, there was no response at all. However, that was natural. Not only were they far apart, she was right now in front of her sworn enemy who she has been continuously targeting her growing grudge at.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he can't just give up because of that reason. He desperately chased after the 2 while shaking his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami! Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami!" And.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stopped and looked back at the ground when he heard a sudden voice other than his echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there was a male and female, thought to be a couple. Most likely, they ran out from their burning house. Both of their clothes were dirty and several small wounds could be seen on them.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, Shidou wondered why they called Origami's name but-----he immediately knew the reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the direction that they were facing, an elementary school girl could be seen there.</p>
<p class="null-p">She has a hairstyle around shoulder length and a smart face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes………that's Origami from 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Father, Mother--------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami shouted, with tears at the side of her eyes from the happiness of knowing that her parents were safe.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, immediately afterwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt his view turned pure white.</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards, a strong impact attacked nearby, and Shidou's body easily got blown away since it turned small.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slammed towards the block fence and leaked a painful voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah somehow. More importantly----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou managed to raise his body and looked towards Origami and the couple thought to be her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">---and.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lost his words when he saw them.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a giant crater instead of the couple who were there just a moment ago, and several [Parts] which used to be 2 humans were scattered about mercilessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">A normal person would probably throw up as it was such a gruesome scene. However, Shidou remained opening his eyes without moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because-----he saw it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene Origami from 5 years ago, who saw it in a closer position than Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-ah……..ah………..Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh-----------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami made a blurry voice while crawling to the object that used to be her parents as if she was depending on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next off, she grinded her teeth before looking up-----she lifted her face and glared at the source of the pillar of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">And,</p>
<p class="null-p">"An---gel…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami mumbled while looking up at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lifted his face as if he got flicked by Origami's voice----and mumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………! Do-don't tell me----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt a chill as if a bug was crawling on his body while letting out a trembling voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The person over there was,</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit Origami wearing a pure white Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't see the face of the Spirit that shot that light from there. The Origami from 5 years ago could probably just see a human silhouette. A person with no knowledge of Spirits will probably take that shadow as an [Angel].</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was you………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who was sitting on the ground, twisted those pure eyes with tremendous rage and roared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't forgive you……..! Kill…………I will kill you…..! I will---definitely………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way that her voice would reach that high in the sky but, the same time she spat out those words, Origami in the pure white Astral Dress twisted her body and trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">A stranger might see her as laughing loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no way for that Spirit to laugh-----Shidou knows that clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What………just……just what is this………."</p>
<p class="null-p">It only took a few seconds. But, all of that only need that much, before ending-----and Shidou understood everything that happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami went back 5 years to change the fact of her parents getting killed into an event that [Never Happened].</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami found out.-----The real culprit that killed her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">With her vision shared with Shidou, Kurumi's voice echoed inside his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I knew that something great must have happened to make a person like Origami turn into that………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Half-way into Kurumi's words, the Spirit floating in the sky disappeared like it was melting into the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..!? Disappeared……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"[Yud Bet12th bullet] effects most likely worn off. She probably went back to the original time"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..uh, no way! Then………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted in reflex. That was only normal. The goal of Shidou and also Kurumi, who sent him back into the world of 5 years ago, was to come back to search and also fix the cause for the inversion of Origami, who came 5 years back too.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that they were at the best seat to see the reason for her inversion. But at the same time, their goal vanished too. There was no way that history would change like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jus-just what should I-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, who was in loss, suddenly gasped and stopped his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. A part of a burning building was falling towards the Origami from 5 years back when she was sitting on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou shouted, he jumped towards Origami faster than his words and both of them rolled on the ground like that. Next off, the burning building part fell onto the place Origami was at and caused a big spark and smoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Staying here was dangerous. Shidou made a light cough while taking Origami's hand and ran onto the red road.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, they stopped once they managed to escape to a place which the flames had not touched. Matching up with that, Origami *gatan* folded her knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa…………haaa…….ar-are you alright, Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that------he noticed his own mistake. It was a sudden action but, this Origami does not know Shidou. It might be bad to call her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami wasn't concerned at all when her name was called by a complete stranger; she just kept on trembling while looking up at the sky with soulless eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">No-------soulless, might not be the fitting word to put it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anger, resentment, loss and grief--------many of every human's negative emotions mixed together and tainted those eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fa…….ther, mot-her………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami moved her dry lips and let out her disappearing voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou distorted his face in reflex when he saw that painful scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no clue on what's the best course of action he should use (take). He had no clue on what words he should say. But, he can't leave her like this. Halfconsciously, Shidou hugged Origami with both his hands. As if to suppress the waves of raging emotions, he held her tightly with his trembling hands; tightly and strongly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………, Y-ou..…are…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">And for the first time, Origami leaked out a soft voice as she noticed Shidou's existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's going to be alright! It's going to be alright, so………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While still hugging Origami, Shidou groaned as if he was crying. He was fully aware that those were irresponsible words. But, he had to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world was just too cruel and merciless for this small girl in Shidou's small arms to face.</p>
<p class="null-p">From now on, this girl will be walking a road full with hardships and she will find the [Truth] which lies at the end of her path. Shidou had to shout when he found out that cruel conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami………..you must………..you will notice this someday. All of the truth……! But----please don't forget! You are not alone…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, are you saying……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami replied back with a troubled voice. That "was only normal. But, Shidou just couldn't stop his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will take on your sadness…….! I will stop your anger……..! If you are at a loss, come to me! Use me if you face a hopeless situation! I won't mind if you throw everything at me! So, so-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">While hugging Origami tightly, he continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever you do----please don't feel despair……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami blankly heard Shidou's voice but-----after a while, her body started trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------ah-uu-ahh………….uu-yyaaaa……….aaaaaa………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami grabbed Shidou's clothes, she started crying in his chest to kill the volume.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe the thread of nervousness broke when Shidou appeared or maybe the sadness of losing her parents was pressed onto her now after so long. He couldn't determine which one was correct but-----Origami was finally showing emotions fitting for her young age.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fa-ther………Mother……..-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou poured strength into his trembling hands to pat Origami in the back while she was crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">And----after who knows how long.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………., thank you very much………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a period of crying, Origami said that with a soft voice before letting go of Shidou's shirt and stood up on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">After wiping her tears with her sleeves, she directed her bloodshot eyes to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who………are you?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Ah, e-err-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was extremely normal now that he thinks about it but, Shidou felt confused since he was suddenly asked. That answer suddenly flew out without a moment of thought for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying too hard to play it off won't do anything. Shidou made up his mind and looked back at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm……Itsuka Shidou. I live nearby here"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka……Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami pondered Shidou's name by mumbling before turning around.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if------she was trying to hide her expression from Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….was what you were saying just now true?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That you will take anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-aah…..! Yeah I am"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a big nod at Origami's words. Those words came out halfconsciously but, the contents weren't lies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Then-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami continued without continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will leave my tears with you. I will give you my smile. Please take my happiness, enjoyment, everything"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh------?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes at those unexpected words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----This will be the last time I cry. This will also be the last time I smile" After saying that, Origami looked towards Shidou for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lost his words when he saw that smile, wet with tears. Origami looked away once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, this anger is only mine. This ugly emotion is only mine.----I will kill. I will-</p>
<p class="null-p">----that Angel. No matter how long it takes. No matter what method it takes" "---------------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Angel. Shidou twitched his fingers when he heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he couldn't say it. That the Spirit was Origami from the future. He couldn't bring himself to tell this small girl that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So until then, please keep them for me. Until----I kill that angel"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that while facing her back at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ori-----gami…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou could only call her name blankly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The young avenger ran off, leaving Shidou alone there.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the night with darkness falling. Kurumi let out a gloomy sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's what happened……."</p>
<p class="null-p">There were currently 2 scenes shown to Kurumi who currently was sharing Shidou's senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she opened her eyes, she would see black beams pouring down from the Inverse Origami towards the completely destroyed buildings but, if she closes her eyes, she would see the Origami from 5 years ago run away after she vowed to have her revenge on the Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Now. Kurumi and Shidou knew everything. The reason why Origami inversed when she went back 5 years.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is ironic"</p>
<p class="null-p">She lifted her face and looked at Origami floating in the black sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The spirit was covered in a black Astral Dress that looks like mourning clothes but, she was arching her body like an embryo in a womb and was floating midair. Countless [Wing] in many sizes made a circle around her and was constantly showing its destructive will towards the ground below.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh----what are we going to do now"</p>
<p class="null-p">While stroking her chin, Kurumi mumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was good that she sent Shidou back 5 years but, the only thing achieved was they found the reason for Origami's inversion. If this keeps up-------</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Oh my?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi suddenly twitched the side of her eyebrows, she looked behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Small footsteps appeared behind Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you? What kind of business do you have with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said it as if the mysterious visitor was a bother to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a beat, the person walked out in response to her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! You're-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi widen her eyes in surprise when she saw the appearance of an unexpected person.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….., I------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, who just saw Origami went away, fell to his knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">An extraordinary feeling of powerlessness filled his lungs. Shidou couldn't do anything in the end. When that happened, the view of the ground shown in his view slowly moved away as if to respond to Shidou's actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment there, he thought that his body moved in contrary to his wills but----he was wrong. When he lowered his sights, he saw his body which was supposed to be child-like until just now, reverted back to its bigger version. Maybe his Reiryoku was depleted or maybe the time limit was up, or maybe it was because of another reason…………he doesn't know the details but, Natsumi's ability was completely released.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of an annoyed Kurumi echoed inside Shidou's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………I don't like this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Sorry. You went through all that trouble to use [Yud Bet12th bullet] for me and I still…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That isn't the problem"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kurumi continued with words mixed with a tired sigh, as a response to Shidou's apology.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Origami herself was the killer of her parents…..? I see, that reason might be enough to make her feel despair. However------that event clearly won't happen without my <Zafkiel>……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">He could hear the sound of teeth grinding. It was a rare event since Kurumi was usually so carefree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san. Let me ask you this, when was the first time you met Origamisan"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh………? Well……….my class changed at the beginning of my 2nd year and at that time-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps at that time, Origami-san already knows about Shidou-san even though it was supposed to be your first time meeting her, isn't it so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou recalled back after he was told that. It's true that, Origami knew Shidou's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou noticed at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was normal for Origami to know Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because----Origami met Shidou [5 years ago], which was [At this time].</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi sounded even unhappier at Shidou's response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is not funny. This is displeasing. It is very-----disgusting"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason on why Origami-san turned into her hated Spirit. The meeting of</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou-san and Origami-san-----the primary factors used to construct the old world was entirely related to my power. If I didn't send Origami-san and Shidou-san back 5 years, the old world wouldn't have been created………" Kurumi mumbled to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that, what she say is correct. If it wasn't for the Spirit known as Kurumi; if it wasn't for the Angel known as <Zafkiel>; their world would most probably be different in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-but, Kurumi did not use <Zafkiel>to create this ending right..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, of course. My main goal is to use [An action that would change history] and make the world's new history. I was quite desperate but in the end, I was just dancing on top of the hand of an absolute existence known as the [World].----that fact makes me very pissed"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gulped in reflex when he heard Kurumi's pissed off words.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at the same time, one thought floated in his mind before………he opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi………..is there something you want to redo?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………oh my"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Kurumi took a moment of silence before returning back to her carefree tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that's true then, won't it be interesting to redo my first meeting with Shidou-san.----Ufufu, the current me can definitely, [Eat] you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shut his mouth after he heard Kurumi's words. Though, it was not because he felt fear from Kurumi's scary comment. It was clearly because she wanted to make Shidou confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no interest in forcefully making someone say the things they don't want to. Also, now was clearly not the time to be bothering about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….., but, everything ended'</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched his fist in regret.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that Origami went back to her original world, we can't stop her from inversing. Now that the Origami from 5 years ago saw her parents get killed, her revengeful heart will not disappear. Borrowing Kurumi's words, all Shidou has done was just dance on the world's palm.</p>
<p class="null-p">He doesn't know how long [Yud Bet12th bullet] effect will stay in play but, he will probably head back to his world soon. To that nightmarish world with an Inversed Origami trampling the earth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……that's right"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi talked to reply to Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is true. Shidou-san did not stop Origami-san. You didn't change the world.---it looks like, that is the [End], [This world] has already decided"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Kurumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eye brows. He felt that Kurumi's roundabout way to say it was a little weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi probably felt Shidou's feeling of suspicion before giggling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like it has already ended------I heard that just now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heard…….from who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----The Shidou-san after 10 minutes from now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without understanding what Kurumi words meant, Shidou widen his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like what it means. 10 minutes from [Now]. The me from the [World of the Shidou-san that came back from 5 years without achieving anything], used [Yud Bet12th bullet] and send the Shidou-san from the future to the past. Well, we only talked a little since we only had 1 minute to use, maybe because I wanted to save on Reiryoku"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!? The Kurumi from the future of that world sent me…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes in shock but------thinking back carefully, it was not impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Origami came back 5 years thanks to Kurumi. As long as Kurumi is also at the future too, it was possible for her to send anyone from the future to the present time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But----at that moment. Shidou felt a question pop up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would the future me……….go through all that trouble to travel through time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That was the unnatural part now that he thinks about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Yud Bet12th bullet] should be Kurumi's secret move. It was hard to think that she would waste precious time to inform us about that hopeless future.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi replied [Yes], in his head to reply to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san, who failed to stop Origami-san, met [Yud Bet12th bullet] effect limit in despair and came back to the original world. ----but, you reached a certain idea after that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A…..idea"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. But, it's something unachievable for the Shidou-san who returned back to the present"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..! I see----"</p>
<p class="null-p">So that's why the future Shidou asked Kurumi to tell the Kurumi from 10 minutes back his thoughts --- [While Shidou was still in the world of 5 years back].</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to recreate history.</p>
<p class="null-p">To break the future that was determined.</p>
<p class="null-p">---he left his wish to his past self.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt a flame rekindling in his cooled down body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, nothing ended yet. ----Let's do this, Shidou-san. Let's break this shittyass world"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou leaked a sigh when Kurumi said a comment that doesn't sound like her before lifting the side of his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah……..I'll do anything. If everyone----can save Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, now that's the spirit"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably felt Shidou's enthusiasm. Kurumi made a pleasant laugh in Shidou's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So………what is that method?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes.-----thinking about it know, it's something very obvious. But, it's true that it's an unthinkable method to the Shidou-san who ran into a state of deep despair and anxiety"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After being told that, sweat flowed down Shidou's cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-anyway…….we're running out of time right? Let's move"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes, that's right. Time is more precious than money"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi continued after making a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The biggest reason on why Shidou-san couldn't stop Origami-san. That's because, [You did not know what was going to happen], and we are going to use this to its full advantage"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah……..that might be true"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a painful face while nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after he noticed the Origami that came over from the original world, the fight with <Phantom>started and----everything ended, without giving him a moment to breathe. There will probably be still a way if he knows these details beforehand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi sighed in a gloomy manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, I don't really want to do this but………there is no other way"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……..? Wha-what should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The theory is simple.-----you should just restart"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a dumb-witted voice at Kurumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-well that's true but……….are you going to send me back 5 years with [Yud Bet12th bullet] when I get back there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That method is not realistic. At the stage of just using [Yud Bet12th bullet] once, a significant amount of Reiryoku stored inside Shidou-san has been used.</p>
<p class="null-p">It might not be impossible but, it will be a problem to me since the portion for me to [Eat] soon might disappear"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..oh come on. Rather, did you use my sealed Reiryoku to help me travel back here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, well of course. No matter how whimsical I might get, I am not so kind as to give up my own Reiryoku to use"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said it with a tone of you got a problem? There was a lot about it he was unsatisfied with but, Shidou kept quiet for now. Kurumi then, continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, you can gain something by slightly time traveling back from the time you are at right now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..! Ah, i-I get it-----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's just as Kurumi says.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------piling up [Yud Bet12th bullet]. I see, that is one interesting idea. Well of course……Shidou-san will forcefully be sent back to this time if you don't achieve it during the effect of the 1st shot"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tsk, then, let's make it quick! Kurumi, hurry and shoot me with [Yud Bet12th bullet]!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But. Kurumi made a tired sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All I can do now is to share Shidou-san's senses. I cannot interfere with your time from here. Let alone, a bullet from <Zafkiel>won't reach"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-then, what am I supposed to do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou shouted because he could not bear it any longer, Kurumi make a small sigh as if she was blowing at his ears before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Isn't there a way. Only one method"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought his eyebrows closer at Kurumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few minutes later. Shidou used the emergency stairs of a tall building which was located near the fire disaster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa………Haa………"</p>
<p class="null-p">His body which was been made to exercise since just now, has been screaming for a long time already. The summer and blazing heat mercilessly stole his stamina away.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he can't be complaining now. There's only a little time left for him to stay at this timeline. While making loud noises, he climbed up the emergency stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this place…… Really okay….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I think it's correct, probably"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Probably, oh come on……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He opened half his eyes when he heard Kurumi's unclear words. Shidou arranged his breathing while moving his legs up to the edge of the roof to see the place which was at a dead angle from the entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could see Nankou town still burning from the building made to look down at the residence area. Sounds of the sirens from ambulance and fire trucks echoed and the evening town was really lively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">To avoid looking at that gruesome scene, Shidou averted his sights and moved his head to look at the roof again in case he missed something.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----he couldn't see anyone there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oi, no one is here. You sure this is the place….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is weird. That shouldn't------"</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">Half-way through Kurumi's words, Shidou felt a chill at his back and stood still.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….., ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">---someone was behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt that through instinct and gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to match with it, an interested voice came from the visitor that appeared behind Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---Oh my"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a familiar voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">To prevent agitating the absolute predator standing behind him, Shidou raised his hands and slowly turned behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why, look what we have here. It's rare to see a visitor at a place like this" After she said that, he saw Tokisaki Kurumi with a charming smile there.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 7: Phantom</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi from five years ago…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Several minutes before he reached the building's top. Shidou was really surprised when he heard Kurumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Yes. As I said earlier, there is only me in this world that can mess with time. Then... There is only one person that has <Zafkiel>in that timeline. The me from five years ago.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the time I can be here is limited, right? I haven't even searched for…"</p>
<p class="null-p">[You don't need to worry. Certainly, I must have been around there five years ago.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Around here…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou couldn't believe he was this lucky. He raised his eyebrows while looking surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It can't be. Did Kurumi meet with me five years ago, too? You won't say that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[No. If I remember correctly, there wasn't anything like that. Even though I was around there, it was only to observe the great fire that suddenly occurred.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"To see the fire?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[I thought that this disaster might have been caused by a Spirit.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing her word, Shido started to sweat. …If he hadn't sealed Kotori's powers back then and they were discovered by Kurumi, they might have been her food.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi sensed something from Shido's silence and slightly laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Please. Even I am not that low.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ri-right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido vaguely answered her and coughed to pull himself together. At the same time, Kurumi continued talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">[I was around there five years ago. But I haven't met with Shido-san… I can guarantee that. However- No, that's why this action has a meaning.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Please think about it. If Shido-san, who hasn't met with me, meets me, then…</p>
<p class="null-p">With only this, wouldn't be the history slightly changed?]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Certainly, it might change…"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Anyway, please hurry. As I have told before, we don't have any spare time.] "Yeah… Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, he clenched his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi, think about it. Where should I go?" Shido readied himself and asked Kurumi that.</p>
<p class="null-p">And… we return now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido stared at the figure of the girl at the top of the building, while he was trying to calm his heart that was beating like an alarm bell by taking deep breaths.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kurumi standing there was slightly different from his memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">No… In more correct way, the only thing that didn't change was her age. Her dress was somewhat different. She wore a monotone blouse and a skirt that had laces and frills. Her hair wasn't tied up but in its place she had Alice band decorated with a rose. Her most characteristic part was her face. As if to hide the clock pattern, she wore an eye patch on her left eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw that dress, Shido slightly knitted his eyebrows. Then, he asked in a low voice so that only the Kurumi in his head would hear it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Kurumi? Why are you wearing an eye patch?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Please don't worry about it.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was it hurt or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Please don't worry about it.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Please. Don't. Worry. About. It.]</p>
<p class="null-p">She said it with such a strong tone, he decided to keep quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, the five year ago's Kurumi in front of him responded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Araaraara"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that jokingly while tilting her head to the side in a cute way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you whispering? What business do you have at this place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said so in a relax tone. Though, she didn't look she was relax at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a smile on her face, but her eye was observing his moves and behavior in a peaceful but accurate way.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shido didn't have time. He readied himself and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi! I ask a favor from you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Ara?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he called her name, Kurumi bended her eyebrows curiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know my name… You, who the heck are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said so while lifting her right arm. When she did that, an ancient pistol flew to her hand from the shadow under her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then she pointed its muzzle towards him with a smooth move. Shido shook his hand in a panicked state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa-wait a moment! I mean no harm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he said that, a bullet landed on the floor right under him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't move without my permission please. I have some questions. If you don't answer honestly, I can't guarantee your safety."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems if he doesn't answer them, his heart will be stopped. He opened his mouth while raising his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, I am Itsuka Shido. I came from the world of five years later! Kurumi… You have lent your power to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, Just now, what did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Kurumi's face changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you are joking, you will end up dead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't be standing in front of you if it was a joke! Please, listen to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi narrowed her eyes as if she was measuring the truth in his words. Then, Kurumi's voice that sounded like she was amazed by the situation echoed in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Araara… The old me is quite cautious, right? …I don't want to spend any more time. Shido-san, please touch the me in front of you somehow.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Touch… Don't say absurd things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kurumi, that is pointing the muzzle towards Shido, made a puzzled face. Of course, that is natural. When looked from her point of view, he looks like he is murmuring to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido, prepared for another shot, held out his hand towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please. It is okay if the gun stays like this. Can you hold my hand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am not a naïve young girl that would do something like that when asked by a stranger, OK?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"[Kurumi] says she wants to talk to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shido said that, Kurumi raised her eyebrows in surprise. Shido sharing his senses with a Kurumi from another era was Kurumi's ability in the first place. So this Kurumi, too, should understand it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun… Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi cautiously took a step while staring at Shido and touched his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then,</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And like a weak current flowed thorugh, her body shivered a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Long time no see… I wonder if it is okay to say that, right. Me.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I understand. This is definitely my voice… right? ‐Just what happened in the world of five years ago?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow five year ago's Kurumi, too, can hear Kurumi's voice that echoes in Shido's head. Indeed, this way would be more effective than any kind of persuasion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi from the original world, briefly explained the situation. That we failed to change the history. And that, in order to try once again, we needed this era's Kurumi's power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… We need to use [The Twelfth Bullet/Yud Bet] like that, is that what you are saying, me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Yes. That's right. I wish for it, me.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Five year ago's Kurumi felt silent for a moment… Then she sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…OK, then. If it is this much, I will help you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Re, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. However, the needed power will be collected from you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi stopped touching Shido and moved behind him. Then, at the same time she made a sound with her heel, she raised her left arm high.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, now, come forth <Zafkiel>. It's your turn."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if answering her call, a giant clock's figure appeared from the shadows. Angel <Zafkiel>. The thing that send Shido to this era, the angel that can manipulate time.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, as he thought the shadows under Kurumi's feet looked like they were spreading, they started to coil around his feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, a fierce fatigue attacked him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, guh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He remembered this feeling. Right before he was being sent from his original timeline to this one, he had felt like this when he was caught by Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Zafkiel>- <Yud Bet>"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi lifted the gun in his hand above. Then, a thick shadow came out from <Zafkiel>'s [XII] letter and entered in the muzzle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now. We are starting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi slowly turned the muzzle. He knew <Yud Bet>wouldn't hurt but still his body became stiff in a reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she saw his state, she still grinned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said you were… Shido-san, right? I wish you a good luck."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Th, thank you. Also, Kurumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think that eye patch fits you."</p>
<p class="null-p">[…]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said that, the Kurumi in his head sighed and the Kurumi in front of him relaxed. {頬を緩める}</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Your praise honors me. Let's meet again, five years ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi last said that and controlled the gun that was trembling due to the fierce magical power and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">A jet black line flew out towards his chest from the muzzle.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment <Yud Bet>hit Shido, he felt as if his body moved along with the bullet.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if he was caught in the momentum of the bullet and his view went black.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">[…dou-san, Shidou-san.]</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard the voice in his head, he opened his eyes. He immediately understood that he had collapsed face-first.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was at the same roof of the same building. Well, it might be misleading to say the same. The figure of five year ago's Kurumi wasn't here and the Nankou district which can be seen from here hadn't been surrounded by fire yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was a success?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[It seems so.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi responded to Shido's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't understand the specific time but he had come back in time.</p>
<p class="null-p">To a world before the fire had started.</p>
<p class="null-p">To a world before Kotori had become a spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, to a world before Origami had killed her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">[There is no time to be lost in thoughts, Shido-san.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being told that, Shido stood up and took a look at the view of the Nankou district that spread out under his eyes. He clenched his fist and whispered as if he was talking to Kurumi. "…Let's go 'n change the world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi was silent for a second, then affirmed by saying "yes." After hearing her affirmation, Shido started to go down the building by the emergency stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, we have successfully returned to time before the fire occurred but… What should we do now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[We arrived to a good position with great troubles but it has suddenly become a mess, huh?]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi answered him with a teasing voice as if she was surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh… Th, there is nothing I can do! I mean, why have you been cold for a while?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[There is no such thing.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said so in a pouting manner. Shido wondered if he had said something rude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi, is it about the eye-patch?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi raised her voice to stop Shido's talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">[It was only an impolite act of rebellion and only that. The difference between the me now and the me you just saw is, that I know what is going happen afterwards. Let's organize the situation based on that.] "Ye, yeah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">[First, what do we really need to do?]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi asked in the manner of a teacher. Shido started to think of an answer while running down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is… To prevent Origami from killing her parents."</p>
<p class="null-p">[Yes, that's right. Then, what can you do in order to accomplish that?]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like… Stopping Origami somehow."</p>
<p class="null-p">[Certainly that is the easiest thing to do but, I don't think that is quite realistic.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh… Th, that's right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who had believed that <Phantom>was her parent's enemy, is a devil that will definitely take revenge. As Shido raised his voice, he noticed that only that there had to be more to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition, the power of the girls that turn into spirits is the strongest without a question. Practically, Shido needed to chase the girl that will fight with <Phantom>in a dazzling air battle with all his might.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, the possibility wasn't zero. If Origami paid attention to Shido and listened to him, there was nothing he couldn't think of.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the time limit of the <Yud Bet>, which Kurumi had fired at the beginning, wasn't that much. This might be the last time he could rewind time. It was dangerous to bet all to such optimistic thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then… If I take her parents to a safe place… or something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">[I see, there might be a possibility of doing that and not facing Origami at all.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ri, right? Then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">[But, I wonder if they will obediently do so, if an unknown teenager comes to their house and says that it is dangerous to stay there and tells them to run away.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"If, if I explain the situation..."</p>
<p class="null-p">[I am sure they will believe you if you tell them that you came from the future and that they will be killed by their daughter that also comes from the future, right?]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He started to sweat when he realized how suspicious he would look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just now the Kurumi from five years ago, had believed in his words but that because manipulating time was originally her ability and… The sound of the Kurumi in his head had quite a lot to do with it. In the first place, if he had explained the situation to Origami's parents whom had never heard about spirits, the fire would probably break out halfway through.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Also… Even if you managed to get Origami's parents to safe place, it couldn't be guaranteed that everything would work out for real.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Wh-what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[What if the world retracts to the original timeline no matter what, then…There might be a possibility that Origami's ray of light would be released before they could evacuate.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido was shocked by those words. Certainly, it was as Kurumi said. At the moment Shido had returned back to this time line by the help of the Kurumi from five year ago, the world had subtly changed into one that they didn't know about. It was dangerous to think to assume that everything will go on as they know it would.</p>
<p class="null-p">…However, something didn't make sense. He asked Kurumi while squinting his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi. You said that it wasn't possible to alter time, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Ara, I don't remember such denial. I don't have any proofs, so I just assumed." "…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt somehow confused but this wasn't the time to pursue such problems. He shook his head to pull himself together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, what do you say we should do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Right…]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi was quite for a while as she was thinking, then she continued her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">[How about making Origami-san realize that she was the culprit after the killing of her own parents?]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Wh-what are you saying?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido shouted when he heard Kurumi's proposal,</p>
<p class="null-p">[Ara, you think it is against the common sense but. Wasn't what reversed Origami-san the despair she had when she had realized that the thing she thought was a foe was her own self?]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-that's right, but wouldn't the fact that she had killed her own parents stay the same then!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido started to shake tremendously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly if they used her method, they might evade her reversal. However, then the fact that she killed her own parents with her own hands would stay unchanged.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moreover, the fact that her parents had died in the hands of a spirit will remain the same. In addition to that, her desire for vengeance was pointed towards someone else at the point. Towards Kotori who caused the great fire and possibly towards <Phantom>who gave her power…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As he thought that, he let out a small voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">[? What happened? You stopped running.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said so in his head. Shido realized that he had stopped running unconsciously.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, before moving again, he told the idea that occurred to him in a breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kurumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">[What is it?]</p>
<p class="null-p">"The point is; if Origami's <Enemy>isn't there the moment she appears... Won't it be good?"</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">Five minutes after that. Shido was hiding in the bushes while looking at the swings.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a single girl, who had her hair split to two, sitting on the swings. She might be 7 or 8 years old. She had melancholic expression and was boringly swinging while the swing squeaked.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no doubt about it. Five year ago's Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked at her weary expression and had a feeling as if his chest tightened. Surely this day was Kotori's birthday. Shido had gone to the next town to surprise her with a present, but… He didn't think that she would be this lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw the lonely Kotori, his chest hurt and he heard a chuckle in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Shido-san, you are a complete pervert, right?]</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was annoyed by her words and moaned as a reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well certainly, he would be in trouble if he was seen in this scene in which him, a male high school student who is hidden, staring at a female elementary school student.</p>
<p class="null-p">There would be flyers, which states that there was a suspicious person roaming around, being distributed around the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the young Kotori's moment of shining hadn't been printed in his retinas yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido was… waiting.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the arrival of <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Even so… You have surprisingly made up your mind, Shido-san.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said so in an interested tone. Shido hesitated for a second before answering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is nothing I can do. Also, didn't you support this idea?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Well, that is right but. Certainly, if you can drive away <Phantom>before</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami-san appears, there won't any reason for her to attack in the first place.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I can do it… I want to talk."</p>
<p class="null-p">[Talk? With <Phantom>?]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi asked in a slightly surprised way.</p>
<p class="null-p">[That is unexpected. I had thought Shido-san hold a hostility towards <Phantom>.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Very much. I can't deny that. They are the one that turned Kotori and the others to Spirits… But, before that I don't know anything about <Phantom>. I can't ignore such thing, if I do I would be the same as the guys that regard Tohka and Yoshino and the others only as disasters.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said those, Kurumi stayed silent as if she was thinking something, then…</p>
<p class="null-p">[Fu-fufu, ahahaha…]</p>
<p class="null-p">She laughed at a time like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[It is nothing… I only thought this is Shido-san for you.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi continued after laughing a little more.</p>
<p class="null-p">[However, I don't recommend doing so. There is no point in talking if it is with that person. If it is the charming Shido-san, it would end up you being confused.] "Eh…? Kurumi, you, about <Phantom>…" Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stopped talking before finishing his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. In his view… In front of Kotori who is playing in the park alone, there was a strange visitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Age, gender or physique unknown, [Something].</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that was natural. As if its appearance was masked, [that] was covered with something like a noise.</p>
<p class="null-p">…<Phantom>. The being that turned Kotori, Miku and Origami into Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">That had appeared in front of Kotori, now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido looked at that figure and got goose bumps. Kotori who had become Spirit <Efreet>. He recalled her painful expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Shido-san, you can't act rashly.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, yeah, I got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido was restrained by Kurumi and sighed slightly to keep calm. He embraced his arms to stop his trembling. He pressed his nails to his palms and slightly blood oozed from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">He shouldn't stop Kotori's turning into a Spirit. He was told so by Kurumi just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">-After Kotori and <Phantom>exchanged several words, <Phantom>turned towards her and took out something like a red jewel.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, the moment Kotori touched it, her body stared shine faintly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ah, aaaaaaah…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori yelled in anguish.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, a terrifying heat wave with her in the middle spread around and a swirling flame rose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido lowered himself and, mind-blowingly, he somehow reflected the heat wave.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few seconds later, he faint-heartedly opened his eyes and saw Kotori's figure dressed in a spirit clothing that looks like a kimono.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's how… Kotori had become Fire Spirit <Efreet>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori… I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">He muttered bitterly and narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then he resolved himself and dashed in front of the cluster of noise that had stood in front of Kotori, <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He screamed that.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, <Phantom>made a voice that didn't resemble neither man nor woman. At that time the silhouette that is covered with mosaics in front him, looked like it moved a little. It seems like <Phantom>had moved their neck and turned their view towards Shido.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time Shido took a thin breath and glared at the part of <Phantom>that seemed like the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, I wanted to meet you… <Phantom>."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he quietly called the name of the noise in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any sarcasm in those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he re-sealed Kotori's powers, he had remembered his memories from five years ago and since then, somewhere in his head he had been wishing for a reunion with this unidentified existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Turning humans into Spirits.] An arrogant monster that had the power to make such an unreasonable phenomenon that defies nature.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the culprit of the changes of Kotori, Miku and Origami into Spirits and of the destruction and confusion that came with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards the [Thing] that had changed Shido's life, he felt deep connection like it was his fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the words <Phantom>said towards such Shido were unexpected. […Huh?]</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>let out a small breath and turned her body slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, <Phantom>'s body was covered with noise. From his point of view, he could only see a distortion in the air covered with mosaics.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, why might it be? For Shido, he didn't have any choice but to believe that, that behavior was caused by dismay or disturbance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, anybody would react like that if they were suddenly called by somebody behind them. But… that was wrong. <Phantom>'s reaction was clearly not because she was surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">[It can't be. You were… Why are you…]</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido made a puzzled face when he heard <Phantom>'s odd reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You… Do you know, about me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[…]</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>stayed silent when it heard his question. However that was, it wasn't that it had ignored his question or didn't want to give any unnecessary information or something like that… It was only that it was so dumbfounded that it couldn't say anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">It couldn't understand the meaning of what was happening and knitted its eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a gap between the aloof <Phantom>in his memories and the behavior of [Something] in front of his eyes. That's why, he even thought that the noise that was in his sight might have been a different existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">[…,…]</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>slightly moved its body covered in noise and run away while sliding on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Shido-san.]</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if pulled by Kurumi's voice, Shido followed after <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Kotori who had sat down in the park had entered in his sight. The little girl that held a power which she didn't know about said "Brother, brother…" repeatedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, Kuh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt like his heart was being pulled by that look but he strengthened his resolve and turned forward. If his memory was correct, five year ago's Shido should arrive soon. He shouldn't come across him.</p>
<p class="null-p">And above everything… Now, he had to stop <Phantom>from running away. Shido was following the cluster of noise of which he had nearly lost sight as he wasn't prepared with eyes and put more power in his legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">He succeeded in getting <Phantom>far away the park but just this wasn't enough. Shido and Kurumi's aim was to make <Phantom>and Origami who had come to this timeline not meet. In order to accomplish that, they needed to put <Phantom>to a place where Origami wouldn't find her… That's why, they had to not let her get Lost.</p>
<p class="null-p">[…But, that was an unexpected reaction, right?]</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was following <Phatom>, Kurumi's voice echoed in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Shido-san, are you acquainted with that person?]</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Not even a little, I don't know anybody that has their whole body covered in mosaics!" [Fuun… That's right.]</p>
<p class="null-p">He shouted while running in the town that is burning brightly and Kurumi answered in a somewhat tepid way.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't like Shido was telling lies. He had only encountered with <Phantom>at that time five years ago. Well… Certainly it was that [Five years ago] right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it clearly seemed like <Phantom>knew about him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, it was a fact that it had met with Shido or somebody that looked like Shido.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's it. DEM Industries' Managing Director, Isaac Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shido had infiltrated in the Japan HQ of DEM to rescue the kidnapped Tohka, that man whom he had seen for the first time had laughed in a really strange way.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he was leaving, he had called Shido:</p>
<p class="null-p">Takamiya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't because of the intense exercise he had been doing but he felt his heart beat faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">Takamiya. That was the same name with his self-proclaimed real sister Takamiya Mana's.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also… Shido who was the adopted child of the Itsuka family didn't have any memory of the time before that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am asking you, <Phantom>, what do you know about me?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While following <Phantom>that continued to run away in the burning town, he shouted so.</p>
<p class="null-p">When though about it, there were a lot of things Shido didn't know about.</p>
<p class="null-p">What he was doing before being taken in by the Itsuka family.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why Westcott knew about him.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place, what that power he had was… What the hell was that power of being able to seal Sprits' powers?</p>
<p class="null-p">He had sealed seven Spirits' powers and had sent them into a life they lived together but he didn't understand anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He grinded his teeth in frustration and stepped on the ground strongly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then… At that moment, <Phantom>that was moving in front of him, stopped moving for no apparent reason. Shido, too, suddenly stopped his body that was moving with great momentum.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, <Phantom>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">[…]</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shido called <Phantom>'s name, it moved its body that was covered with noise slowly. Somehow it felt like it looked at his way. [… <Phantom>, huh. So you gave such name to me.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, it murmured that like talking to itself and sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">[…I'm sorry. I suddenly run away… I thought it would have been better if we weren't in front of her.]</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>continued talking. The [She] it is talking should be Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't understand its aim but certainly it was better this way for him, too. If they had stayed at that place, five year ago's Shido would arrive soon and… Origami who had turned into Spirit would also come. […]</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>stood still without saying anything. It seemed like it was taking a good luck at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">[…Ah, is that it? So it was really, you are…]</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, it made a gesture as if it was convinced by him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, at the same time, the noise covering <Phantom>'s body dissolved like fog. "Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">What appeared from inside that noise was a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had braided hair and an expression that was gentle like that of a mother. He felt as if his head started to spin around. That face made him feel like he had seen it before and like he had never seen it before… It made a strange feeling. "That appearance…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't see [Me] yet, that's why excuse my impoliteness of using another shape… I could finally talk to you after all those troubles however, unfortunately I need to use this barrier." When Shido talked, <Phantom>answered with a voice that definitely belonged to a girl which was different from the one she had used till now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Another shape. Which means, this girl wasn't <Phantom>. But, why would <Phantom>do such an indirect thing…</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido thought about it for a second. <Phantom>kindly smiled as if she had read through his mind and moved her cherry colored lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You, [When] did you come from? Looking from your appearance, it would be something like five or six years later, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard that, he made a startled face. That was it. He didn't thought that <Phantom>could tell that he came from another timeline just by looking at his appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">[…]</p>
<p class="null-p">However, contrary to his surprise, Kurumi kept her composure. As if, she had guessed this beforehand.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>continued with a quiet tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Then… What business do you have? You have come this timeline using that bullet. You didn't come only for sightseeing, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Shido turned back and glanced at the park <Phantom>had been in just now. In the air above it, the figure of a shiny Spirit hadn't appeared yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">After he confirmed that, he opened his mouth slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You… You know about me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yes, I know. A lot that is."</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>answered him. He felt that he was trembling because of tension.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Think about it. Who the hell… am I? What the hell is this power?" "…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard his question, she stayed silent for several seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she replied after swinging her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I would like to answer that but, I don't know what kind of situation you are in. Also, I can't tell it. In addition, there seems to be a kid that is eavesdropping our talk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido made his eyes round and <Phantom>continued as if she saw through everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right… Tokisaki Kurumi. I wonder if you are listening to me." [Ara, ara.]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi made a quiet noise in his head as if she was replying <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is this your business? If that's it, you have used fairly extravagant amount of [Time]."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, no."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido casted down his eyes and swung his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing I am doing now is only my problem. I have another business with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What may it be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Disappear, right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a huge amount of things he wanted to ask. He had finally found somebody that knew his past. He wanted to know. Honestly said, regardless of what should be done, he wanted to learn about himself from this [Thing].</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this was the thing he had to say right now. His priority was to stop Origami's reversal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that [I will kill you.] in a poetical way?"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>sighed wearily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… I can't say I didn't expect it to come to this. As a few year later's you are loved by moody Spirits, there was a possibility that you could reach this idea. …Well, I didn't want to think about it, though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems like <Phantom>thinks Shido came from his timeline in order to kill her. Shido clenched his fist without saying anything. It would be a lie if he had said that he held no hostility towards her. He can't let off the fact that she had caused pain to young Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, now Shido didn't have any intention of doing anything with her. After taking a deep breath to calm his mind, he swung his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is not about killing or not killing. I just want you to hide as soon as possible. You can go to the next world, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fuun?"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>continued her words as if she had intense fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it okay if I learn? The reason for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido hesitated to answer that.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. He didn't know anything about the expectation or aim of the girl in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami would… From the future five years later, Origami who had been turned into a Spirit by <Phantom>would come here and attack <Phantom>. It was easy to say that. Then as a result, she would reverse. It was easy to tell that their aim was to prevent this.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if this <Phantom>'s aim was to reverse Spirits like Isaac Westcott from DEM, giving her this information would cause the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know how to answer her. While he was trying to come up with an answers, <Phantom>sighed impatiently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Well, it doesn't matter if you can't answer. I am sorry but my answer is NO. I have some jobs I haven't done yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he heard <Phantom>'s answer, he lost his temper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a minute! After this, to this timeline…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido opened his mouth to tell her about Origami. However… That moment, he couldn't move his body as if it was pushed by an invisible hand. Intuitively, it was close to the feeling of being bound by the Territory that AST and DEM's Wizards deploy. He could hardly move his fingertips and couldn't make any voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Shido-san, what happened?]</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi suspiciously asked but he couldn't answer that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, <Phantom>came closer to him slowly After that, she raised one hand and touched his cheek</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">An indescribable sense passed through Shido's whole body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't understand why. But, then he understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido knew that feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido, knew this [Something] in the form of a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to thank Spirit of Time for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">While <Phantom>was touching Shido's cheek with her hand, she said so quietly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When the time comes, let's meet again. That time…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She continued her words in his ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Because I absolutely won't let you again. Because I absolutely won't make a mistake."</p>
<p class="null-p">And said those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido held his breath instinctively.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't understand something. He wouldn't understand sooner or later. However, he definitely remembers that he had heard those words before. "…, …"</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to ask who she was but he couldn't let any sound out.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>drew her hand back from his cheek and wore her noise again. Then, she kicked the ground and flew towards the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few seconds after that, <Phantom>'s figure was so far that he couldn't reach her even if he jumped and the power restraining him was finally released.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, haa… Cough, cough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He fell down to his kness and coughed several times. However, it is not the time to do such things. Shido immediately turned his head upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That one… What, the heck…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, just as he lifted his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stared at <Phatom>floating in the air and a line of light came from the east sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! That is…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His shoulders shook and looked at where the line of light was launched from and he was frozen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who stood there was a single girl. A dazzlingly pure white Spirit dress. Several [Feathers] turned towards the nemesis by the personification of murderous intent. Spirit of Ruin, stood there.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no need to even say. …It was Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He screamed her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was no way his voice would reach her. Origami looked straight to only <Phantom>and several lines of light were released like rain from the tip of her feather shaped Angel. While <Phantom>unbelievably dodged all of them nimbly, she moved in the sky like she slid through it. However, Origami didn't give up. She followed after the fleeing <Phantom>and launched lines of light in the air without resting.</p>
<p class="null-p">What spread out there was, a few minutes ago… It was the second time, he had seen this view. He had seen it with five year ago's Kurumi before she had sent him back. Kurumi's earlier said words passed through his mind. "What if the world retracts to the original timeline no matter what, then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He swung his head to shake off the thought of resignation that floated in his mind for a moment and dashed to follow those two from the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't let it… repeat!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene he had witnessed recently crossed his mind. The downpour of light. The remains of people that had been crushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the pupils of the little girl whose eyes were dyed with hatred and the revenge.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami only wished to protect her parents. She had only tried to deny her fate that had been already decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were such pure feeling but experiencing such tragedy couldn't be good.</p>
<p class="null-p">This ending…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will change it…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido put more power in his feet while yelling that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally he couldn't follow Origami and <Phantom>who are having a tremendously high speed air fight by running on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">However… His aim was not to track those two. He continued to run in the town that was covered with flames without hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before long he had arrived to the place he had been aiming.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the place Origami's both parents had died in [The World Before],</p>
<p class="null-p">That was it. What he had to stop wasn't Origami and <Phantom>'s fight but Origami's killing of her own parents by accident.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! Found it…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido opened his eyes wide while running in the blazing red.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of him stood the back of the figures of five year ago's Origami and… her parents whom stood a little away from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no need to grumble about it again. He had failed to prevent Origami and <Phantom>'s contact. So, he had no other option than making her parents run to a safe place to change the history.</p>
<p class="null-p">It should be called fortune among misfortune and now was an emergency as the town was enveloped in the big fire. A man who hurriedly encouraged evacuation wouldn't be an alien thing. The possibility that they would run away following his directions was enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">However…</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He opened his eyes and strengthened himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was really simple. At some point in the sky above… Right above Origami's parents, Spirit-Origami and <Phantom>'s figures stood. It seems they have come here while they had been engaged in a fight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time Shido bitterly grinded his teeth, Origami launched a lot of lines of light towards <Phantom>to block its ways of escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then at the same time, the feather type Angel concentrated one and pointed its tip below… Towards the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the exact scene with [Just now]. Shido's face paled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't do that, Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His voice didn't reach her even if he yelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't have the chance of prompting her parents to evacuate anymore. The next moment, the critical hit would come down and would send two people to the heaven before they could even feel the pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it…!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido put more power in his foot and kicked the ground with the momentum.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Shido-san!?]</p>
<p class="null-p">As his did such an unexpected move, Kurumi's surprised voice echoed in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was nothing else he could think to get away from the situation he had fallen into.</p>
<p class="null-p">A great pillar had been launched aimed at the ground from the Angel that had concentrated its power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo…!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Shido yelled with all his power and leaped towards Origami's parents…</p>
<p class="null-p">And pressed their back with all his strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When suddenly pushed like that, Origami's father and mother both yelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were pushed by his all might. They might have scraped something like their knee.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that much would be forgiven, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if, they might have hit their head badly. Shido, while his sight was dyed white, distorted his lips in self-mockery.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while he was like that, someone's voice vibrated his eardrums.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought it was Kurumi but he was wrong. This voice clearly came from outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, right before his sight was filled with light, noticed it. It was five year ago's Origami in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyes met with hers for a second.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those eyes didn't glow with the blaze of revenge yet. The pool of resentment weren't being piled up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… That's good."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido muttered slightly. Then, he was enveloped in pure white light and he lost his consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 8: <Devil></p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After making a soft moan, Shidou opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems Shidou was lying face down on a bed. His left cheek was pushed into the pillow and the pillow was obstructing him from opening his eyes. It seems that his body stayed in that position for too long, because he couldn't feel his left arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuaaaa……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shido leaked one sleep yawn before turning around on the bed and raised his body after he faced upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time he was released from his own weight, his left hand which he couldn't felt, slowly *Jiin**jiin* turned numb. Shidou [Ouch ouch ouch………] frowned his face before looking around at the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing was different. It was his usual room. It was his usual furniture's, wall, floor and ceiling. In a rare occasion, Shidou hung his school blazer on the chair, maybe because he was too tired yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Ah-re?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Something was off, Shidou blinked his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The memories of how he went to bed yesterday were completely out from his mind. Rather, what month, what day and what day of the week is today? Before he slept, he was------</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fragmented information inside his head started to connect one after another. Inside Shidou's mind, he recalled back the scene before he fell unconscious.</p>
<p class="null-p">A burning city. A beam poured down.------Shidou immediately looked down at his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">From what he saw------there were no wounds or body parts missing. Shidou was completely healthy even though he took the strongest and absolute attack from an Angel. It might be thanks to Kotori's healing powers, or maybe------the moment the light was about to burn Shidou, [Yud Bed]'s time limit was reached and his body was forcefully sent back to his time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, no matter which one it may be, it still doesn't change the fact that he was saved. Shidou made a big sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">But immediately, the next question floated into his mind. Shidou quickly got off his bed, pushed aside the room's curtain and fully opened the room's window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where is…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked outside while mumbling softly. The view he saw was the familiar Tenguu city residential area. When he looked to the right, he could see the tall mansion where the Spirits live in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Kurumi! Kurumi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou placed his hands on the side of his head, and raised his voice to communicate with the inside of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kurumi's voice could not be heard no matter how long it took.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, that was reasonable. The [Tet] Kurumi talked about was a bullet to connect her conscious to a target that was in a different timeline. Which means, the bullet would probably not show its effect when the target exists in the same timeline as the Kurumi who shot the bullet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Shidou came back.</p>
<p class="null-p">He returned back to his world from the Tenguu city of 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou leaked a mumble.-----more specifically it was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">The view shown to Shidou was the scenery that he was familiar and used to.</p>
<p class="null-p">The buildings, houses, roads were all the way it was supposed to be. Basically------it was not the scene of the Tenguu city that got completely messed by the inversed Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..uh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time he realized that, Shidou left the room with the window wide open and went down the stairs with a momentum that could make him fall. He then ran to the living room and opened the door with a loud bang.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, Kotori probably got surprised. A small girl---Kotori, who was sitting in the living room sofa while looking at the television, opened her acornlike eyes even wider towards Shidou's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohh? What's wrong onii-chan? You're so energetic this early in the morning"</p>
<p class="null-p">She's an active girl with 2 white ribbons tying her long hair. It seems she woke up earlier that Shidou and has already finished changing her clothes to her school uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou however shouted when he heard his sister's leisure voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori……! You're safe!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou shouted while breathing wildly, Kotori tilted his head as if she does not know what he was talking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Onii-chan, are you half-asleep?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she said that, he twitched his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, Shidou's actions can't be helped. In the [Old world], <Fraxinus>was shot down by Origami, and he had no way to confirm Kotori and the crews safety since they were in the ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Kotori, what is today's month and date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? It's obviously 8th of November"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said that with worried eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kotori's response was the best information to Shidou. If Shidou's memories were correct, that date------was the next day after the inversed Origami destroyed the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----aah----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou walked over to Kotori with a face close to crying before [Hashii] hugging Kotori with both his hands. Kotori's eyes turned black and white at his sudden actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyaaa---!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori……Kotori…….! I am so glad……I'm really----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyaaaa! Gyaaaa!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori flapped her hands and legs. Shidou was kicked in his stomach and he crouched down.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, this pain was so nostalgic. The sense of fulfillment and relief wouldn't stop over-pouring.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………What's wrong? You're kind of weird, Onii-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori hugged her shoulders with red cheeks while saying that. Well, to her who has been seeing a different changed world since 5 years ago, Shidou's actions probably looks eccentric.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Hey Kotori. Would you believe me if I said I changed the world yesterday?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori widen her eyes and frowned her eyebrows after a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying Onii-chan. The return of your delusions?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then placed her finger around her chin while saying that. She's not believing Shidou's words…………..rather, she looks like she has no clue what he was talking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">But------That's okay. After Shidou made wry smile, he swung his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn…….Sorry, I was dreaming a bit I guess.-----I'll make breakfast in a flash so wait for me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-ohh---……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori nodded while making a dubious face. After Shidou made a small shrug with his shoulders, he headed to the washroom to wash his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">He has to report to Kotori about the change of the world someday. That's because, it was a big event where, just like the meaning, he rewritten the world. Thinking about the future, there was no way he shouldn't tell the <Ratatoskr>about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, just how is Shidou going to explain this experience which only sounds like a dream-like story? Shidou scratched his cheeks while *uuuh* making a groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">After having breakfast with Kotori and leaving the house after he dressed up, a familiar girl was already in front of the gate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooh, you're here huh Shidou! Good morning!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a beauty with night-color hair and crystal eyes but, she was swinging her hands energetically to him.-----Yatogami Tohka. Shidou's classmate and also his neighbor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ou Tohka. Good morning. Sorry, did I make you wait?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I just came out from home. Its perfect timing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said it with a full smile on her face. Shidou laughed in reflex when he saw that innocent look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…..more importantly, here"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Shidou handed over the lunch box he was holding to her. Making Tohka's portion together with his and Kotori's bento has become a daily routine to him. He was going to buy lunch today since he woke up late today but…………..he quickly prepared everything so that it would be as close as the [Normal] days, which has been a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oooh………! Thanks, Shidou! If I am correct, there is that bite-sized katsu inside right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou tilted his head at Tohka's next words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu………? Am I wrong? I thought you said that when we separated yesterday…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka placed his hand on his chin while bringing his eyebrows closer to recall back her memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this world, Shidou saved Origami's parents 5 years ago and Origami did not inversed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, Tenguu city wasn't destroyed and as a result, they were going through normal days [Yesterday].</p>
<p class="null-p">But for Shidou, who was back at 5 years just a few hours ago, does not have the memories of this world all the way to [Yesteday].</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging by Tohka and Kotori, it seems that there wasn't a big change to the world but, there should be small events like this unknown to Shidou like this one…………it might be a good idea to confirm this with everyone as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……….Sorry, Tohka. I am kind of out of ingredients. I made another menu"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu, is that so. But, you don't have to apologize you know? Every food Shidou makes is delicious! So, what's inside?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, minced meat, scrambled eggs, peas and 3 colored rice. The eggs is the sweet kind"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-wow……..! That's the best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's cheeks blushed and said that in an excited manner. It seems she's satisfied with this menu too.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Tohka was dancing around while carrying the lunch box, he saw two shadows walked over from the mansion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka, good morning. Good work picking me up, my attendant"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bow. Good morning, Shidou, Tohka"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai Kaguya and Yamai Yuzuru, twins with similar faces. Both of them look so similar that they can't be distinguish in one glance but, after taking a good look, their faces are slightly different and also, a tragic difference of body shape which could only be thought to be god's prank, could be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………um? Shidou, did you just thought of something really rude?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The slim girl with a proud face----Kaguya opened half her eyes with a posture as if she was hugging her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no way. I didn't think of anything"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really………? It's a sin to lie to me you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Warning. You are over thinking, Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, the glamourous girl with her hair tied into 3-----Yuzuru, placed her hands on Kaguya's shoulder before saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, it was only for an instant but, I saw Shidou's eyes took a trip around our chest"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explain. That is normal reflex for a male"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Oi"</p>
<p class="null-p">That isn't helping. Sweat droop down Shidou's cheeks while he opened half his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So he just reacted to my charming body huh. Kaka, then I forgive you. There is nothing as harsh as resisting the Yamai's charm"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. That is correct. No matter how much Kaguya has indecent delusions of Shidou every day, it's not like everyone would think like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I don't have those delusions!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya shouted with a red face. When she did that, Yuzuru looked interested at Kaguya's response and placed her hand on her mouth to [Small smile. Ufufu].</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regret. Is that true. Then, the diary Kaguya wrote yesterday night was----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait…………! Kyaa! Kyaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya suddenly became noisy and *Poka**Poka* hit Yuzuru's shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Escape. Kyaa"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying it in an un-nervous voice, Yuzuru ran away from the spot. Kaguya then immediately followed after and they started running around Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Haha"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou leaked a small giggle in reflex when he saw them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe they saw Shidou's reaction, Kaguya and Yuzuru made a wondering face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what is it Shidou. Why are you making such a farsighted look…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. Did you grow old in one night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With Shidou in between them, both of them had their eyebrows closer to each other while saying that. Shidou swung his head to play it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nothing at all.----More importantly, we will be late if we keep this up"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Kaguya and Yuzuru looked at each other before making a sigh while making shrugs with their shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun……….the maliciousness is over. In consideration for Shidou, I will let you off. But there is no next time. Know that people who tries to reveal my darkness, will be touched by the hands of the death god"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sneer. My darkness (Laugh). Is the darkness those objects hidden under Kaguya's bed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…….why do you know thaaaaaaaatttttttt!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dash. I am going first"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuzuru said that, she waved to Shidou and Kaguya before running to the school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waiiiiiitttttt! Eh, no seriously, why!? Why do you knowwwww!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya chased after her while shouting. Even though their Reiryoku were sealed, both of them immediately could not be seen anymore; just as expected from the Spirit of the wind huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Let's go too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu? Umu, okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou shrugged his shoulders and said that, Tohka blinked her eyes before nodding to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then walked beside him and they walked towards the school------they then reached the high school.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou passed the gates, he switched his shoes into indoor shoes and reached in front of the 2nd year group 4 after he passed the corridor and climbed the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou's body stopped when he placed his hands on the classroom door.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. He was hesitant on how he should talk to the girl sitting at the left side beside Shidou----Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">The person receiving the biggest influence from 5 years back was definitely Origami. Unlike the small discord of memories that he have with Tohka, there might be a bigger change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, you're not going in?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaah……..Sorry sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he was told by Tohka, Shidou poured strength into the hand holding the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">And while feeling a mix of weird feeling of anxiety and uplift, he opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..What"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened the door, and viewed the classroom before making a wry smile while sighing.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was still no one sitting on the left side of Shidou's seat. It seems that, she has not come to school.</p>
<p class="null-p">It somehow felt embarrassing for worrying about that. After Shidou scratched his cheeks, he sat on his own seat and took out the textbook and notes from his bag which are going to be used for 1st period.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami hasn't come to school even though he waited for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka suddenly made a difficult face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn, what's wrong, Tohka"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu………for some reason, I feel something is missing…………..it feels kind of weird"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Something missing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou wrung his neck when he heard Tohka's words. But, faster than replying back to Tohka, the school chime rang nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">The classroom door opened immediately right after and a small girl wearing glasses entered the room while carrying the attendance book. It was Shidou's class homeroom teacher, Tama-chan; Teacher Okamine Tamae.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's cheeks relaxed in reflex when he saw her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, the Tama-chan he encountered when he returned to the world at 5 years ago, had the completely same appearance as now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-kun? Is there something on my face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….! Ah, No, Sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">He replied back in panic when Tama-chan asked in a dubious manner. Tama-chan coughed before she started to take the attendance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's surname is [Itsuka] so; his attendance check will be fast. After Shidou quickly replied, he looked over to the vacant seat on the left.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Origami did not appear even though the home room started. Is she absent today. Or maybe, Origami was late for a rare occasion.</p>
<p class="null-p">During the time Shidou was thinking that, Tama-chan was continuously calling out the student name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, Tonomachi-kun is present…………then, Nakahara-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----------Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a dumb-witted voice in reflex when he heard the name Tama-chan called out.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was only normal. Since the attendance numbers is mixed gendered, it was weird that [Tobiichi Origami] wasn't after [Tonomachi Hiroto]. Even if she was absent for today, her name should be called.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that his voice was louder than what he thought. Tama-chan looked surprised and looked towards Shidou's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-re, did Sensei make any mistake"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-err…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stood up with a thud.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou was hesitant to say the words.</p>
<p class="null-p">A thought grazed his mind for a moment there.-----That, in the previous world, Origami [Transferred to another school].</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he won't know anything if he keeps quiet. Shidou made up his mind and shook his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensei, what about……Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Babump**Babump* his heart pumped hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami [Transferred to another school] because she was recruited to DEM industries in the previous world. That should not be applicable to Origami now that she holds no hatred to the Spirits. Even though he knows that, the worst possible word that Tama-chan might say was swirling inside Shidou's head.-------That, [Origami-san already transferred to another school]……….</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----Tama-chan's answer was different from Shidou's expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Origami………san? Who is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan said that with a surprised expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes blankly while looking around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he suddenly stood up and said that, Shidou was currently the attention of the class but…………..everyone was showing weird responses at the name Shidou said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Origami? Who is that. A person's name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did Itsuka-kun fave 1000 paper cranes to Sensei as a present?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that would mean that Sensei is in the hospital. Rather, there's no way to make 1000 paper cranes alone"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but it's that Itsuka-kun so"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone started talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked at his classmates while feeling his breathing turn wilder.</p>
<p class="null-p">They don't look like they were joking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone does not know. The girl known as Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..Aah---------That's right----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou *Suuu* breathed finely. Strength left his body and both his hands drooped down.</p>
<p class="null-p">---now that he thinks about it, this event was not unthinkable. The possibility was enough. However, somewhere inside Shidou might have made him avoid this.</p>
<p class="null-p">If the young Origami and her parents escaped the fire, it was normal for them to look for another house to move to. They might still be living in Nankou town or they moved to another place just like the Itsuka family. If that's the case then, there was no guarantee that she would enroll into his Raizen high school just like the previous world.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago, Shidou definitely changed history. He succeeded to erase a tragedy that occurred once, before it happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">But all of history did not change according to what Shidou wanted.</p>
<p class="null-p">All the events existing in the world was connected with invisible lines.</p>
<p class="null-p">The event Shidou achieved became the starting point and it was inevitable for an event outside his goal to happen in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..sorry, Sensei. It was my misunderstanding. Please continue"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that quietly, he collapsed onto his chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan looked worried for a while when she saw Shidou like that but, she soon started to continue taking down attendance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">While dazing off, Shidou listened to Tama-chan and quietly looked at the left seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">---There is no problem at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago, he saved Origami's parents who were supposed to be dead, and Origami won't bear any hatred to the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami should be living happily somewhere in this world. It's such a happy end that wanting more is going to bring bad luck.</p>
<p class="null-p">To Origami, the previous world was unnatural to her. She was someone who should be living in a gentle world. She should receive more love from her parents and grow up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It's okay with this.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world----should be like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And. He suddenly heard Tohka's voice from his right seat. Her tone was sounded dubious but it also sounds like she was worried about Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn…….What is it, Tohka"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err…………what's wrong? Where does it hurt………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being told that, Shidou noticed something for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">---There were tears flowing down his cheeks and falling onto the desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">He quickly wiped his tears with his uniform sleeves, before replying back [I'm alright] to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka distorted her eyebrows into a 八shape but, even though she looked fidgety, she did not say anything afterwards; she might have felt that there was no need to pry into it any further since Shidou told her that he was okay.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">---should I be crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou mumbled to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe he felt happy knowing that Origami was living happily. Or maybe------he felt lonely that he could no longer see Origami again. Shidou was not very sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes…..only one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou thought of one thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who could not live her life as a normal girl because her heart was captured by revenge last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who placed herself into battles like it was normal and thrown away her tears and smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">He ------wanted to see her smile normally even if it's just only for one time.</p>

<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Evening. Kotori with her hair tied with black ribbons, was sitting in a reverse position on the house living room's sofa while staring at something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Further up her sights, she saw her brother's back----Shidou preparing dinner in the kitchen. The blue apron looks great on him, so much that it's displeasing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, it's not like that scene was that rare. But, she felt that Shidou has been acting strange since today morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">He ran down energetically down the stairs during the morning, he tried confirming the date, he then hugged Kotori and after saying something that only sound like he has not taken up yet, he suddenly changed completely now and came back from school with a really depressed expression. Just what could happen to make his tension fall this far all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..Fuun"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori snorted, she moved around the rod of the chupa chups in her mouth while turning her body posture back to normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt disgusting.</p>
<p class="null-p">---she was unhappy that an event that caused Shidou's heart to shake this much happened at a place where Kotori did not know.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori crossed her legs unhappily, Yoshino, who was looking at Shidou like her, let out a worried voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened……..to Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">She has fluffy hair and sapphire blue eyes. It was a girl with a height close to Kotori's. She was currently wearing a light colored one piece.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Neee. He doesn't look energetic"</p>
<p class="null-p">Matching up with Yoshino's words, the rabbit puppet worn in her left hand[Yoshinon] flapped its mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">And as if to reply to that, another girl sitting beside Yoshino----Natsumi was making a bored face (She actually wasn't that bored) by placing her hands under her chin while letting out her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………That listless look.----it's a woman"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha------!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and Yoshino widen their eyes when they heard Natsumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa-wait, what do you mean by that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A……..woman?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Natsumi immediately lost her confidence when Kotori and Yoshino asked her why.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Ah, no, I might be wrong so, don't worry about it……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't go weak on me now. Hurry up and say it"</p>
<p class="null-p">She grabbed Natsumi's head with both her hands and faced it towards her. When she did that, Natsumi's eyes looked away in uneasiness while she nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………. If it comes to a worried high school male, the reason for it is most likely a woman"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means, Shidou got dumped by someone……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't go that far but………a boy at that age will basically be conscious on how his action vectors are, towards a girl…………..maybe there is a strange rumor about him spread around the girls, or he might be treated coldly by the girl beside him; simple things like this will make boys depressed"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I wonder if that's correct………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yoshino made a meek face and said that, Natsumi made a big nod before continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There is more; she would reply [Eeeh…..] in a serious tone when you say let's team up! Or, when you picked up the eraser she dropped, she would</p>
<p class="null-p">[Ah…….i don't need that anymore, you can have it…..] or things like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Na-Natsumi-san……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right when the club's encouragement was heated up, and you took your application form to her, she would tell you [Ah, but our morning training is seriously tough so are you alright with it? No seriously, you don't have to force yourself you know?] Or when we are having dodgeball during gym time and a girl ran away while shouting [Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!] in a serious tone when I was about to throw the ball; Ahh god damn it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"C-calm down!</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, the last half turned into Natsumi's hateful complaints…………somehow, she's a Spirit with quite a detailed knowledge of school life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..A-anyway. Something definitely happened in school………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi said that while her breathing was a little rough. Kotori also agrees with her on that opinion. She looked at Shidou, who looks somewhat lonely with the side of her eyes while making a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But well, I think its okay to leave him alone since it's not that serious………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it's tough to see…………Shidou-san not energetic. Can we do something about it………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yoshino said that, Kotori scratched her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, even I want to do something about it but, asking me how is just………." After Kotori sighed, Natsumi made a bitter face while saying this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….If a girl is the one giving a high school boy sorrow then, only a woman can heal it right"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori twitched her shoulders when she heard Natsumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A woman………..yes, that's………Ah-re?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaa! Natsumi-san you pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino and [Yoshinon] probably realized that meaning too. Yoshino's face turned red while [Yoshinon] covered its face with both its hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori brought her eyebrows closer, she *Ton**ton* hit the temple of her head with her fingers while making the candy rod stand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait just a second. Why must I do something like that for Shidou-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I…..will do it. If Shidou-san will get energetic with that then I will……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori replied with a screechy voice, when she heard Yoshino's unexpected words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn……….I understand. Then leave it to me. One shot from Yoshino, and</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou will get lively. Okay, let's start…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa-wait for just a moment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori spread out her hand to interrupt Natsumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….W-what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she got surprised from her sudden voice, Natsumi froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't say I won't do it, I didn't say no……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I- I see…….then, Kotori too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Fuun, I have no choice huh. ----so, what are you planning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kotori folded her arms and asked, Natsumi raised one finger and said her proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….because the imagination just now, it looks like I can use a bit of my Reiryoku"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori widen her eyes and let out a dumb-witted voice. However, she immediately realized the meaning of those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Since Natsumi's mental is exceptionally low compared to the other Spirits, her mental condition will collapse easily even if it's something this simple, and that would cause her Reiryoku to counter-flow.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-----Natsumi's power was a transformation power that allows her to change her targets appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-wait a sec. Don't tell me you're going to make us into children and make the [A zoo belonging only to me] again. That's no good. If Shidou enter guardian father mode then, it will cause more burden to him instead"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori warned her. Yes. Last time, the girls were turned to children because of Natsumi, and they were made to wear animal ears with a leotard too.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Natsumi swung her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This time……..it's going to be opposite"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The……….opposite?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and Yoshino looked at each other in wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………., that was close"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, who was preparing dinner, suddenly twitched his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he was cutting a cabbage while thinking, he was close to cutting his fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…….this is no good, I have to be careful"</p>
<p class="null-p">He exhaled and lightly swings his head. Unexpectedly, it seems Origami was filling his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he can't stay like this forever. If he restarts cooking without focusing, the girls might end up eating vegetables mixed with Shidou's blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">He calmed down by taking a deep breath and held the kitchen knife again.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Shi-shidou. I'll help out"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's slightly trembling voice could be heard from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn? Aah, thank you. Then, over there-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou turned around while saying that and-------froze. His hands were trembling from his loss of composure and that caused the knife to fall and stab into the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was unavoidable. Kotori and Yoshino------Both of them weren't in their familiar child appearances but have grown to girls who are about the same age as Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them grown taller, and were covered with a special beauty to girls who placed their hands on the door to adulthood. Unlike Yoshino, whose breast grown accordingly too, Kotori's breast did not change much.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was not all. It was their outfits.</p>
<p class="null-p">He don't know the reason but, both of them were wearing an apron with frills over a swimsuit and a head dress on their head, making them look like summer maids which was out of season. What's more, it seems that they are embarrassed because, they were contracting their shoulders with red cheeks in an uncomfortable manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what are you two wearing, both of you!? Forget that, your body-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that in a flustered tone, both of them looked at each other before cuddling into Shidou's arms with awkward movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-why not"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That…….is right. More importantly, please let us……….help too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He-help out………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweat flowed down when Shidou heard their words. Since they were joining Shidou's arms, he might accidently feel their breast if he made any movements. Especially, Yoshino's were dangerous. It seems that there is some room for him, in Kotori's side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Shidou? Are you thinking of something rude?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori sensed something and glared at him. Shidou quickly swung his head. Now that he thinks about it, Kaguya said the same thing in the morning. For a moment there, he was about to leak out a question about "Does girls with small breast have sharp senses?" but, Shidou will become today's Ikedukuri[11B 1] for dinner if he asked so, he gave up on the thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">This situation was as if he was dreaming. But………….Shidou had an idea for this development.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's obvious. That's because Shidou has experienced looking after this power just a few days ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi! This is your work huh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou saw the top of her head twitch while it was poking out from the shadows of the sofa, when he shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while of silence, Natsumi gave up and slowly revealed her face. As expected the Spirit-Natsumi, who has the power of transformation was over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like Kotori and Yoshino, Natsumi grew up to a high school girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">But……….she was wearing a normal maid outfit and was not like them, who were in stimulating outfits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------wait over there damn it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shouted when she saw Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi! Why aren't you in a swimsuit! We already agreed that all of us will go like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi looked away awkwardly at Kotori's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, well you see………….thinking carefully, it's kind of embarrassing and so uncool and somewhat idiotic………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you let us wear something this idiotic!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ko-Kotori-chan…….calm down…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Yoshino calmed her down, Kotori still looked pissed. She rolled up her invisible sleeves and jumped towards Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why you little; I'll make you like us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-uwahh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi raised a screechy shout and quickly ran away from the shadows of the sofa. However, Kotori did not give up too. both of them then started running around the living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait right there! I'll tear off those clothes…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Iyaaaaaaaaah! I.am. going. To. Get. Raped!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who the hell is going to do that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shouted to Natsumi, who said that with teary eyes. Dust puffed up nearby them because they were running around vigorously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-oi, both of you calm down!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's, not good …….. To fight…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was trying to stop them, he took of his apron and walked to the living room. Yoshino with a troubled face followed him from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that didn't go well. Since they were playing tag in the living room with many obstacles, Natsumi's leg got caught under the carpet and fell towards their direction. Of course, Kotori who was chasing behind her also had to stop suddenly. She dived to Natsumi's back with all her might.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa-wawa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaa……………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai------"</p>
<p class="null-p">All their voices mixed together and afterwards; they caused a grand crash with the sofa and table dragged into the process. Incomparable to the amount of dust when Kotori and Natsumi were playing tag, huge amounts of dust puffed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch………are you all alright-----!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his body while saying that with a groan but-------his voice screeched.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, his face was thrust into Natsumi's skirt when they fell. Natsumi's butt which was separated with one thin cloth expanded in his view, causing him to gasp.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyaa--------------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-uwaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time they shouted, Natsumi stood up as if she felt a backlash from something. Shidou's face got squashed for a moment there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what are you doing Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-are you okay, Shidou-san…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, who replied to their voices, stopped his words again. It probably got caught onto something when they fell; Kotori's bottom swimsuit was slide down-----as for Yoshino; her bra part got unraveled, causing her voluptuous bust to peek out from the side of the apron (Yoshinon performed a fine save though).</p>
<p class="null-p">They realized that a moment later. They dropped their sights onto their body and their face blushed red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them shouted at the same time and crouched down to hide their breast and buttocks.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Natsumi was pushed over when she stood up and once again fell onto Shidou's face with her butt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ukyaaaaaaaaaa!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">3 shouts and 1 voiceless shout echoed throughout the Itsuka living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa…………that sucked……."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few minutes. Shidou cool his nose with a wet towel while making a big sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, Yoshino, and Natsumi already reverted back to normal. From what Shidou could see, they were dropping their shoulders apologetically.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun……….I'm sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am sorry…..Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">Starting from the right side; they started apologizing. Shidou made another sigh before making a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. Don't worry about it.------it's my fault to make you all concerned about me. You wanted to cheer me up right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, 3 of them nodded while they were still apologetic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at them like that, Shidou scratched his head. It seems, he was so down that the girls could easily find out. Even though he was told not to break the Spirits mental state in a daily basis, this was the completely opposite of what he should be doing. After Shidou placed the towel on the table he *pan**pan* slapped his face to take focus.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------Thanks, you girls. I am focused now. I am okay now"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou saw their cheeks relaxed a bit when he said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori immediately opened her eyes before folding her hand to act tough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu-fuun……..That's good. I won't pry on what happened to you but, the Spirits will feel uneasy if you keep that up"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt that Kotori acting tough was kind of cute so he made a wry smile while shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it seems Kotori does not like to be taken light of by Shidou. She made her mouth look like a へ shape and continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It'll be a problem if you keep losing focus like that. We won't know when a Spirit will appear. Of course for unknown spirits, there is still Kurumi and also even <Devil>----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows in reflex when he heard the codename Kotori said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He-hey wait a second there, Kotori. <Devil>……..? Who is that Spirit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked back at Kotori and replied back.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Devil>. At the very least, it was a name Shidou did not hear before.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kotori brought her eyebrows closer in doubt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying Shidou. It's that Spirit hunter <Devil>you know? Alongside <Nightmare>-Tokisaki Kurumi, she's the target we have to be the most cautious to. Don't tell me you forgot"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alongside…..with Kurumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweat flowed down Shidou's forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">This world has a slightly different kind of flow compared to the world Shidou knew. He was forced to know that today. If that's the case, there is a possibility that a Spirit Shidou does not know has appeared already.</p>
<p class="null-p">However-----it was hard to believe that a Spirit worth being cautious alongside that worst Spirit-Kurumi would appear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori folded her hands with deeper doubt when she saw Shidou's reactions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you…..seriously saying that? What is wrong with you today? It's as if your memories until yesterday completely disappeared"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……aah, sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">He slightly lowered his head when Kotori's words were close to the mark. Kotori then made a sigh before making the rod of the Chupa chups in her mouth stand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..so, you really don't remember?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah………can you explain to me if possible. Er-----about that <Devil>"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Kotori sighed once more before nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Devil>. We confirmed her manifestation but, we have no success in contact; she's an unidentified Spirit. And-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori left one moment gap before continuing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------This is just my speculations but, she might be an inverse-type" "Wha………..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An Inverse type……..? What do you mean? Are you saying that an inversed Spirit appears normally?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said, I don't know the details"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said it irritated. This information must be something the Shidou of this world has to know.</p>
<p class="null-p">The question of----why an inversed Spirit appeared did not stop popping out but, there were mountain worth of things he does not know. He regained his composure and continued his questions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….what was that [Spirit hunter] you said just now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just like what I meant.------<Devil>does not appear alone. She will only appear when other Spirits manifested as well……………..and attack that spirit. For Natsumi, it would have been dangerous if the girls didn't went there to save her"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori said that, she looked towards Natsumi. Maybe she recalled back the events that happened then, Natsumi's shoulders were slightly trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-wait. Attack Spirits? That's…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It's just like the AST and DEM.------at first, we suspected her for being a part of their organization. That………..Just maybe, they tamed a Spirit to attack other Spirits. But from what we can see, <Devil>is not associated or aiding the neither DEM nor AST. Actually, both the AST and DEM also attacked <Devil>"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why………..would <Devil>attack the Spirits………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows. There might be a reason but we won't know until we ask her. She would immediately blink somewhere so <Ratatoskr>has not come in contact with her, not even once"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shrugs her shoulders exaggeratedly. Sweat flow down Shidou's cheeks while he placed his hands on his chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit that hunts other Spirits, <Devil>. A weird odd feeling appeared inside Shidou's heart when he heard that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey………….can I see an image or a video of that <Devil>………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We do have it but…………..i think it's meaningless to see it okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, Kotori [Uuun] scratched her head while moving the candy's rod up and down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well……………a picture is worth a thousand words. Wait over there"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori left the living room, after she said that. She then immediately brought a B5 size terminal tab from her own room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's this. Take a look"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori placed the tab on the table and played the video.</p>
<p class="null-p">A completely destroyed city was shown. There were smokes and explosions nearby and he could tell that it was in the battlefield.</p>
<p class="null-p">--inside there.</p>
<p class="null-p">[That] was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a human silhouette covered with darkness. I see, it's no wonder that Kotori said [it's meaningless]. Not only was it difficult to distinguish the human shape, her face was covered in darkness and could not be seen. But, the part where several wings were floating around that human provided enough convincement to give the name <Devil>to that silhouette.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he saw that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou leaked a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not because he saw the Spirit's strange appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">---it was because he knows this Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that he can't see her face and expressions.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou knew. He saw this Spirit before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…..way………."</p>
<p class="null-p">*Kata**kata* his teeth clattered. His whole body trembled with short intervals in between.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, that's-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Ori-gami……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That was Origami, who turned into a Spirit and inversed.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day. After Shidou reached school with Tohka like yesterday, he leaked a loud yawn, when he reached his own seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, who was sitting at his right side, opened her eyes in wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu, are you sleepy, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah………I didn't sleep enough yesterday"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu, that's no good. Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha………well, I guess I'll take a nap before dinner after school"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou made a wry smile, he simply wiped of the tear oozing out from his eyes and made a small sigh before absent-mindedly gazing at his left seat. The seat that Origami used, in the previous world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">---The reason for his lack of sleep was obvious. The reason was divided into two big roads last night.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the first one; he went outside. Shidou slipped out of his house alone after dinner and head towards a certain place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It was the mansion Origami used to live at the previous world, and the Tenguu Nankou town residential area where the fire disaster occurred 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was one reason why he did that. He thought Origami might be there.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, reality wasn't that sweet.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no one living in that mansion's room and the house that the Tobiichi family used to live had another signboard placed in front. He asked the people living in the house about the Tobiichi family just in case but, they don't know their exact location.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked at the empty seat while mumbling to one.</p>
<p class="null-p">The video Kotori showed yesterday. The unidentified Spirit- <Devil>shown inside was definitely, Tobiichi Origami. What's more, she was not a normal Spirit-----but an inverse-type.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Creak* he clenched his teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">---he doesn't get it.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the world 5 years ago, Shidou should have succeeded in changing history. Origami should be living as a normal girl in a normal world.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so…………….just what happened to make Origami turn into a Spirit. And why was she inversed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore, judging by what Kotori said, Origami attacked other spirits. If that's the case then it's no different than the time she was with the AST.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, <Devil>will disappear too when the Spirit got Lost. Thanks to that, the city won't suffer that many damages.</p>
<p class="null-p">His head hurt because there were many things he don't know. Just what happened in this 5 years and this world. Shidou scratched his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it…………why is that the only………."</p>
<p class="null-p">He recalled back another action he took yesterday while saying that in irritation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other action Shidou took. That was to collect as much information of this world as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">---The moment he found out about Origami in this world, endless amount of uneasiness and questions filled his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought that just maybe; events different from the one in Shidou's memories might have occurred in this world and he does not know about it. Or maybe-------events that should happen never happened at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou returned home and talked to the girls (Kotori looked quite suspicious though), and managed to peek into the <Fraxinus>database even though it's brief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Conclusion; he found out that the flow of history in this world almost matches with Shidou's memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori turned into a Spirit 5 years again, and found <Ratatoskr>.</p>
<p class="null-p">On 10th of April, Shidou met Tohka and sealed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Yoshino's sealing, Kurumi's and Mana's encounter, the Yamai sister's sealing, the battle with DEM and the sealing event for Miku and Natsumi. Everything matches exactly to what Shidou knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes------beautifully leaving out, his relations with Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was thinking about that, the chime signifying the start of class time rang and the door opened with his homeroom teacher Tama-chan entering the room. We stood up when we were told to, bowed down before sitting back down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, good morning everyone. Let's work hard for today as well"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan said that with a smile. But, Shidou didn't hear most of her words. He looked out the window blankly while resting his chin on his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">---As expected, he had to see Origami one more time. After thing for one whole evening, that was the answer Shidou reached.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he found out yesterday that everyone didn't know Origami, and when he found out that the Shidou of this world has not even met Origami before, he thought that he would no longer be associated with Origami anymore. Actually------he felt that this might be the best choice for Origami. There was just no way that, meddling with Origami's life when she is living a happy life was a good thing to do. Shidou felt that it was enough if Origami was living somewhere in this world in peace.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, now that he saw that video, he could not say that any longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ravages of war clinging around Origami weren't over yet. Shidou's mission wasn't over. This disgusting world was still burdening her with a cruel fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, Shidou was too unknowledgeable of this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even if he made his resolve, there were several walls blocking him from his goals.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place, the Origami of this world does not know about Shidou. Before even that, he does not know where Origami is.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………like I thought, I can't do anything alone"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou mumbled that with an inaudible volume, he *Ton**Ton* tapped the table with his fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, he needs <Ratatoskr>'s help on how he should move. Once he gets back home, he has to explain the situation to Kotori and look for Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">………believing something like changing history by slipping through time was doubtable but, they won't flat out refuse since this was related to the Spirit<Devil>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">While looking outside through the window, Shidou gripped his fist to strengthen his resolve.</p>
<p class="null-p">And----at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, oh yes. Today, I will introduce friend to all of you. ------okay, come in"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Tama-chan said that as if she recalled back the matter, *Gara* the classroom door opened and a girl entered. It's a transfer student.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt that it was rare that a transfer student would come in at this time but, it wasn't the time for him to be concerned about that. Shidou did not look away and took a glance towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">But------</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes in shock when he saw the girl walking to the teacher's desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a slim girl with a graceful face like a doll. The color covering her back was a little pale and it made her look like a princess from another country.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the girl appeared, he noticed his classmates turned noisy. The males leaned forward with an [Oooooh!?] while the girls had sparkles in their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou was the only one astonished within them and stared at the girl's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. He was familiar with that girl's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, please introduce yourself"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan asked the transfer student.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl then nodded before facing forward and talked with a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----I am Tobiichi Origami. Everyone, glad to meet you all"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then took a deep bow. Everyone in class turned noisy.</p>
<p class="null-p">A part of the students probably recalled back Shidou saying the rare name [Origami] yesterday. Some were tilting their head wondering why; maybe they read too much into it vulgarly, they looked towards Shidou with a prankster's smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou didn't have the leisure to respond to that now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">He widen his eyes and a trembling voice leaked out from his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although her hair length was different, it was definitely Miss Tobiichi Origami inside Shidou's memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou couldn't let out his voice from the shock, Tama-chan moved her sights to look around the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeeerr, as for Tobiichi-san's seat……….The seat beside Itsuka-kun is empty I see. Can you sit over there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami agreed and slowly walked towards Shidou's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami suddenly stopped after taking a few steps.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was immediately known. Their eyes met since Shidou was staring at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Shidou leaked a short voice out from his throat, Origami widen her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes met with a boy who was staring at her. There was no way she wouldn't be surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was strange. Origami's reactions looked a little different from the said reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----No way. You're…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. She said it as if she was familiar with Shidou's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, after Origami immediately swung her head to regain her composure, she then changed completely by bowing down formally before settling down on the seat designated by Tama-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked at Origami series of actions while feeling his heart pumping faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">---What was that just now? Origami knows Shidou?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was impossible, thinking logically. However, then just now-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay! Let's start with the attendance!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan started calling the students name with a cheerful voice but, none of it entered Shidou's ears.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 9: Instinct</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Haaah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's suspicious voice could be heard over the other side of the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, it was something natural. Shidou would probably give the same reaction if she suddenly calls him during break time to report about [That information].</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Shidou slipped out of the classroom after the homeroom ended and called Kotori after he reached an empty spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori was giving agreeable responses when she first picked up the phone but, the rustling sound of her changing her ribbon could be heard half-way through and she said those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori followed her words with perplexed words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait for a moment there. What is going on? Please explain in details"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Just like what I said. <Devil>, transferred into my class"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou bitterly said that words he told Kotori just now, once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I say, I don't get your meaning. Why would <Devil>transfer into your school………no, in the first place, <Devil>is an unidentified Spirit. We have not confirmed her neither her name nor face before. Just how did you know that the person that transferred in is <Devil>?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's………."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a good question. Shidou hesitated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have no time now so I'll explain the details when we get back home. But……..i am serious. Believe me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Kotori kept silent for a while before *Haa* making a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………I get it. I'll send an observation unit over just in case. Anything more, will depend on the results we get"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….! You believe me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was something he said but, it was a little unexpected. When Shidou let out a surprised voice, Kotori replied back with a tired manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Honestly, it's a 50 50. -----but, there's no way I won't do anything if I was told that <Devil>'s identity is known when we are clueless about her"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think Shidou would say something without any proof anyway. No………..even if it's a gut feeling, you have done enough for me to believe those words"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, if you are thinking of making <Ratatoskr>investigate and get information's about a girl you like; you won't get away easily"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I won't do that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou shouted, Kotori [Unn] groaned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, we will start investigating now. Err, what is that female student's name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami. It's Tobiichi Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tobiichi Origami. Tobiichi------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori stopped her words at that moment. Her throat sounded softly as if she recalled something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that…….perhaps it's, AST's Tobiichi Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes when he heard Kotori's words. AST. It is the abbreviation of the Anti-Spirit team, even within the JGDSF.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that Origami was affiliated with that organization. But, this should be something in the previous world. There's no way for Kotori to know that-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou twitched his shoulders when he thought that far.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori, don't tell me you have memories of the previous world……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah? What are you saying? You're still dragging yesterday's dream again?" However, Kotori replied back with a calm tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I am correct, there is a member with that name in the AST. She fought with the girls many times before. But, she resigned just a while ago"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's word's got stuck. It's not like Kotori regained her memories of the previous world. But even so, Origami was still affiliated with the AST.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reality those 2 facts shown. It was something really simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Origami is in the AST in this world too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just why………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by why……….you mean the reason why she quit the AST? How would I know that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori probably misunderstood Shidou's mumble as a question; Kotori *fuun* snorted while saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But now that you mentioned it, the time when Tobiichi Origami resigned AST and the time <Devil>started appearing, matches. Fumu, If the reason why she turned into a Spirit was because she resigned then…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori groaned while started mumbling something.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, half of those words passed through Shidou's ears.----inside Shidou's head, the fact that Origami entered the AST was swirling inside his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why Origami entered the AST in the previous world in the first place, was to kill the Spirit that killed her parents. In this world where her parents were saved, just what kind of event pushed Origami to do such a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Hey Shidou, are you listening?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..! Y-yeah……….sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou got surprised when Kotori called him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mouu, get a grip. Anyway, we will be investigating if whether or not Tobiichi Origami is a Spirit. Shidou, you report to us too if you find anything.----but, if Tobiichi Origami really is that <Devil>then she is a really dangerous Inversetype. Please don't be reckless"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah……sorry about that"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, he offed his phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He leaned against the wall after stuffing his phone into his pocket. The much information got too complicated inside his mind, and he couldn't arrange all of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, nothing will happen like this. After Shidou took a deep breath, he then returned back to the 2nd year class 4.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he entered the classroom, he found a crowd of people at the window side. It seems everyone was interested at the cute transfer student. Origami was making a troubled face in the center of his classmates.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at right at that moment, the chime signifying the start of class time rang and everyone went back to their seats while waving back. He saw Origami *Haa* exhaled, after she waved back to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………haha"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's cheeks turned softer by reflex when he saw that unfamiliar scene. If it was the Origami he knew then, she won't change her expression at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">But……..this was something he doesn't get.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why would Origami enter the AST in this world? Why did she become a Spirit? Why-----did she inversed. And also, how is she able to return to her human form and maintain her consciousness even though she inversed. It's just plain mysterious no matter how much he thinks.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, the teacher entered the classroom when Shidou was thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Class is about to start. Sit down"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…….sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou quickly returned to his seat, he took out his textbook and notes onto the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, naturally, he can't focus in class. Shido's sights were directed towards Origami's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Like I thought, I have to talk to her at least once. Shidou does not know anything about the Origami of this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, people would probably crowd around her like just now, if it becomes break time. Judging by this rate, it is going to be hard for Shidou to talk to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou immersed himself in thoughts for a while, he wrote words at the edge of his note.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then tore it out and folded it before placing it onto Origami's table without the teacher noticing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who noticed that, tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking at the words written inside the piece of paper, Origami widen her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that day's break time. After Shidou sneaked out of the classroom, he headed towards the stairs leading to the roof.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was far away from the classroom block, there aren't many students that would come here. Actually, the stairs was so quiet that it made the hustle and bustle echoing in the school a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that does not signify the fact that no one was here.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was already one girl standing there.------it was the transfer student, who is the topic of the day; Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even within the students that passed their 3 years here in the school; only a very small number of them knows of the existence of this isolated area. It's weird to think that a transfer student would be at such a place.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou was not surprised. That's because,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, this"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami took out a torn piece of paper from her pocket and showed Shidou. It's true that it was Shidou's handwriting and the words were mainly to tell her to come here at break time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Shidou called Origami out here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, Sorry. Calling you out all of a sudden"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uun. That is okay……..so, what do want?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami asked with a slightly stern expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it was probably normal. She was called out to this remote place by a male student she first met. It's not weird for her to feel danger. Rather, Shidou should be grateful to her for listening to his request and come here alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">However for some reason………………….it's quite a new experience that instead of Shidou being cautious of Origami, Origami was the one that was cautious of Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah---………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his cheeks while wondering what he should talk about. There were mountain worth of things he wanted to ask but, suddenly pressuring her with them will bring out the possibility of strengthening her cautiousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami made a surprised face. Shidou didn't get the meaning at first but, he immediately realized the reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-sorry. Tobiichi……….san. Sorry for calling your name"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-un, I was just a little surprised. Err……….Itsuka-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said Shidou's name. Shidou made a wry smile when he heard that unfamiliar call.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nothing. More importantly, Tobiichi-san. You said something when you saw my face during the morning right? What was that all about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Origami made an expression as if she recalled back something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to rub you in the wrong way. Itsuka-kun looked exactly like a person I met a long time ago so, I got surprised"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's-----me…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uun, there is no way. That's because, I met that person 5 years ago. Itsuka-kun is still in elementary school. Also----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----That person already passed away. 5 years ago, in front of me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou realized something when he heard those words. The identity of the person Origami was talking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">That person is definitely Shidou. It's true that when Shidou saved the parents of the Origami from 5 years ago; his eyes met with Origami even though it was just for an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that all you wanted to talk? I want to go back to class………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………! Ah, wait a sec"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickly stopped Origami, who was going down the stairs. Shidou has not gained any of the information he wanted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, he could not see any advancement if he acts as a student that knows nothing. He made up his mind and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps, the person you met 5 years ago-----was during the fire disaster in the Nankou town?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh------?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami widens her eyes when she heard Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How, do you know…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when she was about to finish, Origami made a surprised face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps---that person was Itsuka-kun's older brother………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out an idiotic voice when he heard Origami's unexpected words. It seems, she thinks that Shidou is the brother of the person she met 5 years ago. But it was probably normal for her to do that. She won't believe him if Shidou told her that it was him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He does not want to have her misunderstand this but…………….if he is able to advance the conversation smoothly then it had to be done. Shidou judged that and tilted his head forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well……….around there I guess"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Origami suddenly changed her expression. Her eyebrows distorted and her face looked as if she was going to cry soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To-Tobiichi……..san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami walked to Shidou and after taking his hands, she took a deep bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your brother saved my father and mother. If not for that person, they would have died on the spot. It might not be enough no matter how much words of thanks I five you but, let me say this. Thank you----Thank you very much…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-aah……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou got taken back at Origami's reaction and replied back vaguely.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, her words were able to give Shidou one important information. As expected, Shidou successfully saved Origami's parents 5 years ago. Shidou exhaled in relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami noticed something and immediately let go of Shidou's hands before she lowered her head one more time with her cheeks blushing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I am really sorry; that was all of a sudden"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No……..it's okay"</p>
<p class="null-p">He made a wry smile when he felt a weird strong emotion from the reaction that does not look like it belongs to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the same time he confirmed one reality, the other problems turned even more mysterious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err……………..Tobiichi-san. Tobiichi-san's parents were saved right?" "Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami nodded. Shidou exhaled before continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, are you living together with them now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….No. My parents died in a car accident 4 years ago"</p>
<p class="null-p">"------!? Eh……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised a high-pitched voice in reflex when he heard those words Origami said while she was looking downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no way…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The correcting force of history; such a word grazed his mind. Kurumi did not deny nor agree this but-----in the end, the powerless feeling of unable to change the death end of Origami's parents no matter what he does, attacked Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-kun………….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami frowned her eyebrows in suspicion in response to Shidou's shock. That's normal. It was only natural for her to feel something was off if a boy she first met today showed such a reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she swung her head to calm herself down before lowering her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am sorry……………….even though, Itsuka-kun's brother saved them"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, there is no such thing"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami lifted her face and continued on with a dignified manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the 1 year after Itsuka-kun's brother saved my father and mother, I received many things from them. That was something that I won't get if not for Itsukakun's brother; it is something precious to me. I am----really thankful"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could not see any falsehood coming from Origami's face when she said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I- I see……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said that while slightly looking away. It was really sad that Origami's parents died and he felt sorry for her but……………..the words he heard from Origami just now helped him quite a bit from the thought that what he did was all useless.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami said that her parents died from a car accident. If that is real then-------</p>
<p class="null-p">After making his resolve, Shidou lifted his face, stared at Origami's eyes and opened his mouth after he gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then-----why did Tobiichi-san entered the AST?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gasped when she heard Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That was Shidou's question. Origami's parents escaped the Angel's attack on that day on the fire disaster. If that happened then, Origami shouldn't be harboring any hatred towards the Spirit…………?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you know of the AST------"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami was about to finish, she recalled back something and raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps, Itsuka-kun has gone outside when the space quake alarm was initiated?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…………? Ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a short reply when he heard and saw Origami's words and suspicious expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Origami affiliated with the AST in this world too means that there was the possibility that Shidou was seen running to the spot to talk to the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-aah……..actually"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Like I thought. I wasn't mistaken after all"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This topic was raised several times in the team. That, there was a citizen still around the danger zone. -------I felt that the person looked similar to [That Person at that time] but, I thought that it would be Itsuka-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Origami's sights turned stern.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is really dangerous. Please avoid that from now on"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-eerr…………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied back vaguely when he was pressed for an answer. Even though he was told that; as long as there is a mission from <Ratatoskr>, he has to continue standing in front of the Spirits from now on too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how did she take that reaction? Origami exhaled.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was prepared if she wanted to pursuit for more but, Origami did not pry further into his situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead, she made a strong-willed expression and looked back at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You asked………why I joined the AST"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, can you tell me if it's okay with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami tilted her head forward when Shidou said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-kun, if you know the AST then, you should also know the cause for the Space quake right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Spirit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. A special biological disaster, Spirit. -----And, you might have already investigated this but, the one that killed your brother at that fire 5 years ago, was a Spirit"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's throat rang as if he was speaking ambiguously. Shidou was alive and well like this but, he probably looks someone that got erased to Origami at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami clenched her fist harder and continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person sacrificed himself to save my father and mother. The reason for my current self, is thanks to him.-----that's why, I thought this. I don't want any more people to end up like him. That………..i will become someone that would protect the people from the Spirits"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">A meaningless voice leaked out from his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like the scattered puzzle pieces were concentrating into one frame.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the previous world, Origami made up her mind to defeat the Spirits because of the anger caused by the Spirit killing her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou went back to the world of 5 years ago to avoid that and successfully saved Origami's parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the secondary [Shidou's death] that happened when [Her parents death] was avoided, became the new live coals to Origami's new determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">How----ironic. Shidou felt his heart turning noisy at the wicked prank of fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Itsuka-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami tilted her head maybe because she felt suspicious since Shidou was silent. Shidou's fingers twitched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, no, nothing……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course he was not okay. But, he could only answer that now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou succeeded in changing the world. But in the end, Origami has witness something. She witnessed a Spirit----killed a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the meaning of that does not only show despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The events that happened in the previous world and this world were different.</p>
<p class="null-p">The results were the same at first glance but, instead of her parents that she was with for several years getting killed in the previous world; in this world, the only person Origami saw die was a young man who she has no clue what his name was.</p>
<p class="null-p">More importantly, that young man was now living normally like this. If he could explain that fact properly to her then, she might-----</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou bit his lips at that moment. There was one big problem he forgotten.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Not only did the Origami of this world turn into a Spirit, she also inversed too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was not very clear on how to make the [Inverse] appear. But, he was very certain that the Spirits have to fall into deep despair for it to occur.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked at Origami once more. It's true that her atmosphere and talking pattern was different from the Origami he was familiar with. However, the girl right in front of him right now does not look like she feels despair to this world at the very least.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori warned him not to be reckless. However------he had to ask her this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I ask……..one more question?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami tilted her small head. Shidou made up his mind and asked her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----why did Tobiichi-san…….turn into a Spirit"</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami widens her eyes in wonder at Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, turn into a Spirit……? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Shidou who widen his eyes this time from that unexpected reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought she was playing a fool but…….he was wrong. Origami really does not know what Shidou was talking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean……? If I am correct, that's………."</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Shidou mumbled softly while thinking about something, the bell signifying class was about to start soon, echoed in the school. It seems lunch break was over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like lunch break is over. I will be going back first.------Thank you very much, Itsuka-kun. I am very happy to have talked to you"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then went down the stairs after she said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out his voice as if he was relying on that back. There was still mountain worth of things he doesn't know. He felt that he must not let Origami go back now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can we talk----a little longer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it's already time for class you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't have to be today! If you have a free day----can I meet you again then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Isn't that--------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami made a surprised look and her cheeks blushed next.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing that reaction, Shidou noticed it one beat later and [Ah] his face turned red.</p>
<p class="null-p">---That way of talking sounds just sounds as if I was inviting her to a date…….!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was being flustered on how he should take fix those words, Origami looked away while opening her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….er, can you give me some time to think about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh? O-of course……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou replied by reflex, Origami bowed down at the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'll be going now"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then jogged down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">……..Honestly, it was an unexpected scene. She's girlish………….he feels bad to the Origami of the previous world for saying this but, her reaction does not look like it belongs to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slowly swung his head. Origami must be a girl like this in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her personality turned to a calm and rational stance because of her parent's death.</p>
<p class="null-p">But……………what is this weird feeling. He feels that the current Origami is cute but, his heart feels somewhat lonely or it feels like it is lacking something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….i might have gotten too used to the old Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou mocked himself, he followed Origami and went down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">While tiredly mumbling to himself and walking through the corridor, he reached the 2nd year class 4. The English teacher entered the classroom immediately and the 5th period started.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-----after who knows how long passed since class started.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Origami, who was sitting on his left side, started making odd movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling something was off, Shidou looked over there to see Origami tearing a piece of paper from the edge of her note and writing something on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then folded it into half and placed it at the edge of Shidou's table while avoiding the teacher's eyes. It's like what Shidou did during class at 1st period.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou received it, Origami's cheeks blushed and after a moment of looking around in a chaotic manner, she made her textbook stand and hid her face inside.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After school on that day. Shidou went up the school roof alone and while he was leaning on the floor, he was staring at the clouds drifting in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">He took out the folded piece of paper from his pocket and held it up to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">---"I am free this Saturday"</p>
<p class="null-p">That paper was given by Origami just now. It looks like the reply to Shidou's invitation. There was a small mail address written under it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Saturday……..huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, he put the paper back into his pocket and took a light stretch.</p>
<p class="null-p">He managed to make a promise. Without <Ratatoskr>'s help, and judging by the fact that it's a girl he first met tentatively; it wouldn't be exaggerated to say that he gained a big gold star of excellence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, there was still a mountain worth of problems.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place, was it really possible for Origami, who turned into a Spirit and inversed to not know what happened to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Several thinkable possible conclusions popped up in Shidou's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">The dumbest and yet the most possible one, was that it was all Shidou's misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that he saw Origami in the video Kotori showed him. But, he can't deny the fact that another Spirit might have an Astral Dress that look exactly like Origami's.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's next was simply the possibility that Origami was lying. It didn't look like it to Shidou but, it's not like Shidou studied criminal psychology nor was he a famous gambler. It's more than enough to think that he was tricked by Origami's acting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or maybe------</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, that there are 2 Origamis……………there is no way right……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou mumbled that and laughed tiredly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, he has to consult <Ratatoskr>including with that matter.</p>
<p class="null-p">But………….Shidou *Fuaaaa* leaked a big yawn when he was about to raise his body. At the same time, he felt his body gradually relaxing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only normal for that to happen to him. He has been searching through the database the whole night yesterday so; he didn't had a good sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ori…….gami…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou mumbled that name before closing his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">After who knows how long passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes after leaking a soft moan.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds, his mind awakened and he noticed that he fell asleep. It seems he was tired beyond his expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah………this is bad. What time is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou frowned his eyebrows from the odd feeling when he took his phone out from his pocket to check the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Something feels different from before he fell asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few moments of thinking, Shidou realized the identity of the problem.---it was a pillow. Even though Shidou did not place anything under his head, he could feel something oddly soft under there right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was about to extend his hand to under his head to confirm the identity of that feeling, a girl immediately fell into Shidou's view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------Oh my, pranks are a no no"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He suddenly widens his eyes from the surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Late after a beat, he realized the identity of the feeling under his head----and also the girl.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Ku…Kurumi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He called the girls name with a screechy voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The girl that entered Shidou's view was the Spirit-Tokisaki Kurumi, who sent Shidou back 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that Kurumi was giving a lap pillow before Shidou noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, nice to meet you, Shidou-san. Your sleeping face was cute"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was really embarrassing so, Shidou jumped off Kurumi's lap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, oh my"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi giggled because Shidou's reaction was funny to her, before standing up with elegant movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's outfit was not the usual red-black Astral Dress that he was used to seeing. It was the Raizen high school uniform that Shidou saw when he first met Kurumi. Her long bangs were covering her left eye which was carved with the number of the clock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi, you…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's body got nervous at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that Shidou thinks about, there might be a chance that the Kurumi existing in this world might not have the same memories as the Kurumi Shidou knew. Shidou was forced to know that today. It was a normal procedure to be cautious around the worst Spirit-Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, after Kurumi widen her eyes, she placed her hand on her mouth and laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay, you don't have to be that cautious, Shido-san. If I wanted to [Eat]</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou-san then, I would have done so when you were sleeping defenselessly" "Uu…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's just as Kurumi says. Sweat flow down Shidou's cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, she's not someone to be relaxed around with. Even though Shidou agreed with Kurumi's words, he kept a watchful eye at her behavior without lowering his guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my. How distrustful.-------we are comrades that changed the world after all"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Kurumi shrug her shoulders jokingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes when he heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….! Kurumi, you-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I remember. I know of the previous world.----and Origami-san too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt goosebumps when Kurumi said that name.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's obvious. Other than himself, she was the first person in this world he met that knows of Origami. It's like a traveler who was thrown in the desert finding a guide. Shidou halted his clingy emotions to Kurumi and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi, listen to this. There is something wrong with this world. Origami-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----She became a Spirit, right"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said it as if to cover Shidou's words. Shidou widen his eyes in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………, You knew?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I found out just now though"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slightly looked downwards before he continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just……….what is going on? Did something happen to Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I am not sure what it is. Hooweveeer-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Kurumi made a spin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's the Origami-san now then……it's not like there is no way to find out"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Re-really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi smiled, she used her heel and stepped onto the roof. When she did that; the shadow lurking under Kurumi's foot covered her body and formed the red-black dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Astral Dress. The castle and armor protecting the Spirits. Shidou glared at her cautiously when Kurumi suddenly manifested that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, please don't look so scary"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said that while holding up her right hand. A long pistol jumped out from the shadow when she did that before settling down in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi licked her lips and continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I use this [Yud] and shoot Origami-san then I can find out just what life she has been going through in this world. Well of course, I can't take everything in but, if I focus on the point on how she become a Spirit then, I think I can gain the information you wish for"</p>
<p class="null-p">"[Yud]………..i get it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes. [Yud]. If he was correct, that bullet will give Kurumi the target's past memories. If she uses that, she will probably be able to gain the knowledge on what happened to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But………if that's the case then, you could have just used [Yud] on the Inverse Origami of the previous world to find the cause right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked her without any particular reason, Kurumi shrugged her shoulders exaggeratedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well-----That will happen according to theory. This only happens if I managed to get close to that Origami-san and shoot her with [Yud]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's cheeks twitched. It's true that, she don't have such a time for such a leisure activity, if she was dealing with the Inversed Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-anyway, we will be able to find the cause for Origami inversing in this world if we have that right? I am counting on you, Kurumi. Lend me your power"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, what should I do"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi placed her gun mouth at her lips as if she was enjoying this.</p>
<p class="null-p">After school. Origami, who was on her way back alone, came back to Raizen high school.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was one reason. When she was going back home, she noticed the hair ornament she usually wear, was missing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's didn't really hurt for losing one small pin but-----it's a different story if it's the one bought by her late mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, it's not like she knew clearly where she dropped it. In the end, Origami followed back the path she walked and after looking through the, entrance, corridor and classroom, she reached the stairs leading to the roof where she spoke with Itsuka Shidou during the afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah----found it"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami lean down, she then picked up the pin dropped on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looks like she dropped it when she was talking to Shidou. It probably happened when she grabbed his hands excitedly when she found out that he was brothers with the boy of that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to be careful……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">While mumbling that, Origami simply cleaned the pin with her fingers before wearing it on her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami saw 2 people on the roof through the glass.</p>
<p class="null-p">One was her classmate, Itsuka Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the other person------was the Spirit-<Nightmare>wearing her red-black Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she recognized that,</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's consciousness got shut down as if there was a power outage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt that he heard a creaking door opened at the direction of the roof entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked over there, he saw a girl standing there looking downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-re…….Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. He couldn't see who it was for a moment there since she was looking downwards but------it was definitely Tobiichi Origami. Even though class was over just what business does she have here?</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was questioning that, he quickly stopped his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Shidou recalled back the Spirit- Kurumi standing beside him right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this world, Origami was also affiliated with the AST until a while back. Which means, the possibility that she saw Kurumi was not zero. At the very least, she probably saw her in documented videos.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-origami, this is err"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he managed to make a promise with her, it won't be good if she make a weird misunderstanding. Shidou raised his voice to somehow fool her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami continued looking down as if she could not hear Shidou's voice and while both her hands were limp, she slowly walked forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my oh my?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou called her name suspiciously, Kurumi distorted her eyebrows to match with him. Afterwards, after the shadow wrapped Kurumi and covered her in black, she immediately returned to original appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time meeting you in this world……….i think right, Origamisan? Well, there might be a chance that you met me before but-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spi-rit………"</p>
<p class="null-p">---and.</p>
<p class="null-p">Half-way through Kurumi's words, Origami mumbled that before jet black darkness spread out from her body like a spider's web.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene was like, only the surroundings around Origami turned into night time. Shidou widen his eyes in reflex when he saw that weird scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, the darkness swirling around Origami entangled to her body and formed into a mourning dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was definitely----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Astral Dress…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a voice filled with surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It was the Spirit's armor- the Astral Dress that Origami, who appeared on the roof, was wearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more, it wasn't the pure wedding dress like the one Shidou saw but instead it was the black dress after she inversed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, the area was filled with strong gravity and a nervousness which was strong to make breathing hard. His legs were slightly trembling, and he was close to collapsing if he ever relaxed.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was the most natural thing ever. The [Demon King] that is the avatar of destruction and holds tremendous power. That was what manifested in front of his eyes right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I thought------You're <Devil>……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami did not answer even when Shidou asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that was the only thinkable answer now that he saw her like this. At the very least, it wasn't Shidou's misunderstanding. If that is the case then, it would mean that Origami was lying as expected. It didn't felt like it at that time but-----</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san, standing there might be dangerous you know"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi suddenly said that to him when he was thinking in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, several clusters of darkness popped out around the silent Origami; it then expanded and formed a giant [Wing].</p>
<p class="null-p">He saw that before. It was the appearance of the angel that destroyed the city of the previous world with raining beams-----her inversed form.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………<Demon king of Salvation(Satan)>………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami mumbled that, the countless [Wing] pointed its tip towards their direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His body froze from the sudden event. In the next moment, Shidou *Don* was pushed aside.</p>
<p class="null-p">One beat later, he noticed that it was Kurumi that pushed Shidou aside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was already too late when he noticed that; Kurumi already jumped up to the sky. The beams shot by the [Wing] shot towards the spot where Kurumi used to be at just now, pierced through the school fence and flew into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was----quite a violent greeting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi shouted, she then pulled the trigger of her pistol. When she did that, harden shadow bullets were shot towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the [Wing] floating around Origami extended out into a shield and easily blocked the attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">The remaining [Wing] pointed its tip towards Kurumi up at the sky and----- "Kuh-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">The black beam was shot towards the defenseless Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">The beam pierced through Kurumi's chest and stomach; her head and limbs were also severed. The silhouette of a delicate girl was reduced to a pitiful corpse within an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to match with Shidou's shout, the parts which used to be Kurumi fell down from the sky. The same time they touched the ground, they started disintegrating like ash.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Origami, you-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lifted his face and stopped his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh----?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He then let out a dumbfounded voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's obvious on why he did so. Origami, who killed Kurumi, fell to her knees powerlessly and the countless [Wing] floating around her turned into light particles before disappearing into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">And right after that, the black Astral Dress decorating Origami's body opened and she returned back to the uniform appearance, similar to what she was in just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's as if------she achieved her goal by killing Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……is this………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was unable to understand the event happening in front of him and after a while later, Origami slowly lifted her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Ah-re, Itsuka-kun? What are you doing in a place like this"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she recognized Shidou, she said that in a surprised manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's eyes turned black and white at that unexpected response.</p>
<p class="null-p">That un-malicious expression and tone doesn't make him feel that she shot Kurumi just now. If that was acting then, she would be a famous actress that will leave her name in history, or a genius criminal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the heck…..is this……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou mumbled in a dumbfounded manner, Origami tilted her head in wonder. However, rather than directing that response to Shidou, it looks like she was trying to recall back why she was on the roof.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps, it happened again……."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami said that softly, *Pan**pan* she dust her lap while standing up on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again? Wha-what again…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah……..you heard me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami awkwardly scratched her head when she heard Shido's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, my consciousness has been shutting down recently. I think its anemia or something though…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your consciousness………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought his eyebrows closer while he gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked at Shidou oddly before [Ah] she raised a voice as if she recalled something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, now that I think about it; did you read the paper I gave you in class?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh……..?Y-yeah……..i read it"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou answered, Origami turned around and faced her back at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, so that's it……you see"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she ran away from the roof.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah------"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was too late even though he tried to stop her. Origami entered the school and *Ton**ton* went down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having left alone on the roof, Shidou stood still blankly for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami appeared, turn into her Inverse spirit form, killed Kurumi and left without knowing anything. The whole event probably only took 5 minutes. However, Shidou's surrounding made a weird turn in that small time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou called her name and,</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Yes yes, did you call?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou felt a shadow appearing beside him, Kurumi, who was killed by Origami just now, popped her head out from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, you don't look that shocked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Something similar happened once before"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his head while answering her. Most likely, she probably switched with her clone at the point when Origami appeared. "………….I don't like the way you use and throw away your clones. Even though they might be clones, they are still alive right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, Shidou-san you are so kind. But you need not worry. It is possible to recreate the [Me] that got killed just now with the [8th bullet(Het)]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">He silently exhaled. His and Kurumi's value to life is too far apart.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that Kurumi will not talk about that matter anymore. She looked towards the direction where Origami disappeared to, to change the topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think about that Origami-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……even if you ask me that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly, he doesn't know. He made a troubled expression and placed his hand on his chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, one thing is for certain; Using [10th bullet (Yud)] to gain information looks tough……..and that's fact"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……true"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no clue on what kind of situation Origami was in right now but, there was no mistake that she turned into her Spirit form when saw Kurumi. It will be tough getting close to her like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why………..did this happen. I-----is what I did, a mistake…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that painfully, Kurumi *Fuu* sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think so. If you didn't save Origami-san's parents at that time then, the</p>
<p class="null-p">Tenguu city of this world should be trampled mercilessly by the inversed</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami. This situation is not the [Worst]…don't you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-that might be true but…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou hesitated when he was told that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like he didn't understand what Kurumi meant. Thinking of what happened in the previous world; this world right now could be called peaceful.</p>
<p class="null-p">But…………Shidou couldn't agree with this. Just what happened to Origami after that? He got curious about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi *Giggled* maybe she saw Shidou's expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I know Shidou-san would feel that way.------it's true that even I am interested on how the world was rewritten by just changing one event"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Then-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stopped his words when he reached that point. Kurumi erected one finger and blocked Shidou's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Howww everrr……….i am not that kind you know. Anything further up here, will require another fee okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, *Nii* she distorted her lips. Shidou gulped when he saw that gruesome smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi shrugged her shoulders when she saw Shidou's appearance and spin around one more time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay then, I will be leaving now.----let's meet again, Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving only that, Kurumi disappeared into the shadows.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----So"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou got back home, Kotori, who was waiting for him with her blackribbon commander mode, said that while making the rod of the chupa chups in her mouth stand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you explain what is going on, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she said that, she glared at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clearly knows the reason for this.------it was about Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were 3 people right now in the Itsuka family living room. One was Shidou, the other was Kotori and the last one was a sleepy woman, who has prepared a small tab with her already. It's <Ratatoskr>'s analyst officer-Murasame Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-even Reine-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Hnn, well, think of me as a secretary substitute. I will leave if it's inconvenient for you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no that isn't true……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his cheeks while saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't a single Spirit around and they were probably told to stay in the mansion. Looks like they really want to hear Shidou's circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, go on Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori jerk her chin to urge him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah………."</p>
<p class="null-p">However. Even though he was overpowered by the atmosphere, Shidou stilled hesitated.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that, he would tell them his situation when he gets back home, in order to gain help from <Ratatoskr>. But, the moment when the time comes, he felt lost on how to explain the event that happened to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori snorted unhappily maybe because she guessed Shidou's thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..Fuun. What, can't talk after reaching to this point? Or maybe, are you feeling uneasy that I can't understand Shidou's talk? Don't look down on me. I wonder if Shidou looks at me as a unreliable commander?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I didn't plan to do that"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou swung his head, Kotori pouted her lips as if she was sulking and leaked out a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………Why can't you count on me a little more……Onii-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes after Kotori told him that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then scratched his head before making a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….that's right. Sorry about that, Kotori"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a self-admonition, Shidou slightly lowered his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Just, why must he be that scared? Kotori, the girl in front of Shidou is much smarter than him and is a very strong girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This might sound weird but, what I am going to tell you is undeniable truth.-----Will you listen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Kotori's expression brightens up in an instant. But, she quickly twitched her eyebrows and returned to her commander mode face before nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, of course"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou made a wry smile at Kotori, he started talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">About, the fact that he was acquainted with the girl called Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">About, the fact Origami turned into a Spirit, inversed and destroyed the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">About, the fact Shidou traveled back in time 5 years using Kurumi's power to prevent that; and by saving Origami's parents, he managed to change the route for the world to move to.</p>
<p class="null-p">About, the fact that Origami exists in this world as the Spirit called <Devil>.</p>
<p class="null-p">---It took around 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou calmly revealed his experience to Kotori and Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..and, that's about it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he finished his story, Kotor *Guuu* groaned before making a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Rewriting the world……..i see. I finally understand why Shidou acted weird yesterday"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that and placed her hands on her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I will believe you for now. There is nothing that comes to mind for Shidou to lie to me. Also----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori signaled to Reine. Reine [……….hn] made a short reply and after she manipulated the tab in her hand, she faced the screen towards their direction. "Hnn……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou peeked into the screen before gasping.</p>
<p class="null-p">The image shown was the appearance of Inversed Origami standing on the high school roof. At the edge of the picture, Shidou and Kurumi were there. It was exactly the scene Shidou just experienced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. This is the image taken by the automated camera on today's</p>
<p class="null-p">evening………we sent several camera to look for information regarding Tobiichi Origami but, I never would have thought to see this decisive moment" Kotori made a painful face while *Fuumu* groaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tobiichi Origami is definitely <Devil>. But, she does not know about it………actually, I had Reine analyze her parameters but, she wasn't lying at all"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, as expected………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There is a possibility that Tobiichi Origami has not realized that she turned into a Spirit"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gulped when he heard Kotori's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that….even possible?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a pattern we never seen before but……as long as there is a real example here, we can't deny that fact. I have no clue on why this happened though"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kotori said that, Reine, who was manipulating the tab made a small sigh while stroking her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….can I say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn, what's wrong Reine"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Hn. This is just my speculations or just my reasoning but, there is a point I question in Shin's story"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question…..? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine nodded before continuing after hearing Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………aah, Shidou succeeded in changing the world. And, everyone does not remember the previous world………..you said that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The only ones that know about the previous world is me and Kurumi"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………That's it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou tilted his head, Reine erected one finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..I just wondered why you and Kurumi are the only ones that have the memories of the previous world. Kurumi might be okay because of her ability but, I don't get the reason regarding Shin's case"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuuun………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he was told that; she's right. Shidou was the one that changed the world so………..he was satisfied with that thought but, it's true that his current self is the Shidou, who has lived in the new world he created. He doesn't know of the clear answer on why he has memories of the previous world when instead, he shouldn't be having any of those memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….most likely, there must be some kind of condition to save your memories of the previous world"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Condition……what kind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….i don't know the details. If we leave Kurumi out as an exception then the sample cases we have is too little. But for example, let's say that the condition is [Getting shot by Kurumi's [Yud Bet] and [Have Reiryoku]……….how about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"? And that's…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou made a troubled face, Kotori sitting opposite him [Ahh] widen her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, if several conditions are needed then………..the moment Tobiichi</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami received Reiryoku by <Phantom>, there is a possibility that she will recall back the memories of the previous world. Regardless the fact that she has memories of this world……………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou finally understood after he heard Kotori's explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-wait just a second there Reine-san. Which means……..are you saying that the Inversed Origami [Is the Origami that regained back the memories of the previous world]……..?</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine quietly closed her eyes at Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….I said this already. This is just my speculations. It's just a possibility. But…………its fact that thing makes sense if it is thought that way"</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-but………..Origami was normal when she came to school------forget that, she should be the Origami that has memories of the previous world right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………I won't know the details unless we ask Kurumi but, unlike Shin, who has his memories of the previous world in the first place; Origami has memories of this world. Just what would happen if memories regarding the previous world were forcefully poured into her mind…………. I don't think it would give a good effect to the owner of those memories, at the very least. In order to protect herself, it is possible to think that the Origami who has memories of this world and the Origami who has the memories of the previous world, is separated"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..the thinkable switch that will call out the Origami who has memories of the previous world would be-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----The existence of Spirit's……..so to speak"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori made the rod of the Chupa Chups stand and said that. Reine […….Most likely] agreed with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………judging by her reaction when Tohka was in class, she might only react to Reiryoku. If that is the case then………..it is extremely dangerous to manifest the limit Astral Dress in front of her"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that Origami turned into a Spirit when she saw Kurumi. And, she returned back to the normal Origami after she killed Kurumi. "B-but……….if that really is true then, what should we-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that with a trembling voice, Kotori quickly interrupted him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be true that our opponent is the deadliest and worst inverse Spirit</p>
<p class="null-p"><Devil>. But, turning it to the other side, she will only turn into a Spirit in special conditions even though she has tremendous Reiryoku"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said that much before clenching his fist.-----it was just as Kotori says. Nothing will start if he keeps running.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----This might be an irregular case but, as long as we know that Tobiichi Origami is <Devil>; there is only one thing <Ratatoskr>will do"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori looked towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">It needs not to be said. Shidou pulled his lips and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Ratatoskr>'s philosophy; to pacify the Spirits which is the cause of the Space Quake with peaceful means.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in order to achieve that, one method is needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that's-----to [Date them and make them fall for him].</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori made a satisfied nod when she saw Shidou's response before putting the rod of the Chupa chups between her fingers and pointing it at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….so with that decided, let's start moving immediately tomorrow. Shidou, somehow take contact with Origami and invite her to a date. The latest is within this week"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……that's right"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou recalled something and [Ah] let out his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I already did that…….a date promise. She told me that her Saturday was empty…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shouted loudly maybe because Shidou's answer was very unexpected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what's with that? Did you have a love chat before our observation results? Shidou you did that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no…….i didn't really love chat with her…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………...then why did the topic change to dating"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well that's because…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was having problems answering, Kotori *Jiii* stared at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuuun……………….looks like I need to hear what kind of relationship you had with Tobiichi Origami in the previous world"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what are you……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">With hand movements like a cat cornering a mouse, Kotori patted Shidou's chin. Shidou's face turned pale at that weird sensation.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….aaaaahhhhhh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Night time. While lying down on her bed, Origami hugged her long pillow and was rolling around.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. She was currently embarrassed at her own actions she took today.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was him that invited her, that reply was just too maiden-like. Not only that, she even met up with him again on the roof. What kind of female manga main character are you!? It was a situation where she wanted to retort that to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">---but. After Origami exhaled, she faced upwards from the bed and gazed up at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">That young man…………….the moment she saw Itsuka Shidou's face, she was really surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">The young man carved deep inside Origami's memories. Shidou really looks identical to the young man that sacrificed himself to save Origami's parents 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe that's the reason; an odd emotion attacked Origami the moment she saw Shidou's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">No---that wasn't all.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she heard his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she smelled him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she touched his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Origami felt an indescribable emotion in her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what was that? It was not disgusting. However, the weird feeling felt like she was tickled from inside her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….don't tell me this is"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami let out a soft voice. An unidentified emotion. A feeling she has never felt before. This might possibly be-----</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, her cell phone left beside her pillow received a message.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sudden ringtone caused her to bounce up.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then calmed down by taking a breath and after extending her hands to the cell phone beside the pillow, she found that the sender of the mail was Shidou when she looked at the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant she recognized that, her heart started pounded so hard that she does not even know why.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, she can't stay frozen like this forever. She took a deep breath before fiddling with the screen and read through the text.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was written there was an apology for suddenly inviting her today, a text that he will be honored to see her again and also, the time and meeting place for Saturday.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa-wawah"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami dropped the cell phone into her hands as if she held onto a heated rock, she started rolling on the bed in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">She can't calm down for some reason. Her head was in chaos even though she only received one mail from a boy she just met today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….! O-oh yeah, a reply----"</p>
<p class="null-p">After 10 seconds of chaos, Origami finally recalled back what she should be doing and poured in strength on the cell phone's keypad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..meeting spot and time understood. Okay……"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, her hands stopped right before sending the mail.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Is this reply really okay? Is this just too simple for all that matters?</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami silently erased her text, she fixed her posture and retyped the mail again.</p>
<p class="null-p">She replied back to Shidou's mail with each words typed in carefully; she expressed poetically that she was happy to talk to him, she can't wait for next Saturday and she would get a strange feeling every time she thinks about Shidou. But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……am I a maiden, seriously!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling embarrassed half-way through, Origami's cheeks blushed before erasing the text again.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Origami only managed to send a mail reply to Shidou on the next day.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">11th of November, Saturday.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou walked to the Tenguu station alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky was clear blue. Although the air was a little chilly, the sun was warm and it doesn't feel like the temperature of a day closing to winter. It was the best weather for a date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------even so, aren't you a little too early? The promised time is at 11 right?" Kotori's voice could be heard from the small Incam equipped in his right ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">This Incam was connected to the airship <Fraxinus>floating about Shidou's spot approximately by 15000 meters and the whole crew in that bridge will be providing support to Shidou's date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied back softly while taking a glance at his cell phone's screen. 10:12 am. There was still 48 minutes until the meeting time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It won't be weird if Origami is already here. Of course, I can't say that this Origami is slightly different from the one I know but…………it's better than making her wait long right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Kotori [Fuuun………..] talked with a meaning behind her voice, through the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are quite informed huh-----for just a mere classmate"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said it with thorns in her tone. Shidou made a dry smile while sweat was flowing down his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she asked his relationship with the Origami in the previous world, he replied that as his answer but………..it looks like, Kotori didn't believe him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………it was because of you all that I became acquainted with Origami in the first place, know this"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou twitched his cheeks while complaining to the Incam. Actually, even though it started because of the event in 5 years ago, the reason why Shidou started talking to Origami frequently was because of the [Training] Kotori proposed and the love chat with Origami. He told that to Kotori too just in case but……..</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows~~I don't know what you are talking about"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality; the Kotori of this world probably has no memories of saying that. Shidou clenched his teeth, wondering how to reply back.</p>
<p class="null-p">He reached the station hall right when they were talking about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">The meeting place with Origami was in front of the fountain in the station hall. It was the same meeting spot when he had to go through a triple booking date with Tohka and Kurumi too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having stepped into the hall, Shidou let out a short word and stopped on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Origami was already in front of the fountain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, it's not like he was shocked to see Origami there. The reason why Shidou stopped there for a moment was because of her clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was in a blouse with a cute design, and a cardigan. A skirt with autumn colors. Shidou's eyes were stolen away unintentionally when he saw that girly style that doesn't fit with the Origami in his memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….! Y-yeah"</p>
<p class="null-p">He twitched his body when Kotori called him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa………the future looks bleak"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-sorry………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please focus. I don't know what happened in the previous world but, at the very least, the girl in front of you right now is the Spirit hunter <Devil>. We don't know what she would do if you lower your guard. Please go in with the preparations of handling Tokisaki Kurumi"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori warned him. Shidou took a deep breath to arrange his heart beat before tilting his head forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah I understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori *suuu* exhaled before,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay-----let's begin our dateWar"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, and announced the start of the plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Shidou started moving his legs, which he stopped, towards the fountain.</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably noticed him when he did that. Origami, who was standing in front of the fountain, lifted her face and looked surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-kun? You are so early"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……….that goes for us too right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Origami looked at the clock standing in the hall, and shrunk her shoulders in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, I didn't want to make you wait"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I thought that too"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami widen her eyes after said that. After a while, she leaked a carefree smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for inviting me for today, Itsuka-kun………..but err, this may sound embarrassing but, I have no experience going out alone with a guy so, there might be unforeseen problems"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no no, even I don't have that experience"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou swung his head at Origami's words. When he did that, Kotori's voice echoed in his right ears to retort him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm amazed that you can say that after dating that many Spirits"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shu-shut up"</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What are you saying, Itsuka-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami tilted her head in wonder. Shidou quickly [No, nothing] played it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather………….we are classmates so, can you stop the honorifics?" "But"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, it will make me feel awkward. So please?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said that before clapping his hands together; Origami made her eyebrows look like a 八 shape for a while but, she nodded in understanding soon later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand……..err……….i get it"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said it with an unfamiliar manner. Shidou relaxed his cheeks in nostalgia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha………..Origami have to be like that, as expected"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami let out a dumb-witted voice at Shidou's words. He realized that he called her [Origami] unconsciously again like what he did few days ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…….Sorry, I called you in reflex. Err…….it's because it's a beautiful name"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tried to play it off. He wasn't lying but, in reality, the reason was leaning more towards the fact he called her that in the previous world. He used to call her Tobiichi at first but, he gotten used to calling her name before he noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked restless but, she doesn't look bad. Her mouth made a broad smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. -------It's the name my father and mother gave me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Father and mother. Those worlds made Shidou feel something complex spreading out in him.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami slightly looked away while moving her lips, maybe because she noticed what Shidou was thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, I don't mind-----if Itsuka-kun calls me that way"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, I mean Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that with slightly blushing cheeks. Shidou's heart pounded unexpectedly when he saw that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, why are you keeping quiet! Your partner finally got closer you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickly continued his words when Kotori's words came into his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-thanks…….Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was a name he said out naturally just now, it turned out embarrassing now that he officially gain permission for do so. Just like him, Origami slightly looked away from his eyes and replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah---then, about that. You can call me Shidou if you want. It will be unfair if you don't"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami widen her eyes in reflex when Shidou said that. And after mumbling something softly, she let out her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shid-----, ……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, after he stopped his words half-way, he scratched his cheeks in a restless manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….I don't mind until you get used to it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Aah, o-of course!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou agreed, a few seconds of silence flowed by.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou I don't recommend staying quiet for too long. Anything is okay, just connect the lines"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's command flew to him. It was just as she says. He looked for a topic in his head before moving his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey err"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, his voice covered Origami voice too. A strange embarrassing feeling attacked them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was the one that broke that situation first. She looked back at Shidou and asked him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I think about it, Itsuka-kun, what are we doing today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. But, I only heard about the time and meeting place"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah, I forgotten about that. Today------"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, he heard a certain sound which he has not heard for a long time in his right ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now in the bridge of the airship- <Fraxinus>floating 15000 meters up the Tenguu city, <Ratatoskr>'s elites were lined up inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under Kotori's orders, all of the elite love masters were to support Shidou. Everyone was maintaining an ideal nervous situation while looking at the giant main monitor installed in the bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">The image of the ground sent by the automate camera was shown in the main monitor. As if to trace Shidou's view point, the target for this time-Tobiichi Origami's picture was zoomed in, several different angles were taken from the cameras nearby and all sorts of parameters were on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And---right now. The moment Origami asked a question, *Pikon!* such a sound echoed in the bridge and a window was displayed on the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The choices are out………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, who's sitting on the commander seat located at the upper bridge, was moving the rod of the Chupa chups up and down while hitting her lap.</p>
<p class="null-p">The AI installed in the <Fraxinus>, will observe the target's the movements of her emoitions and will show 3 choices for Shidou to pick.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Actually, there is a movie I want to watch with you] watch a romance movie in the cinema.</p>
<p class="null-p">[I was thinking of shopping] enjoy shopping.</p>
<p class="null-p">[Let's stop with the annoying parts] straight to an adult hotel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All members, your choice!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Obeying Kotori's order, the crews clicked on the button at their hands reach at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately, the total votes were displayed on the main monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">The most was----②.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fumu………② huh. It's the safe road huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori stroke her chin, a crew member at the lower deck; <Bad Marriage>Kawagoe raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's hard to throw ① away but, going to a space with no conversation at the first go will make things uneasy"</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards, <Deprive>Minowa opened her lips to show her agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Rather, why did ③ suddenly appear in the choices………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone wasn't disagreeing and nodded. Within them, sweat was flowing down the <Nail knocker>Shiizaki's cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We won't know unless we ask <Fraxinus>'s AI"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shrugs her shoulders while saying that. In reality, Kotori tried to lure Shidou and Tohka to a hotel to rest during Tohka's conquest but, that was because the Spirit knows nothing about this world (This was a digression but, if Shidou was about to do something above a kiss then, it was planned that an organization member disguised as a garbage collector will step in).</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the target this time was previously a human. Which means, the probability that she knows about what [That] was built for, was high. If someone was brought to a place like that on a first that then getting slapped can't be arguable.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori brought the mike closer, she threw an order to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, I decided. -----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----wait for a sec"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou interrupted Kotori's voice with a whisper soft enough to avoid Origami from hearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..I have something I want to test out with those choices"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She widens her eyes at Shidou's unusual serious voice. This was the first time Shidou said this.</p>
<p class="null-p">However; she noticed something. The Spirit this time-----Tobiichi Origami was a special girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Shidou's words were correct; this world was a world branched out from the events from 5 years ago-----and Shidou might be intimate with Origami in another parallel world.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that's the case then, it won't be weird for Shidou to already know about Origami's tastes that they have not yet grasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a moment of thinking, Kotori flicked the rod of her Chupa chups.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----I get it. It's special this time. Please choose the choices you like, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori said that, Shidou poked the Incam silently to show that he understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">The main monitor then moved towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Origami. There's somewhere I want to go so, can i?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, okay"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami nodded and followed after Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, after a while of walking. Shidou suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked up at the building in front of her, and made a blank face.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was only normal. That's because, the place Shidou brought Origami was a castle-like building with lodging fees and resting fees posted on the signboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">A very loud alarm echoed inside the bridge immediately. At the same time, <President>Mikimoto and <Dimension Breaker>Nakatsugawa were shouting while they were looking at their personal monitors.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The emotion values are not stabilizing"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tobiichi Origami! Is feeling shaken!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Obviously, just what are you thinking Shidouuuuuuu!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori shouted, she tugged the mike closer to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou! Play it off before Origami gets angry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? But"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hurry up before it's too late!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori said that, Shidou faked looking lost for a moment before making a smile to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, over here, come"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah………this isn't the place"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami exhaled in relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-well of course. Come on, let's go"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-un"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought Origami pass the hotel. The alarm then finally stopped ringing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa…………what were you thinking Shidou. It's so obvious that she would pull back if she was brought to a place like that in her first date"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori wiped the sweat on her forehead, Shidou made a confused face while letting out a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. I thought this would definitely be the spot for Origami………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, why is that"</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not understand why Shidou fixed Origami and a hotel together. She replied back with twitching cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, pick . Go shopping"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….i got it"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou nodded and told Origami that they were going shopping.</p>
<p class="null-p">While looking at the scene on the main monitor, Kotori talked to the crew at the lower deck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, how is Origami's affection level? It would be nice if it didn't drop much though………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-about that……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakatsugawa fixed his glasses position in a troubled manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her emotion values were shaken greatly but……….her affection level has not dropped at all……..no, instead, it slightly got higher……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori raised a doubtful voice at Nakatsugawa's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">While accompanying Origami, they passed the back alley and walked straight into the main street.</p>
<p class="null-p">Half-way through, Origami suddenly raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, where are we going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I thought of going shopping"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou asked, Origami tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you shopping for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……Errr……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thinks about it, they haven't decided on what to shop for. He scratched his cheeks while immersed in thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop. The choices are out"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's voice then appeared in the Incam in his right ear and the automated voice message read out the choices.</p>
<p class="null-p">3 choices were displayed on the bridge's main monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Coordinate her in a selection shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Play with animals in a pet shop and shrink their distances.</p>
<p class="null-p">Go to a pharmacy located at the back alley's which sells strong vitality drinks and aphrodisiacs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, you're choice!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The total votes were displayed on the monitor once Kotori shouted. The votes were at ① which was the most while ② was close by a slim margin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"① huh. Same with me"</p>
<p class="null-p">The crew replied back to Kotori's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, those are appropriate"</p>
<p class="null-p">"② isn't bad but, we don't know if she likes animal or not"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………rather, what is with this ③? This feels kind of special but………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kawagoe raised his eyebrows and asked. It's true that only one choice was a different kind. What's the AI thinking?……….is a big scale maintenance needed?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, you hear me? Let's be appropriate and go with ①-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it has to be ③"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the opposite side of the Incam, Shidou let out his voice naturally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She brought her eyebrows closer at Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying Shidou. Please calm down. It's obviously not a place for a teenager to go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but its Origami we are talking about here……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does that mean!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She does not understand. Kotori shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you ask me what……………..speaking of Origami, it's going to be vitality drinks; speaking of vitality drinks, it will be Origami I guess"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said it as if it was common sense. Kotori placed her hands on her head at that direct manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No seriously, I don't understand. Just what kind of girl is [Tobiichi Origami] that you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh………? Let's see, she's someone that would make me drink the combination of boiled mixed vitality drinks, she would install traps to prevent me from running away from her house, and she would lick my neck when I give her a piggyback ride….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa!? Are you joking here? There's no way such a girl would exist!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-even if you tell me that……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou distorted his eyebrows in a troubled manner. It looks like he was not joking and was serious about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Kotori recalled back the Tobiichi Origami's affection level movements from just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was shaken from that overly unexpected choice, her affection did not drop at all. Possibly this might…………</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori settled her thoughts in 2 seconds, *Fuun* she sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….okay. Go try it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Commander!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A surprised voice came down from the lower deck. However, Kotori did not look away from the main monitor and continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As replacement, if her affection level drops even a bit or her emotion level turns unstable then, quickly move to . Okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah, I get it"</p>
<p class="null-p">After replying to her, Shidou brought Origami into the back alley.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------okay, this is the place if I am correct"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami opened her eyes wide in shock when Shidou stopped his legs in front a certain pharmacy in the back-alley.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was normal. It looks like a multi-tenant building at first glance. However, after entering the building and heading up to the 2nd floor, a pharmacy with a ghost house-like interior. It's a secretive spot that won't be discovered unless a person was living a normal life. If Shidou wasn't told about the existence of this shop by Origami in the previous world then, he probably wouldn't be able to reach here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Packaged bottle not commonly seen in drug stores were overflowing the shop. The words written on the label were clearly not Japanese giving this place a 100% for strangeness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What………is this shop?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami asked dubiously. But, as expected he couldn't say [Origami is a regular customer here right], and made something up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, let's take a look. Let's go somewhere else if you don't like it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-un………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked around the strange medicines lined up in the shop curiously. However, some of it didn't make sense to her and would sometimes tilt her head………Is her taste different than the Origami Shidou knew?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If that was the case then, it might be a good idea to quickly change his objectives like what Kotori said. If he was correct, Kotori's orders were to bring Origami to see clothes, about that? Well, that choice was undeniable correct for a normal girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami talked to Shidou when he was thinking that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I thought………I don't understand anything. Let's go somewhere else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah, I see. Sorry----"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou stopped his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Origami was making her eyebrows into a 八 shape because she was troubled when she was looking at the products lined up in the shop but…………….she was holding a shopping basket filled with the shop's most effective looking vitality drinks and aphrodisiacs in the shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, what's that……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou pointed at it, Origami opened her eyes wide in surprise as if she just realized that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-this is………..when did I…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami pressed her forehead and was wobbling as if she was feeling lightheaded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ar-are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Shidou quickly supported her body, a loud alarm echoed inside the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou! Origami's emotion values are making strong waves!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Le-let's go out for now! Okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou heard Kotori's voice and quickly brought the groaning Origami out the shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while passed, Origami finally calmed down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Itsuka-kun………just what happened to me I wonder"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-well don't worry too much about it. It's my fault for bringing you to such a place. -----oh yeah, let's go check out some clothes" Origami nodded when Shidou said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">They then once again walked side by side on the road.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou scratched his cheeks at that moment. It was good to tell her to look for clothes but, he did not know what kind of shop Origami uses. If he was correct he heard that Origami in the previous world would almost always purchase her personal clothes through airmail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, what kind of shop does Origami usually buy from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuun………….I buy them near my house most of the time"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she made a wry smile and looked slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I wanted to make it more elaborate but……..I am just bad with that kind of stuff. I don't have sense for them"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. Your clothes for today are really cute you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Origami looked surprised and quickly looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-un………..nothing. M-more importantly, if you want to look for clothes, can we go to the building at the station, even though we might have to back track a bit? I rarely go there"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, of course"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou agreed at Origami's words. They then passed the back street and walked towards the main street leading to the station.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun…………I was worried there for a moment but things don't look so bad"</p>
<p class="null-p">Half-way through, Kotori's voice echoed in his right ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her affection level is increasing. If things go well, then we might be able to settle this within today.----but, don't lower your guard. I don't know the reason but, her sudden emotion value changes are extreme. Please be aware to not startle her too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood……."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that softly, Shidou walked forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not long later, both of them reached the twin-building soaring in front the station. The building was crowded with shoppers; maybe because it was a rest day.</p>
<p class="null-p">After reaching the 3rd floor with the escalator, Shidou and Origami entered a stylish selection shop that they found before looking around at the clothes lined up in there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on Shidou, don't just look"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said that in an irritated manner. After Shidou [Ah] moved his eyebrows, he called out to Origami, who was touching the fur of a coat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since we are here, I'll give you one piece as a present. What do you want?" "Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'll feel bad…….see, it's quite expensive"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami showed the coat's price tag to Shidou while whispering. 39800 yen………..it's quite a critical price for a high school male student.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, <Ratatoskr>was backing Shidou up now. Shidou *Don* hit his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave it to me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Show me the first time you wear that as payment. So have that as your thanks"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami made a wry smile in embarrassment at Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-kun, you often make girls cry?[11C 1]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh? Wh-why……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just wondering that, you seem quite used to this"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Origami looked at Shidou with half her eyes opened. Sweat flow down Shidou's cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-oi oi…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami then relaxed her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, it's a joke.----then, I'll take you for your word. But since I am at it, can you let me look around a little more? Since showing you first is the condition, I want to choice one that would make Itsuka-kun happy"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that jokingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou nodded, Origami started looking around the shop with light footsteps.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Upupu……….make girls cry. You got seen through, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give me a break…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">He mixed in a sigh in his reply when he heard Kotori's voice in his right ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't say you can't be that. Of course, Shidou being too used on handling girls is something to think about but, it's alright since its Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….what do you mean by that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your inerasable cherry boy smell"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, please don't say it"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou covered his face with both his hands and looked like he was about to cry sorrowfully. Kotori *Haaa* sigh could be heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly, don't leave Origami alone"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……….that's right"</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked around when he was told that. But, just where did she go? Origami could not be seen anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-re…….where did she go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"See, what did I tell you…………Reine, where is her location?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….hnn, approximately 20 meters behind Shin"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine talked to respond to Kotori's words. As <Ratatoskr>'s analyst, she's also providing support to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry and thanks"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Shidou listened to Reine's words. He then started walking at the back direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then found out that his goal was a dressing room separated by a curtain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I see. So that's what's going on"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou nodded in agreement. No wonder Origami couldn't be found anywhere. It seems that she already picked her clothes and has gone to try it on.</p>
<p class="null-p">While looking at the products in display on the shelf nearby, he randomly spent some time until Origami comes out.</p>
<p class="null-p">But------</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's shout suddenly echoed out from the dressing room, and caused Shidou to gasp.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what's wrong Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-why am I in…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou shouted, Origami's frightened voice could be heard from the opposite side of the curtain.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had a bad premonition. Shidou made up his mind and placed his hands on the curtain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry Origami! I am opening this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh………….? Ah, no, don't do it, Itsuka-k------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami tried to stop him but, he still ended up opening the curtain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But. Shidou opened his mouth blankly with his eyes opened when he saw her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was only natural. That's because, Origami, who collapsed down powerlessly in the dressing room was right now wearing a school swimsuit, incidentally; she was also wearing accessories like dog ear headband on her head, a dog tail on her butt, and a leather collar around her neck. Anyone will probably go blank for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-origami………….? That appearance……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She twitched her shoulders when Shidou said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-don't misunderstand! I won't-----won't………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's eyes were swimming around in chaos. It's as if Origami does not know why she was in this outfit herself too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't remember taking these clothes and yet when did i…………! Why am I in a school swimsuit-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Origami frowned her face because of a sudden headache.</p>
<p class="null-p">"School swimsuit………dog ears……uu, my head…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Origami said that painfully while pressing her head, *Piii**Piii* the alarm could be heard in the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou! Origami's emotions value!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Origami! Come, let's get you changed and see something else! Okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou turned flustered and shouted before closing the dressing room curtain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….I am so sorry. You went through all that to invite me too. I am kind of weird today………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Approximately 20 minutes after they left the shop. Origami pressed her forehead with her hands while saying that at a restaurant located at the upper level of the same building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry about it. It was me that invited you anyway. If you are feeling sick then let's end it early?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said that as if he was worried about Origami. However, Origami swung her head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-un, that's not it. It's just-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Nothing. Anyways; I am okay. Sorry for making you worry"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami tried to play it off before making a wry smile. Shidou was still looking at her worried but, he did not pry further anymore maybe to respect Origami's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami made sure Shidou did not notice before making a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like; walking with Shidou in the city was boring. Forget that, being this uplifted feel so nostalgic that it made this so unbearably fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so; sometimes…………a strange feeling would attack her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She does not know of the reason too but, the moment she saw that strange costume that would make anyone think [Just what timing would it be for me to wear something like this] in the cosplay shop, a strong wave pushed the back from the inside of her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's as if-------this was something she wore before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there was no way she did that before. A weird appearance of school swimsuit + dog ears and tail+ collar was something Origami has never worn in her life. Even if a gun was pointed at her and was told [Wear this or I will shoot], that obscene outfit was enough to make her hesitate even so. No one would be fond of wearing that unless the a few screws were loose in their head.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that was not all. This happened too when she was brought to the weird medicine shop by Shidou. At that time, Origami half-consciously grabbed a shopping basket and started shobing the bottles lined up at the shelves in a fluent manner. She was so good at it that she even wondered that there might be a point card for that shop in her purse for a moment there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I………..been to that shop before..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied when Origami mumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to match up with his actions, the food they ordered just now was served to them. Origami looked over there as if to play off the words she just said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh here, Itsuka-kun. Eat it before it gets cold okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn? Y-yeah"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if he was urged by Origami, Shidou took the spoon and started eating his omelet rice. Origami also started eating her seafood doria.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, after some time pass, right when he was half way done with his omelet rice, Shidou suddenly pressed his right ears and stood up from his seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. I'll be back soon"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, un"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what happened? Although, prying in won't do anything for her. Origami made a small nod before seeing Shidou off.</p>
<p class="null-p">She let out a big sigh when Shidou could no longer be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa………..what is wrong with me"</p>
<p class="null-p">She's going to feel bad for Shidou at this rate, even though he went through all that trouble to invite her. She has to get a grip of herself. After Origami put down her spoon, she lightly stretched her cheeks to energize herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah------"</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain object was caught in Origami's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she just made a resolve, a distorting feeling attacked her heart again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The object Origami saw. That's----- "I-Itsuka-kun's………….spoon……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Leaving his seat during meal time would mean that he left the spoon that was just in use.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt her heart pumping with tremendous momentum.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-nonono, what am I thinking…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She quickly stopped her hand that was extending towards the spoon with her other hand. That's just going overboard. She would be a perfect pervert if she does something like that. This will cause a case in court.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, even though she was well-aware of that, her right hand extended forward energetically. It's as if there was another inside Origami and was forcefully moving her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh……….calm down my right hand"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she said that, there was no effect.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her head turned chaotic within time and she no longer understood what was going on anymore. What was correct? What was wrong? The foundations of right and wrong changes according to the age and is there anyone that can saw that Origami's action will be wrong? No, there isn't (Rhetorical question). Why is this a mistake? The philosopher Oririn Toviichi once said this. No one can prove my existence but, I can make certain of my existence by licking Shidou's spoon. Which means, My licking proves that I am here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside Origami's hazy consciousness, she felt her left hand stopping her right hand, turning weaker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ou, Sorry Origami, I made you wait------"</p>
<p class="null-p">And. Shidou, who got back from the toilet, stopped his legs right in front the table.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_15.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Shidou has encountered the scene of Origami holding his spoon and extending her tongue out to it with a very lewd expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Origami………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Origami twitched her shoulders as if she just noticed Shidou's existence. Light filled her eyes when it was empty like she was possessed by something and sweat started pouring out of her face immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-don't be mistaken! This is……not what you think it is!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He doesn't know what he was mistaken about but, Origami raised her voice in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no, it's okay…….i am used to it too anyway"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen! It's really not what you think! Y-yes, it's just t-that! Your spoon dropped onto the floor when you stood up from your seat! And it was just so happen that I picked it up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami begged Shidou by shouting and *Gatan* stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">The cup left on the table shook from the impact when she stood up and dropped towards Shidou's direction. Water splashed onto the hem of the shirt Shidou was wearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oopps……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! I-I am so sorry, I panicked and-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, this is enough so it's okay. It will dry fast anyway"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that to calm Origami, who looked ashamed, Shidou pinched the hem of his shirt and lightly squeeze it to remove the water. Shidou's belly button peeked out when he did that.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami took out her cell phone from her pocket with lightning speed and the sound of continuous shutter pressing echoed after the lens was pointed to Shidou with fluid movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou opened his eyes in surprise, Origami was also making a shocked expression at the opposite side too. It's as if her body disobeying her will and moved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Believe me, Itsuka-kun……….! M-my body…….is moving by its own…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami appealed to him with teary eyes. However, her finger was still continuously pressing on the shutter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Why!? Whyyyyyyy!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's teary voice and continuous shutter pressing, echoed throughout the afternoon restaurant.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 10: The Angel Of The Night With Falling Stars</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">The time was 6:30 Pm. The sun will set faster during November. The city sunk into darkness already.</p>
<p class="null-p">The atmosphere was cold as if the warmth during the day was a lie, and If he *haaa* exhale, a white mist will form and disappear. The pleasant breeze shook the trees and the falling leaves flew up to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within the sounds of winter's footsteps, Shidou and Origami visited the high ground park which has a clear view of the city. <Ratatoskr>ordered him to go there since it was a place filled with the mood to end a date.</p>
<p class="null-p">Many stars could be seen at the outer edge of the park.-----Well, the electronic lights sparkling on the ground were more amusing since they were more in number than the ones in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a little cold at this time as expected"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Origami, who was looking at the night scenery, tilted her head slightly forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unn, I was unprepared since it was warm during the day. I should have brought my gloves"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that before making a wry smile while rubbing her hands together.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was on a rampage during the afternoon but, she has finally calmed down………….Well, she would sometimes point her cell phone lens at Shidou, smell Shidou's neck smell, and even though she was not holding anything, she would take on a posture as if she was pouring into the cup Shidou was drinking but……………Shidou did not worry too much about it. From what he heard from her, it seems that her body moves by reflex. As expected,"Origami is really Origami huh"; Shidou felt that he was a little relieved knowing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……….That's true. Ah, oh yeah. We can use a can coffee from that vending machine----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's voice echoed in his right ear just when Shidou was about to finish his sentence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------hey, that's a wrong choice, Shidou. A girl is saying that her hands are cold you know"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking around silently for a moment, Shidou nodded to make his resolve and placed his hands over Origami's hands.------either it was from the nervousness or cold; Shidou's hands were slightly trembling though.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami widens her eyes in surprise for an instant. But, she immediately realized Shidou's intentions. Her cheeks slightly blushed and slightly looked downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"FuFuun, why not. Her affection level isn't bad. We might be able to end this today.-----but, I guess we need one more push to fully seal her"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said that with a groan. Reine's reply then echoed in the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………aah, one more thing, there is something inside her pulling her back. This reading……. It's close to anxiety. I guess it's about her not knowing about Shin's acceptance to her"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anxiety………huh. Well, it's right after causing all those eccentric actions after all………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori made a dry smile and said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that just makes things simpler. All we have to do is make her anxiety disappear right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..well that's right but…………. What are we going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori snorted when Shidou asked with a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it obvious? Origami is feeling anxious because she doesn't know if Shidou accepts her right? Then, it's the best and fastest way to tell her through words"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which means…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The confession of love is the only choice"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could somewhat predict that. A stream of sweat droops down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">He recalled back the time he confessed to Origami in the previous world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back, that was also ordered by Kotori with the goal of training him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thinks about it that was the reason why the Origami of the previous world started getting very assertive to Shidou. Is this Origami the same as her?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's suddenly echoed when Shidou was wondering that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you hesitating? This is the best chance to seal the Spirit hunter <Devil>? If we miss today's chance; there might be the possibility that the other Spirits might meet danger the next time the next chance comes"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whispering of love even though Shidou has not made up his mind was just plain dishonest. But, there might be casualties if he doesn't seal Origami here. They might be the girls that have already been sealed, and it might even be Spirits he hasn't met before. Or maybe-----there's the possibility that Origami might hurt herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's something Shidou must not allow.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou *Suuu* exhaled, he looked towards Origami while still holding onto her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heey-----Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes? Itsuka-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err………. There is something I want to tell you"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Origami looked back at Shidou's face with a meek face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he and Origami were looking at each other, he found out that his heart suddenly started pumping harder.</p>
<p class="null-p">He reconfirmed her loveliness once again when she looked at her face again. Hair bangs covering her forehead. Transparent clear eyes paired with long eyelashes. Cherry lips that might steal his heart just by even touching it------ the thought of how lucky he was at the previous world for being loved by a girl like this grazed his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he can't stay engrossed in such emotions. After Shidou gulped, he set aside the anxiety inside her heart and was about to open his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, right before Shidou was about to say that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I……have something I have to tell Itsuka-kun too"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami quietly said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-is it something you have to say…….?</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied back because the timing for confession got slipped out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami then looked away hesitantly for a few moments before slowly moving her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know that I was a part of the JGDSF Anti Spirit team----the AST right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…….I know"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I quit AST just recently"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou spoke ambiguously. He has already heard from Kotori that Origami has resigned from the AST but, it's just unnatural for Shidou to know that here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so………..is it because that your consciousness gets cut off from Anemia, like what happened last time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Origami *Fuu* looked downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un. That is one of the reasons. That's because that sickness is critical in a job that uses dangerous weapon. But------ever since I get that sickness. I, no longer understand something"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No longer understand? What………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Origami made an awkward wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..even the AST's job is to defeat the Spirits, which is the cause of the</p>
<p class="null-p">Space quake……..i was just wondering, if that really is the right thing to do" "Wha-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's normal. Speaking of the Origami, Shidou knows about; she hates spirits, and lived with the goal of killing Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, maybe because the influence of her parents not killed by the Spirits was big or maybe, she started feeling that because she became a Spirit, even though it's unconsciously--------he doesn't know about the details but; he never thought he would hear those words from her, even in his dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, just what did she take on Shidou's reaction; Origami brought her eyebrows closer apologetically.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………I am sorry. The Spirit's were the ones that killed Itsuka-kun's brother" "Do-don't apologize!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami made a surprised look at Shidou's words. His brother-------it was actually Shidou-----was killed but, she probably didn't thought he would say something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that Origami's way of thinking is wrong at all, not even a little. I---not that; my brother must have thought that way too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-kun……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that with a trembling voice; her shoulders trembled slightly and she looks as if she was about to cry anytime soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, So-sorry……what have I"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she looked away to play it off. Shidou did not pry into the matter anymore and poured strength into his hands which were Origami's hands harder.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A fanfare could be heard suddenly in the Incam in his right ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---Affection level, sudden burst up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Point, it has reached the top!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Fumu, looks like that was the reason for her remaining anxiety"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine's voice could be heard afterwards. No wonder; Origami was worried about Shidou's thoughts regarding Origami different emotions towards the Spirits which were sprouting inside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright………..! Shidou, this feels good! Finish it in one go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori gave the Go sign………….this somehow messed up the mood. Shidou made a wry smile while holding Origami's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, this was a great chance. Shidou arranged his breathing to calm his heartbeat which increased from the nervousness before quietly looking back at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, err-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Itsuka-kun, look at that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou's confession was interrupted once again. Origami hang out to the wooden guardrails installed at the edge of the park and pointed her finger up to the sky. At the direction she was pointing to, a glittering star was falling down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a shooting star, a shooting star. I have to make a wish"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? E-even if you tell me that all of a sudden----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he says that, Shidou started making a wish in his head.-----he wished that he could seal Origami's Reiryoku properly. And also, Origami and the girls to understand each other……well, the shooting star was long gone by the time he reached that point but-------</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..uh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Origami, who hang out at the guard rail to look up at the sky, suddenly gasped; she suddenly pulled his hands which was holding onto hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's warning shook his right ear's eardrum.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not know what happened there for a moment. But-----he immediately understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because the guardrail was too old; the part that was getting stressed by Origami's body weight, *Meri* bent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Origami's body who was hanging on it fell off the park's outer edge which was by the way located at a high location, as if to match up to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami shouted loudly. Shidou shouted and at the same time he was surprised from her voice and the event that just happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, luckily or not; Shidou was still holding onto Origami's hands. His arm's tendons were about to be torn off when it was pulled from the sudden weight but, he somehow managed to pour strength into it and hang onto Origami. When he did that, his left hand felt a sharp pain maybe because he scratched the cross section of the broken guardrail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Toaryaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with an odd shout, he fell backwards together with Origami. Origami then [Kyaa] let out a short shout before covering Shidou, who fell upwards by riding on top of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch….A-are you alright, Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-un……….thank you, Itsuka-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami replied back with a trembling voice at Shidou's words. She was probably quite shocked; he could feel her heartbeat pumping violently through her chest which was pushed onto him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou then noticed something.</p>
<p class="null-p">He found out that he was so close to Origami that he could feel her breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----it's a chance, Shidou! The affection level is enough. Finish it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's voice echoed. It's true that, Origami's head position could be reached if Shidou slightly raises his head. Judging by the situation where they just escaped danger; this was the best chance there is.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami………."</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, felt something was off when he was about to kiss Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was not looking at Shidou but more below…………..it was directed towards Shidou's left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou followed her and looked to his left hand before gasping.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a painful wound on Shidou's left hand when he pulled Origami up but………..flames of Reirokyu were flickering on his wounds as if it was healing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instantly----an ear-piercing loud siren echoed in his right ear's Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!! Shidou! Run!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Kotori's shout shook Shidou's eardrums, Origami, who was covering Shidou slowly rose up as if she was being pulled by strings from the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she stood up, the impression of her soulless eyes looked different from the ones she showed just now and mumbled something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---------Spirit…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the same scene he saw when they were on the school roof a few days ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">---that time Origami saw the Spirit-Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">The [Speculation] Reine said, grazed his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever Origami sees a Spirit; she will regain her memories of the previous world----and turn into the Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, the flames licking Shidou's arm, belongs none other to the Spirit <Efreet>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-a-Aaaah-ah-Ahh………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked up at the skies with her soulless eyes while her body twitches with intervals in between. Saliva flow down from the edge of her lips and it shows that something unusual was happening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Origami, wait--------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tried calling Origami even though he was flustered. But, right before he was able to finish his sentence, the strong Reiryoku veil surrounding Origami easily blew Shidou behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though his back and his face fell flat onto the ground, he somehow managed to kill the momentum and lift his face in a crawling manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">With Origami in the center, black spider nest spread out from her and wrapped around her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">A black Astral dress like a mourning dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">That appearance-----was genuine.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was her Inverse form that trampled over his previous world.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">In a room of the Spirit mansion; Tohka was hugging a big cushion while rolling on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka wasn't the only one in the room. When she took a glance over to the television, she could see the Yamai sisters competing in a game with ice cream as the prize and when she looked behind, she could see Yoshino and Natsumi chatting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The Itsuka family house was empty since Shidou and Kotori has a big matter to attend today so, all of them gathered in Tohka's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nuu………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After giving out a groan for who knows how many times; Tohka switched her sleeping side on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like she was unsatisfied for staying at home. This happened many times already in the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that she feels a little lonely because she can't eat Shidou's food but, since Shidou and Kotori were busy; Tohka just can't trouble them because of her selfishness.</p>
<p class="null-p">However…………..just what's going on? Her heart has been on a rampage today for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it didn't start today more specifically. A few days ago------ever since the transfer student came to the class, Tohka has been feeling something fuzzy around her chest and couldn't do anything about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Tohka was shaking her throat difficulty, *Nyuuu* Miku's head popped up behind the Sofa's backrest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, what is wrong Tohka-san. Feeling cranky that darling isn't here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. It's just that…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka made a sullen face, she immersed herself in thought to find the words that fits her current feelings. But, she could not express anything at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….muu"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Aahnn] Miku relaxed her face while it turned red before she jumped over the sofa as if she was a running high jump player jumping over a bar; she then dove in between the gaps behind Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnnnmoou! Tohka-san's troubled face is too much! *Cohoo*! *Cohoo*!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wriggled her body while saying that. Incidentally, the mysterious voice at the last half of the sentence was the sound of her rough breathing when she was pushing her face onto Tohka's back.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_16.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing, Miku, its ticklish!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muuun, why not? It's not something that will decrease anyway"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku wrapped her hands around Tohka and passionately rubbed her cheeks on her. After Tohka placed her hands on Miku's forehead, she then pushed Miku to pull herself away from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">---at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka raised her eyebrows in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">She does not know the exact reason why. But------her body felt something. It felt like fireworks sparking inside her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shock. That was-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that Tohka wasn't the only one who felt that. The Yamai sisters, who were competing, also raised their face at the same time. The moment they did that, image of the car crashed was shown on the television screen maybe because they made a mistake in the controls.</p>
<p class="null-p">Further behind her; Yoshino and Natsumi brought their eyebrows closer and looked around; Miku clinging onto Tohka also looked surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what is it………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------------"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka felt danger with her instincts, she jumped off the sofa and opened the window before heading out the veranda barefooted.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then hung out at the guardrails and looked left and right before, she saw a dim light released around a cliff far away in the night skies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A normal person would not stop to bother that level of brightness. However, Tohka the Spirit noticed it in one glance. That glow was from Reiryoku. -----there is someone with tremendous power at that place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun, something feels fishy. This feeling is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. A----Spirit"</p>
<p class="null-p">The others followed Tohka out the veranda. They then looked towards the direction that Tohka felt the Reiryoku coming from, as if they were prearranged to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err……that place is"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, I think the park is around the area?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Miku said that; Shidou, who was not here appeared inside Tohka's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Now that she mentions it, Shidou brought Tohka to that place before last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she recognized that, Tohka's heart rang like an alarm bell.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like she was curtained that Shidou was at that spot. But, the face of Shidou floating in her mind, mixed in with the odd feeling that has been lurking in her heart until now and caused Tohka's heartbeat to rise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Within her half-conscious state, Tohka placed her legs on the veranda guardrail before jumping into the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reiryoku value, category E! Tobiichi Origami has inversed!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh----Like I thought, Reine's speculations were correct huh……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori ,her crews voice and the continuous sound of the alarm which call forth danger instinctively, could be heard from the Incam in his right ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou heard those sounds while quietly looking at Origami alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Shidou was in chaos. Origami inversed again when she could finally be saved and he was scared to his wits.</p>
<p class="null-p">However within those emotions, an extremely calm situation judgment was formulating somewhere in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou dashed towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he was blown away by the wall of swirling Reiryoku surrounding Origami, right before he could reach her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou!? what are you doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to stop Origami……..now, or else something terrible will happen!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Origami's inverse was because she saw the healing flames which activated unconsciously; if that is the case then, her inverse will not settle down unless her target Shidou disappears in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, naturally; Shidou can't make a clone of himself like Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which means-----Origami will continue rampaging until Shidou is dead and once that condition is fulfilled and Origami's inverse settles down; the method to seal Origami's Reiryoku will forever be lost in replacement for that condition fulfillment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course; Shidou has Kotori's protection- the power of healing flames. It would immediately heal all half-baked wounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there's a limit to that. It's true that Shidou replaced Origami's parents with himself 5 years ago but, it was still unknown that he survived because of Kotori's healing Reiryoku or [Yud Bet]'s power was depleted right before he received the attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if the healing power was possible; there's a possibility that Origami will continue staying inversed as long as she knows that Shidou's alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then----the chance is only now.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the only chance to get close to Origami since she has not manifested her [Wing].</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While calling out her name-----Shidou recalled back the scene he once saw.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scene that the city was messed up from the rays of darkness shot down from the Inversed Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">He can't have that happen ever again. He can't let Origami do that ever again.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou clenched his fist, he once again dashed towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop, Shidou! Hurry up and get away from Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, at that moment, Kotori's shout shook his eardrums and Shidou stopped his legs in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what are you saying! This is the only chance-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said; get away from her. Don't tell me you're trying to breakthrough a Reiryoku wall with your body?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widens his eyes in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Kotori's voice echoed in his right ear; several glows appeared around Origami and within them, sharp metallic clusters appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">It has a form that looks like a metallic diamond with stretched sides. Putting it into words; it looks like a giant [leaf]. All of it deployed invisible walls and were surrounding Origami with its tip pointed at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"------<Yggd Folium>, deploy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Kotori said that, the [Leaf] increased the size of the invisible wall set up and restrained Origami by crushing her, who was wearing a black Astral dress, from 8 different sides.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Yggd Folium>. They are <Fraxinus>all-purpose automated units with Territory in each of them. Sorry but, we set them up around you. I didn't thought we would be using them though"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Fuun*Kotori snorted before saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards, the moment Shidou thought a glow appeared far up above the park that he and Origami was in, the airship <Fraxinus>appeared as if its mirror skin got torn off. Before he knew it, it seems that it has reached to a location that could be seen by the naked eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, <Fraxinus>would deploy its invisible camouflage with its Realizer and hide its existence from the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only time the ship would expose itself was when it needs to release the Realizer's output outside the Territory deployed around its surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">More specifically; it was to retrieve personals or objects outside with the teleporter, or to dispatch the <Yggd Folium>outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also----when it's about to fire <Mystletainn>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori, don't tell me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou shouted, <Fraxinus>slowly lowered its bow downwards at the sky as to respond and pointed its cannon at Origami. This action cannot be performed unless the airship was controlled with a Territory because it was a really unstable position.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maryoku light glowed inside the cannon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Relax. We adjusted the power. <Mystletainn>will break the Reiryoku wall for a few seconds so, take that chance and get close to Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………! O-okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"------I didn't want to be rough but, we can't have the city to be destroyed"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Commander, Maryoku charge complete, we can shoot anytime!" The voices of the crew echoed in response to Kotori's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright. Target, Tobiichi Origami on the ground! Don't miss this, Kannazuki!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave it to me"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Fraxinus>vice Commander-Kannazuki Kyouhei shook his right eardrum with a calm voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Mystletainn>fi--------------"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it occurred right before Kotori was about to give out her order. Shidou gasped in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori! Ruuuuuuun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He then shouted so hard that he might break his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. Up at Shidou's view-------several [Wing] giving out a black glow surrounded <Fraxinus>which was floating up at the dark sky, it's just like how they surrounded Origami with the <Yggd Folium>------<Satan>has appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh-----?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the danger alarm and Kotori's unguarded voice could be heard through the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">After <Satan>pointed its tip at <Fraxinus>, it shot highly-dense black beams that look like concentrated darkness, all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Fraxinus>'s white frame was covered with darkness from all direction; there were explosions, there were scraping and some pierced through. Loud explosions and their screams echoed into his right ear's Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori! Kotori……!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no answer even though Shidou shouted. Instead; smoke puffed out from every places of the <Fraxinus>floating up in the sky and at the same time, the <Yggd Folium>restraining Origami, flickered weakly before falling around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widen his eyes in horror while letting out a short voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">The <Fraxinus>falling down from the night sky. That scene resembles the one he saw in the previous world.</p>
<p class="null-p">The <Fraxinus>got shot down by Origami at that time too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why……just why…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted half-consciously.</p>
<p class="null-p">The history that was supposed to be changed, the world that should have been rewritten, all of it were flowing back to its original form, one event after another. ------it's as if, this was forcing Shidou to know that no matter how much he struggles, the ending that has been decided cannot be changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having her shackles released, Origami floated up from the spot without saying anything and bend her body to look like an embryo.-----it's like she was trapping her heart from the outside world.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, the tips of the countless [wing] started brimming with darkness as if it was going to continue attacking the <Fraxinus>which was slowly lowering its altitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………! Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou called out her name, and dashed to the spot again. But------he was obstructed by the Reiryoku wall and could not touch Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">During the time he was doing this, the black [Wing] waiting in the sky, was launching its attack to <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Fraxinus>was already half-destroyed from the previous attack. He had no idea what would happen to the crew and <Fraxinus>if it receive the next attack now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop, Origami! Please Stoooooopppp!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou's call did not reach Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Black beams were released from the tips of the countless [Wing].</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he thought a sudden gust blew past; the black [Wing] got shaken and slightly diverted its direction. The beam shot by <Satan>scratched <Fraxinus>'s frame before disappearing into the empty sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how strong that wind may be; there was no way a normal wind would shake <Satan>. Shidou noticed the identity of the wind and twitched his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, when Shidou thought several [Wing] appeared around Origami, it pointed its tip at him. It seems that she judged Shidou as a potential enemy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh------!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He can't dodge this number. Shidou prepared himself for the incoming attack and stiffen up.</p>
<p class="null-p">But; faster than Origami able to fire her Angel's-[Wing] by a beat,</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Haaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When that voice echoed above from the sky; a Spirit, who manifested her limit Astral dress, swung her giant sword and blew the [Wing] away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay, Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said the girl's name. Yes. It was Tohka that was supposed to be in the mansion beside the Itsuka family house, was the one that appeared here.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, she was not the only one. Following after Tohka, the Spirits in their Limit Astral dress started appearing in the park one after another.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino sitting behind a giant rabbit puppet, an Adult Natsumi, and Miku, who manifested a light keyboard around her. And in the sky, it was the Yamai sisters that caused that typhoon just now to save <Fraxinus>from critical danger. "You girls----why are you all here!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-eer……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, it's normal that I would run over here to save darling from a pinch"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you followed after Tohka-chan afterwards anyway"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhh, you mustn't say that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku [Shhh] made one finger stand. The behavior of the adult version Natsumi changed completely as she leisurely shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-----Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka prepared the Angel <Sandalphon>as if to protect Shidou, she glared at Origami without lowering her guard and moved her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………I feel a very strong Reiryoku. Just who is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka asked him. Shidou clenched his fist enough for his fingernails to bite into his meat and answered her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……..Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…………? That is the transfer student?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka asked dubiously. However, it was only natural for her to do so. The days Tohka and Origami met in this world was little-------more importantly, it was probably hard to believe if she was told that it was her classmate that's floating up in the sky while wearing a black Astral dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">She has an overpowering majestic appearance that will make anyone freeze in fear even just by confronting her.</p>
<p class="null-p">DEM's Isaac Westcott named Inversed Spirits as Devil kings but------that right now in front of Shidou, has tremendous power that does not make that expression sound over the top.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">But. After Shidou clenched his teeth, he took one step forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka raised her eyebrows when he done that. She most likely was telling him that it's dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">He's fully aware of that. But, Shidou has to reach Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Origami is left unleased in the sky then, the Tenguu city spread out under his eyes will once again turn into the ruins that are inside Shidou's memories. And for Origami------she will probably never return to the normal self ever again.</p>
<p class="null-p">That has to be prevented no matter what.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it's a small possibility; Shidou was the only one-----that has to take Origami's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">However-----Shidou's power isn't enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's power was just too small in front of the powerful devil king in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………everyone"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou faced over to everyone who flew over her; before letting out his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">---was he going tell them to run away?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was he going to tell them to avoid fighting Origami?</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Please help me to…….save her……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he felt apologetic for doing this, he had no choice but to say this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, who was standing in front of Shidou, made a surprised face for a moment before replying back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying? Of course I will"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she gripped <Sandalphon>'s handle harder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou saved me. You thought me the beauty of this world. Shidou was the one that made my world----then it's my turn now to help Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following after Tohka, the other Spirits also nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me and Yoshinon………….want to be useful to Shidou-san….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes yes, be honest and count on Onee-san. Shidou-kun isn't very strong so you shouldn't be reckless"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, even if it's darling, I would be angry if you told us to [Run away] you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino, Natsumi and Miku *Nii* smiled while saying that. Kaguya and Yuzuru's voice echoed down from the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka, very well then! I have received your determination properly! The child of the typhoons-Kaguya will lend you her power!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Undertaking. Leave the sky to Yuzuru and Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gripped his fist when he heard everyone's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you all.-----Let's go to Origami"</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">---[Origami] was lost her composure.</p>
<p class="null-p">After getting saved by Shidou when she was about to fall off the edge of the park, her concioussness got far away like usual the moment she saw the flickering light on Shidou's arm but………..</p>
<p class="null-p">She was standing at an unknown place when she noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">As far as she could see, the empty space was completely pure white. Is that thing the sky or ceiling above her head? She doesn't even know if the view in front of her was the horizon or not. Tentatively, she was [Standing] at the spot but; the feeling of stepping on the ground feels a little fuzzy and the hallucination of her floating will attack her when she relaxes. It's as if she slipped into a Manga coma that has not been drawn yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What is this place…)</p>
<p class="null-p">She mumbled blankly while looking around.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This is a dream…..no matter how much I think)</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't take long for Origami to make her judgment. However, it was not impossible. There was no way this kind of space would exist.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-----</p>
<p class="null-p">(………Eh?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami widens her eyes unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, further up Origami's view. One girl appeared in the space which was empty just now, before she noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">A slender girl wearing a black dress that looks like darkness. She was crouched down while hugging her knees and was making a soulless look.</p>
<p class="null-p">(You are……….)</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami noticed it when she said that far.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Me----?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Because the scenery looked very impossible to happen, she did not understand for an instant but no matter how much she looks, the girl there looks similar to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">No……………..it's a little different if it was put into more correct words. Unlike Origami, whose hair was reaching half-way down her back; the hair of the girl crouching down in front of her, only reached the length until it tickles her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, in an opposite sense, that was the only difference they had other than the clothes she was wearing. Sweat flowed down Origami's cheeks in reflex when she felt weird feeling as if she was looking at a mirror.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What is this……)</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she judged that this place and feeling was just a dream, Origami could only raise her eyebrows dubiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">However at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">(-----------!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Unfamiliar scenes and words flowed into Origami's head in one go.</p>
<p class="null-p">No………more specially, it was a little different.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Origami instantly gained all that information, a conviction was born inside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This memories……are mine……?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. They were.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those few year worth of memories, were probably what Origami would experience if she walked a slightly different path from the current one.</p>
<p class="null-p">---[Origami] closed her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Information was born inside Origami, the moment she say the flames of swaying Reiryoku. They were Origami's memories of the previous world, she has forgotten.</p>
<p class="null-p">When those memories devoured her consciousness, Origami's felt her body and heart getting dyed in pure black.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, 5 years ago on that summer day; Origami's parents were the ones that were killed in front of Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-----the Spirit that killed her parents was Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she recalled that, Origami could not think anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">That might be her defensive instincts kicking in to protect herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fundamental factors that made her current self.</p>
<p class="null-p">The meaning of her life that became her goal of life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside her head which felt those thoughts returning to the void in the worst possible way; those memories separated itself from the Origami of this world as if her ego was completely destroyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was this world's rule. The Origami of this world will have her consciousness separated away the moment her Reiryoku appears and the Origami with the memories of the previous world will gain the authority to control.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami can no longer feel anything. She can't think of anything. She can't sense anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only one------Origami will only use her powers to kill the Spirit in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">A small light suddenly appeared inside Origami's head which should have disposed of everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">She does not know what happened. Even if it was recognized, the current Origami was not conscious of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">---It should have been so.</p>
<p class="null-p">However; that light expanded a certain memory inside Origami's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That's.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the memories of the Origami who has lived in the world where both of her parents did not die 5 years ago on that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">(-------ah-----------)</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami let out a very soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">The consciousness of [Origami] and [Origami] started mixing together like a whirlpool.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka! I am the child of the typhoon loved by the wind!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Respond. There is no one in this world that can follow us"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, the Yamai sisters both kicked the air at the same time and easily flew in the sky. In the next moment, beams passed by the spot that the both of them were at. It seems that <Satan>which was attacking <Fraxinus>identified them as threat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun! No matter how strong the power may be, it means nothing if it doesn't hit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya said proudly while dodging the approaching beams with a paper thin difference using acrobatic movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Advice. Now, Shidou. Go for the main body while we are attracting this attention"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru told them while dodging the beams like Kaguya. Shidou nodded before looking back at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am counting on you all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits replied back all at once when Shidou said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However at the same time, Origami, who was released by the binds of the <Yggd Folium>slowly ascended up to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">He can't let Origami get away. Shidou shook his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay Okaaay, leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku then slid her fingers on the light keyboard that she deployed around her, and started playing an elegant song.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Gabriel>------[Rondo]!"</p>
<p class="null-p">To match with her actions, several pipes appeared around Origami and pointed its tips at Origami. Miku's song turned into an invisible power and after making several layers; Origami who was ascending to the sky, got pushed down to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, not bad Miku-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi made a bewitching smile from watching her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, if Miku-chan gets pressured by that girl; she won't be able to do her original job. Then-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi raised her right hand and manifested a broom Angel. She then------</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Haniel>-----[Kaleidoscope]"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Natsumi said that name, the broom in her hand bent like soft clay and formed the shape of pipes and a keyboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? That's……………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku, who was playing her keyboard, looked shocked. It was natural for her to be like that. That's because the Angel Natsumi manifested looked exactly like Miku's <Gabriel>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be borrowing this, Miku-chan. Actually; I wanted to [Act] this once, ever since I saw this last time"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Natsumi crossed both her hands and after playing the keyboard powerfully; she started playing a valorous song.</p>
<p class="null-p">"[March]!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The group was brimming with energy the moment they heard the song. Although the power was slightly lower, it's definitely Miku's [March].</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhhhn! Natsumi-chan you copycat!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, why not. This is for Shidou-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Buuuu. I'll have you pay for copyright infringement later. I'll have you know that an Idol's privileges are really strict"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku *Pukuuu* puffed her cheeks. It looks like she is a little frustrated that her exclusive Angel has been manifested. Nonetheless, <Gabriel>'s existence was very important for the group in a battle. Tohka and Yoshino tilted forward as if they were going to head to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, several more [Wing] appeared from Origami when the space around her started to distort as if to counter them.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of it flew around in random trajectories and shot beams at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tooouuuu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino and the Angel-<Zadkiel>who was [Yoshinon] transformed; let out her voice and went forward to protect Shidou. Instantly, the water particles in the air condensed and froze to divert the trajectory of Origami's beam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Yoshino, Yoshinon! That was a great help!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No……..more importantly, please be careful, more is coming!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino looked at the [Wing] flying in the sky without lowering her guard and said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino's right. There were still countless small [Wing] floating around Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not only did they not manifest their perfect Astral Dress, the Spirits will receive critical wounds if they are hit in their current Limit Astral Dress. The Yamai sisters and Yoshino were dodging the attacking skillfully but he doesn't think that it will last long. He has to reach Origami as fast as possible------</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Shidou was immersed in thought, the [Wing] all pointed its tips to Shidou's direction as if they sensed him doing so.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A flash appeared in Shidou's view together with a loud shout and all the [Wing] got blown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted. Yes. Tohka used <Sandalphon>and attacked the [Wing] before they fired.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the power from a limit form <Sandalphon>will not suffice to destroy the [Wing]. The undamaged [Wing] started concentrating darkness on its tips again with a behavior as if it has its own will.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Yoshino, I leave Shidou to you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yes………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino answered to Tohka who said that while facing her back to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san, let's go! Please come behind me.</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Yoshino covered <Zadkiel>'s back with cold air as if to make armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like controlling a marionette, Yoshino pulled both her hands and made</p>
<p class="null-p"><Zadkiel>move forward. Shidou hid behind the shadows of the giant rabbit and advanced towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, without even giving a few seconds; <Zadkiel>march was stopped. -----when he looked over there, he saw new [Wing] manifested around Origami and a strong Reiryoku shield was made around them as the core. All they have to do was to dodge the [Wing] trajectories if it attacks them. However, they had no choice but to force through if they were devoted into defense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu…………uuuu-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uguuoooooo! This sure is tough!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino, Yoshinon! Are you two alright!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am………okay……….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino replied back painfully. She doesn't sound okay no matter how much he hears her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, after Yoshino sharpened her sights, she clenched both her fist and bent <Zadkiel>'s body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am…….weak and a crybaby but………I will send Shidou-san to that person"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Zadkiel>'s body glowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------The power to break the wall"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino spread out her hands. The control strings from <Zadkiel>'s back extended out to her 5 fingers and were sparkling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Zadkiel>-----[Siryon]……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she called that name; <Zadkiel>'s big body distorted and was absorbed through the control strings connected to Yoshino's fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">The dense light stored in the strings coiled around Yoshino's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a shrill voice in reflex at the scene he has not seen before.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in reply to him,</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Yes, Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Yoshino's firm voice filled with clear intentions.</p>
<p class="null-p">The light settled down and she finally can be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Armor………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He mumbled blankly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Yoshino was there wearing a white armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">No------if a more specific word was insisted, it was a question on whether or not to call that an armor. The weird material that cannot be taken as metal or resins has joined together with clear ice to cover Yoshino's Astral dress; it's as if she was wearing <Zadkiel>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yoshino was fully covered with cold air, she thrust both her hands forward and joined her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">A blizzard tornado covered her arms covered with the white armor and formed a gigantic cone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino twisted her joined arms with all her might. Instantly, the drill of cold air swirling around Yoshino's arms, opened a gap between the [Wing] and [Wing] like a drill.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san……..now……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A------aah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou replied to Yoshino, he slipped through the path Yoshino opened and ran towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who was pushed down by Miku's [Rondo] was still stopped above 1 meter off the ground. Of course, if the Inversed Origami uses her power, she can easily get rid of Miku's sound since she can only use her Limited powers------not even a little of will and energy can be felt from Origami now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since her attacks uses the black [Wing] too, Origami does not need to let her voice. It's as if it was going around exterminating enemy against her will, like a body's immunity system.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his voice and called Origami's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami did not even show a little respond as expected. Her eyes filled with despair only looked soulless and was directed up to the empty sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou recalled back the scene from the previous world and clenched his teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time. Just like what happened here, Shidou managed to reach to Origami thanks to everyone's hard work. However, Origami's heart was completely closed and would not respond to any words Shidou says.</p>
<p class="null-p">Things will end up like last time, if this goes on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's power wasn't enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something--------he needs something that he didn't have at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted. He extended his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, what's next------he needs an impact inside Origami to make her take Shidou's hand.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 6</p>
<p class="null-p">2 memories mixed inside Origami minds.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's another self inside her, it feels as if she was looking from both sides at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">That should be so. The Origami from the previous world and the Origami of this world was still Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">By having 2 memories at the same time, Origami understood everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">The weird feeling that occurred during today's date with Shidou. The feeling when her body moved with another wills that does not belong to her. It occurred because Origami's body and subconscious was reacting to Shidou's existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">This situation is the same too. Originally, the Origami of this world was right [Now]------should not be awake when she was in a condition where Spirit powers was active.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, thanks to the influence from Shidou's existence, the boundary of the memories of this world and the previous world turned fuzzy----and in conclusion, the Irregularity of Origami coming in contact with the 2 memories has occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that caused Origami to be in a terrible chaotic state. With her hearts closed, the Origami that was trying to throw everything away and the Origami that was trying to stop her, were inside one container entangled complexly.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I killed my father, and mother, 5 years ago------)</p>
<p class="null-p">(----that event did not happen in this world! Itsuka-kun's brother saved father and mother 5 years ago………..!)</p>
<p class="null-p">The image of the young man who saved them from the beam floated up the same time Origami said that. Aah, now that she thinks about it; that wasn't Shidou's brother but rather it was Shidou himself. She was able to confirm that because she currently possesses the memories of the previous world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next off, the gentle 1 year she passed with her parents after the fire, started spreading in her brain. Her smiling father and mother. Those warm gatherings. That irreplaceable time that those 3 spent together.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she had those memories. If these scenes were left in her mind. Then, Origami would probably live a different life.</p>
<p class="null-p">---however</p>
<p class="null-p">(Then……what is this? Just what is the memories inside me………!?)</p>
<p class="null-p">The surrounding scene was in flames. The scene of the city covered in flickering flames popped up. A crater carved in the road. Human parts scattered around. Burnt blood that did not have time to even flow. A young Origami looking up the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was exactly the experience Origami went through 5 years ago in the previous world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt a series urge to vomit and drowsiness at that hellish memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Uu-ah………..ah…….)</p>
<p class="null-p">A vivid sense of reality. Of course it's real. That's because the person that experience that was none other than Origami herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I-----can't go on anymore. I…..no longer……)</p>
<p class="null-p">(That's…….not……..)</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was about to be crushed by the mixed emotions of sadness, anger and deep hatred; Origami tried calling out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, another memory floated up to interrupt her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The events of the previous world, which was unknown to her. The inversed view. The darkness expanding in the sky. The destroyed city. She was about to scream from those gruesome scenes.</p>
<p class="null-p">That did not happen in this world. But that scene was definitely caused by Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt her view distorting. It became hard to maintain her consciousness from that hallucination as if her whole existence was being tainted with black.</p>
<p class="null-p">---but, it was no use. If Origami loses consciousness here then, there will be no one else to stop Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">She won't tell her to stop worrying about it just because the event from 5 years ago has been made to [Never happened].</p>
<p class="null-p">She won't tell her to forget about it just because that the grand disaster that occurred in the previous world did not happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if Origami gives up everything here then, this world that has nothing occurred in it will turn out like the Origami's previous world.</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have destroyed several cities. Many people probably died too.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that really happened then, Origami will never return back to normal. That has to be stopped no matter what.</p>
<p class="null-p">But,</p>
<p class="null-p">(uu………A-aah--------)</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami finally fell to her knees from the torrents of heavy emotions pouring into her, one after another.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami probably knows this too. The mistake that Origami committed does not exist in this world. And the fact that she can change things in this world too.</p>
<p class="null-p">that's because just like how the memories of the previous world was shared with her, Origami also has the memories of this world too.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even though she recognizes that, the emotion that, there was no way that she could live in this world was rampaging inside Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">(St……..Stop me-----A-aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh…………!!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Origami's voice was not enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Origami of this world can't save the Origami of the previous world alone. The most she could do was share the memories of this world to open Origami's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes------Origami could not push Origami's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to save Origami, someone from outside has to call out to her. Someone has to take her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, just who would extend their hands out to Origami, who inversed and spread despair into this world-------</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Origami…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">(………………!)</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice suddenly echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami lifted her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Shi-dou……)</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The voice that echoed in this empty world belongs to none other than Itsuka Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Creak* a crack opened in this white space.</p>
<p class="null-p">(W-hy----)</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's voice won't reach Shidou. However, Shidou continued shouting. So that he could call out to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't take on everything alone! I told you 5 years ago right!? That, you aren't alone…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ah----)</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami recalled back the memories from 5 years ago from within her when she heard Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">---I will take on your sadness…….! I will stop your anger……..! If you are in loss, come to me! Use me if you face a hopeless situation! I won't mind if you throw everything at me! So, so-----</p>
<p class="null-p">(A-aah…………)</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatever you do----please don't feel despair……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's voice in her memories, and Shidou's voice entering her ears, piled up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt the crack formed around the space getting larger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how many times you destroy this world, I will definitely do something about it! No matter how many times you fall into despair, I will definitely save you…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">(I------)</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, extend your hands! I----need you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----------"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she heard those words-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt her body move from another will that does not belong to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right; now that she thinks about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's quite similar to the weird feeling she felt during the date with Shidou today in this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">During that time, the memories of the Origami of the previous world unconsciously moved the Origami of this world.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_17.jpg">
<p class="null-p">But, now.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an opposite way, the memories of the Origami of this world were the one that made Origami extend her hands out to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's as if------she's telling Origami to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">---the world with nothing inside, started breaking down while making noises.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 7</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------Shi………dou………"</p>
<p class="null-p">A small light lighted, in the eyes of Origami who had the face of a corpse. Shidou opened his eyes in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….! Origami!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami slowly moved her eyes to see her surroundings, she opened her trembling lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I----I……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………….uu"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou hugged Origami at her suppressed words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like that day 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shi-dou……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami continued with a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank………….you. For………..calling me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Shidou wasn't here then……….an irreversible event might happen again" Tears fall off Origami's eyes and warmly moisten Shidou's shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fact that i……………killed my father and mother, will not disappear……………the crime that I killed the citizens of the city in the previous world will also……….never disappear.------even if it was made into something that [Never happened]………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………uh that's------"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't say something simple like 'wrong'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were events that did not happen in this world. Most likely; no one remembered those tragedies. ------those were events that [Never happened] thanks to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched his teeth before groaning out his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….That's right. That's…………..something you have to carry from now on"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the cruelest announcement.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou might not have the right to say such a thing. Even though it was to save many lives, it was Shidou's crime to change history by his own convenience.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou could not fake his words. He felt that lying to himself to make it sound beautiful would be a terrible insult to the Origami's parent of the previous world, the citizens of the city and also to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………I-i……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami's body trembled,</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Ah-</p>
<p class="null-p">yaaa………….AAaaaaaaaa…………….Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She clung onto Shidou's body and started crying loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's like that day, 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">The length of 5 years was just too long for a girl in 10 years old, and within those 5 years, Origami has been continuously disciplining herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou talked with Origami many times until now. He also spent a long time with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, at this very moment---------Shidou felt that he finally got to see the face of the real Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">---after who knows how long passed,</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami quietly let out her voice while still clung onto Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Shidou, I have something I want to apologize"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To me………..? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami let go of Shidou when he asked and continued while looking at his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The emotions……..i had for Shidou was definitely not------love nor affection………at all"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I………….just wanted something to rely on………I just threw that role to you, since you were coincidentally at the spot where I lost my parents. I just relied on you just so that I can lie to myself about my weakness…………..just for that selfish emotion, I caused many problems for you………..i apologize to you from the bottom of my heart"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou *Fuu* exhaled before lifting the side of his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Well that's an honor"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami unexpectedly opened her eyes at Shidou's reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At the very least, i…………am glad that I met Origami…..that's what my heart feels. Well, I do suffer some problems but…………if the reason why you rely on me is because of that emotion then, I should be thankful for that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said it with a trembling voice. Tears ooze out from her eyes again.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing her tears-----Shidou made a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right……I have to return it back to you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Return……..back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami tilted her head in wonder at Shidou's words. Shidou [Aah] replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your tears weren't the only things-----you left with me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that Origami remembered when she heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago on that day. Origami remembered the words she said. She remembered the things she left with Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, I"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou looked at Origami's eyes and said that, Origami twitched her shoulders for a moment before her cheeks blushed in embarrassment and------</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_11_18.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Making, an awkward but definite----smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instantly-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami opened her eyes in surprised, the black Astral Dress covering her body released a blinding glow and turned pure white.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the original appearance of the Spirit-Origami, he saw in the previous world</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, several [Wing] floating nearby turned into light particles and disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou………I"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her appearance when she was making a smile while wearing that wedding dress Astral Dress,</p>
<p class="null-p">Made her look like a real Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gripped the hands supporting Origami's shoulders and pulled Origami over to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh------------?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami let out an unexpected voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">[This] was his final goal from the start. No matter how much he increases the Spirit's affection level; a Spirit's Reiryoku won't be sealed unless this action was done.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou might be the one that poured strength into his arms but; was it because of his sense of duty to finish his mission?----Or was it because of his own desire? He couldn't decide which was correct.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's lips piled on top Origami's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Origami's body trembled for a moment, she entrusted her body to Shidou and placed her body weight on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she did that; the pure white Astral dress Origami was wearing left a path of glitter before dissolving into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their lips separated and Origami widens her eyes at her Astral dress that disappeared into light.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she did that; the Spirits, who fought with the [Wing] descended behind her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He slightly raised his hands to tell them that everything was over. Everyone then, let out a exhale of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka slightly frowned her eyebrows when she saw a half-naked Origami leaning against Shidou but, *Fuun* she snorted before folding her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun……..oh whatever. This exception is only for today, Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a wry smile at Tohka but………..he immediately felt something off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's word patterns were not to a transfer student who just came to the class a few days ago-----it felt more towards a rival that she has known for quite a while. "Tohka, you……….remembered Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu? What weird thing are you saying…………….Nu, but yeah. I think I forgot about her for a while………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka tilted her head in wonder. The other Spirits also made the same expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, shidou recalled the moment he sealed Kotori. The moment he kissed Kotori, he recalled back the memories sealed by using the pass.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's an invisible pass in between the sealed Spirits and Shidou even now. If that's the case then, by sealing Origami's Reiryoku, they might have shared the memories of the past using the pass.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..haha"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a wry smile at the unforeseen present. For a moment; it would be easier to build their relationship with Origami since everyone has no memories of her…………….this thought grazed his mind but, he swung his head and threw that thought away.</p>
<p class="null-p">With all that included-----it's still Origami. Well……….the future looks tough though.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was thinking about that, Origami slowly turned her head and looked towards the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">And,</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Thank you, Tohka, everyone. For fighting for me"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-----------!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, what did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. You're not sane yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuun, an honest Origami-san is cute"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, this is rare"</p>
<p class="null-p">Starting with Tohka; the Spirits (Except a few) looked shocked.</p>
<p class="null-p">But………oddly enough, Shiodu was not surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, the Origami over here has both the memories of the previous world-----and this world too.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it might have been too unexpected for her. Tohka looked away in panic and *Pui* faced aside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do-don't misunderstand! Err, I was just, doing that! I just did it because Shidou asked me to!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Tohka was worried about Origami too, she said it in a dishonest way.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----I see. Then I won't thank you. What a selfish Spirit. How ugly"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha………….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka brought her eyebrows closer at the words Origami said while opening half her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You bastard, aren't your words different from just now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no difference"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked away while Tohka shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a wry smile at that scene by reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">The future looks tough as expected.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue: Tobiichi Origami</p>
<p class="null-p">14th November. Shidou, who went to school, was sitting in his own seat while staring at the classroom's entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Morning homeroom was about to start in 5 minutes. The door would sometimes open and a classmate would come in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………, …………."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the time for school arrival now so, it was only normal for the door to open frequently but……………Shidou continued looking regardless and did not even moved an inch of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. It has been 3 days since Origami's Reiryoku was sealed at the high ground park. Today was the day that Origami, who finished her examinations, to finally appear in school.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits and the crew members starting with Kotori, were somewhat injured but everyone was alive. They were handling an inverse Spirit with that much power. The results could be said to be godsend.</p>
<p class="null-p">---well, Kotori was unhappy from the start to the end because her prided <Fraxinus>was messed up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuunn………."</p>
<p class="null-p">He can't calm down as expected. Shidou scratched his cheeks while sighing.</p>
<p class="null-p">He knows that he doesn't need to be that nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">However after the seal, the place Origami was sent to by members dispatched by <Ratatoskr>was not the heavily damaged <Fraxinus>but instead, she was sent to the underground institute owned by the organization so, Shidou has not met Origami even once after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, this would be the first time that he would be talking to Origami, who has both memories of this world and memories of the previous world, but more importantly------</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quietly touched his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Most of his worries were because of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was necessary to seal her Reiryoku, kissing right after being told [My feelings towards you wasn't love] was something plain unthinkable. Origami did not say anything at that spot but, Shidou felt very awkward there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, Origami isn't here yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka looked towards the classroom door like Shidou while folding her arms but, she suddenly raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that Shidou's speculation was correct; the same time Origami's Reiryoku was sealed, the other Spirits gained their memories of the previous world as well through the pass. Ever since that day, everyone recalled back Origami; starting with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone knows about events that did not happened in [This world]. For some reason, it felt a little weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">No-----nonetheless, it's good that everything went back to normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka………you're now finally able to call her with Origami huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou held his face up with his hands and said that while relaxing his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka then opened her eyes wide before replying back in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…….i-it's not that big of a deal. I just happen to do so"</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked away while folding her arms after saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka always called Origami in her full name [Tobiichi Origami]. He doesn't know what made her had a change of heart but……….this did not make Shidou feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Fumu, Origami isn't here yet I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. We came too fast huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">During the time Shidou and Tohka were talking, voices could be heard behind this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked over; he saw the Yamai sisters from next door and found out that they were taking an unnecessarily cool pose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Kaguya, Yuzuru. What is that pose. Rather, you girls are from 3rd group right. What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Kaguya *Baa* placed her hands in front of her face and looked over to him through the space between her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku, I don't care. I heard that fool finished her examinations and is finally coming back here. So, I am here for my payback for the previous world" After saying that, Kaguya *Kukuku* made an evil smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thinks back, they were badly beaten down by Origami in the previous world when she turned into a Spirit. It seems that she is holding a grudge……………looks like not everything about regaining the world of the previous world was all good and well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Yuzuru is here for revenge on Origami too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While making a wry smile at Kaguya, who was swinging her fingers and waiting for Origami, Shidou looked towards Yuzuru's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yuzuru did the opposite by swinging her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Deny. Yuzuru don't particularly mind. More importantly, I am happy that Master Origami changed her thoughts on Spirits"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai……….! Doesn't that make me a small person!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya shouted unbearably when she heard Yuzuru's words. Well, they were probably here to welcome Origami, even though their words are different. While looking at that small quarrel, Shidou *Fuu* exhaled and looked back at the class room door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so……she sure is late. Home room is about to----"</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stopped his words right before he finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, the door opened and Origami entered inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">He opened his eyes wide for an instant when he saw her. However, it was only natural. Origami's hair which should be long, was cut down to shoulder length and she completely returned to the appearance of the Origami Shidou knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and the Yamai sisters looked blank at Origami's transformation too, but they immediately regained their composure and talked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu…..you're here huh, Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku, nice guts. I'll acknowledge that courage of yours!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Kaguya welcomed Origami with a stance. However,</p>
<p class="null-p">"---Good morning, everyone"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Origami said that with a face showing no unpleasantness, Tohka and Kaguya hesitated as if they were let-down. Only Yuzuru [Reply. Good morning, Master Origami] replied back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, you…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stopped his words right before he finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were not the words he should be saying now; re-think back.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why Shidou said this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without any change of manner, he let out his usual voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a time; he said those words that he thought he would never say to her anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, nodded to Shidou's words before slowly walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then stopped right beside Shidou's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un…..Good morning"</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked into Shidou's eyes once more and said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing her face, Shidou was attacked with a weird feeling. It's true that her hair turned short and her appearance reverted to the Origami of the previous world but; maybe because she has the memories of this world or maybe she changed her emotions to the Spirits-----the atmosphere of her expression felt a little soft.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls probably felt that too. They looked a little troubled on how to respond to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But………….they will probably get used to it immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls and Origami are here.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scenery he seen many times in the previous world caused Shidou to squeeze tears out in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……? Are you okay, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she noticed Shidou's condition; Tohka peeked into Shidou's face and said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no……nothing"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tried to play it off and was about to-------wipe his tears with the back of his hands before *Hashi*, Origami grabbed his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Shidou. You can use this if you are going to wipe your tears"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-ah……sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, he extended his hands towards Origami. But, Origami was not holding any handkerchief or towel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami? What am I……."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, his head was pulled over and Shidou's view turned completely dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A slight dampness touched his cheeks and next off; a smell of soap and sweat mixed together touched his nostrils.</p>
<p class="null-p">A beat later, Shidou understood that his head was shoved into Origami's skirt. "uh…….! Uh………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He gasped at the unexpected events and even though he tried to run away, Origami would hold onto the back of his head and won't let go. Rather, the more he struggles, the harder his face gets pressed into Origami's under stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnnn! Hnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-what are you doing you bastard!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's panicked voice echoed and she made Origami let go of her hold. Shidou, who finally returned to a brighter place, looked around while exhaling violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha-haaa………., haaa……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami! What are you planning!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was just wiping his tears"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't joke with me! Wh-where are you wiping with!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka shouted, Origami pulled up her skirt without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He gasped in reflex. But, Origami wasn't wearing any panties under her skirt; instead, she was wearing a dark blue school swimsuit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excellent water absorbent"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..no, I don't mean that. Why are you wearing that……..it's November already and we have no pool class right……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought Shidou wanted the continuation for that time"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Origami took out the dog ear headband, dog tail and also the leather collar. Everyone in the class started whispering when they saw those abnormal goods.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……….Ah-re, what is Tobiichi-san doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened when she was resting……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, my friend saw Itsuka-kun and Tobiichi-san walking together……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, it's the promising girl that went all the way up to the top of a girl that you want as a lover on the first day she transferred you know!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it is Itsuka-kun after all"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Such conversations could be heard leaking around. Although he couldn't hear what the others were talking about, dangerous words such as [imprisonment], [Force], [Taming] were whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, it was probably something that can't be helped. The spirits might have recalled back the memories of the previous worlds but, this doesn't include his classmates which do not have the pass. They only know about the serious Origami before the weekends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-err, Origami. There are many people around so, you shouldn't say that kind of stuff……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need to worry"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami said that, she then………..brought her body closer to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-wwha…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo-you bastard!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka shouted the same time Shidou gasped. His classmates also turned noisy. Within them, there were people pointing their cell phone camera to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami moved her lips in a very calm manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's better to tell everyone about our relationship. Bad bugs won't get attached to you that way"</p>
<p class="null-p">"L-let go of Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka shouted, Origami silently looked over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----It's true that I stopped looking at Spirits as annihilation targets. However, Tohka. I will not hand Shidou over to you. As long as you follow Shidou, it doesn't change the fact that you are my enemy"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is my line! Hurry up and let go of Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka *Buun**buun* swung her arms while shouting. But, Origami was still close to Shidou with a cool face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-err…..Tobiichi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he was feeling the itching sights from his surroundings, Shidou let out his voice softly.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was one thing………….he just had to confirm with Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, if my memories are correct…………you told me that the emotions you have to me weren't love at that time right………..?" Shidou said that with sweat flowing down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami then nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errr…..then what is this"</p>
<p class="null-p">She just told him that this was to show the attentions collected from their surroundings on how close they are. This was no different from the previous world……….instead, it kinds of feel slightly escalated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami then looked straight up to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The emotion I have been harboring to Shidou wasn't love, but instead it was reliance"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-ou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The real love starts now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt a light dizziness when he heard Origami's words. It was dependence not love before. It felt as if a devil king made its announcement.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when that commotion was occurring, the chime signifying the start of homeroom rang.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nice timing. Shidou pulled away from Origami before letting out a voice to tell everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-see! Homeroom is about to start! Tohka and Origami, get to your seat. Kaguya and Yuzuru, get back to your classroom!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu-muu……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun………no choice. I'll be back at break time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Retreat. See you all later. Master Origami, let's talk again later"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Origami lowered their weapon, and the Yamai sisters went back to the</p>
<p class="null-p">3rd class, after they heard Shidou said that. Maybe they felt the end of the conclusion; the surrounding classmates also started returning to their own individual seats.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a large sigh while looking Origami as if he was slipping into congestion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Since Origami appeared in a very unexpected way, he missed the timing to tell her something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errr………let's see,------thank you for listening for my voice at that time. I am happy you came back. How should I put this……..i feel relieved. That you are attending the class normally…………it might be hard to fully accept the Spirits but, you can do it nicely since it's you so, that's why………..Uuuunnn"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he kept thinking about the scene for their reunion yesterday, he can't put his words properly when it actually became reality. Shidou scratched his head messily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………aah, forget it. I'll leave the annoying talk for later. Anyway----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lifted her face and looked into Origami eyes. "------I'll be counting on you from now on, Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------un"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami replied with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">How do you do. My favorite rewarded is Nenesu Totoru. It's Tachibana Koushi.</p>
<p class="null-p">I present you [Date A Live 11 Tobiichi Devil]. How was it? I would be glad if it was enjoyable.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a Devil, a devil. It's a 180 turn from the Volume 10-Tobiichi Angel. Which means Origami has hell ears. I can only smell danger in this.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is sudden but, who is that beauty on the cover page. Isn't she super cute. Isn't that an angelic and yet devilish smile. I thought it was Origami but, her hair is just too long for her. However, she looks exactly like Origami. I then came to a conclusion. This is definitely that. Origami's sister, Irogami-chan. I never would have imagined that a topic in Volume 2 would collect over here. This is ever since Rodriguez (Soukyuu no Karma Volume 1~8 in sale now).</p>
<p class="null-p">Another possibility would be Origami's daughter, Chiyogami. She's a beauty like her mother. Or it might be the new character Origami's cousin- Udagami-chan or Origami's second cousin-Kiraragami-chan or Koutakushi-chan who lived near Origami's old house or Kentagami-chan or Adzutematgami-chan[11F 1]. Nope.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well jokes aside, it's an impactful metamorphosis for Origami-san. It is definitely that. Shidou must have said [Long hair girls are nice]. Origami might have gotten the data even though Shidou did not say that. She then grew her hair long in one day. It's Origami after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving that aside, this volume is a little different.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually, I did the same thing once before but, the illustration page whenever I follow my custom and open the volume's illustrations…….well, you know right? Tsukako-san done a wonderful job. If you haven't seen it yet, then hurry up and go.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, everyone might already know this but a movie adaptation for the main project [Date A Live] has been decided! Waah *Clap**clap*.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a movie, a movie. This is amazing. It's Tohka's debut in the silver screen. I thought, if the Natsumi and Origami arc would get animated but, a movie adaptation was totally unexpected.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more; it isn't a summary but it seems that it's going to be an original story. I think there will be a follow-up soon, so look forward for it!</p>
<p class="null-p">Well then, I am once again able to release a book thanks to the support of many people.</p>
<p class="null-p">The illustrator Tsunako-san, the eyepatch of an illustration is super cute. Also; the supervisor, everyone in the editorial bureau, designer-san, the people related to business and marketing, the book shop owners, and also the readers you have this book in their hands; I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">It has been decided that next volume would be the collection of short stories [Date A Live Encore 3] and after that, [Date A Live 12] will be released.</p>
<p class="null-p">Okay then, I look forward to seeing you again.</p>
<p class="null-p">2014 August Tachibana Koushi</p>
