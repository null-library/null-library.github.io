<p class="null-h1">Prologue: Tobiichi Origami</p>
<p class="null-p">It was 5 years from now, when the girl known as Tobiichi Origami became [Special].</p>
<p class="null-p">She was smarter than a normal child; she was also excellent in her school grades and physical abilities but all of it was within normal limits and at the very least, it was at the level where her mother could act proud in the legal guardian association or parent-child meetings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her forte subject was math. Her weak subject was the Japanese language.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her favorite food was gratin. Her hated food was celery.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her future dream was----to be a cute wife.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world was filled with common sense and no one would doubt that. If she performs things within her limits then her friends and the adults would praise her. She was not really conscious of whether or not that gentle world would continue forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">But on that summer day, five years ago. Everything surrounding Origami changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">---on that day. The scenery that came welcoming Origami when she returned back to the city was not her familiar city scenery, but rather a hellish scenery burning in crimson flames.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Father, Mother……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami recalled back her parent's existence inside her house, she ran into the city wrapped in flames.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, it was an extremely reckless act. Even if Origami reaches back to her home, there was nothing she could do. However during that time, Origami was only thinking about checking her parent's safety.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not long later after Origami reached home, her father was holding her mother by the shoulders while kicking opening the door of her burning house before coming outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, Origami could only be relieved. Both her father and mother were alive. She was so happy she extended her hands to take her father's hand while tears were floating on her eyes. However, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">(-----------Eh?)</p>
<p class="null-p">A light suddenly poured down from the sky and easily blew Origami's body away. And------her parents were right under that light.</p>
<p class="null-p">They became small bits, and it was unthinkable that they had the shape of a human just a moment ago. (A-ah……..ah………..Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh-----------) Origami was clattering her teeth while looking up at the s The silhouette of the girl who released that light was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">(It was you………)</p>
<p class="null-p">--The one who killed my father and mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I won't forgive you……..! kill…………I will kill you…..! I will----definitely………!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Raising a voice filled with resentment, Origami vowed her revenge.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was Origami's meeting with the Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">It became the starting point of a long destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that day as her boundary, Origami changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she had no close relatives, she got taken into custody temporarily by an aunt living nearby but----that aunt was apparently previously related to the AST and, she was the reason for Origami's decision for her future life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her aunt, told her beforehand to keep this a secret from everyone else while telling Origami of a certain existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Spirits. The disaster killing the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Origami started becoming obsessed for knowledge and training.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was only one reason. The Spirit she saw that time. Find out its identity and kill her with her own hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">The young Origami did not know the specific way to do so. That's why-----she frantically continued training herself. She trained her body and mind with a strictness which could be mistaken with the ones from a Shura or Rakshasa to prepare herself to be able to take action immediately when the day she tracked down her parent's killer comes. Her forte subject was everything. There was no subject she was bad with. She mastered every knowledge and technique she could gather and completely destroyed the word [Impossible].</p>
<p class="null-p">She no longer cared whether or not she had likes or dislikes for food from that time on wards. She only needed the adequate amount of nutrients to make a strong body and didn't care for anything else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her future dream-----was only towards killing that Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Few years passed since then. Origami knocked on the AST door by her aunt's referral, and she became a Wizard after confirming that she had compatibility with the Realizer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's training when she became an AST member became even harsher.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world was filled with irrationality and no one would try to oppose it. Her limits could not achieve her goals no matter how hard she tried. In order to live through that cruel world, she could only continue being strongly conscious about the things she should do and her own meaning of life.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so-----Even that Origami had moments when she can feel at ease.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It was the young boy she met at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back, the emotion she had might be more like reliance compared to deep affections.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having lost both her parents, Origami was barely able to maintain her sanity thanks to his existence approaching her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why-----he became an underlying cause, and even though she got chased out from the AST because of him, she had not once harbored any hatred towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that she thought about it………..Origami might have felt her limits.</p>
<p class="null-p">The AST was an organization made to defeat the Spirits. The Realizer which is able to grant super powers to humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she had them both, she could not compare to a Spirit at all. That's why. Origami wanted more power.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the DEM industry, the company that invented the Realizer. She wanted the latest cutting edge equipment and the body to use it And, Origami-----</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: The Targeted Shidou</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">The smell was the odd thing he felt first in the dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">It smelled sweet like a flower or soap. It clearly didn't belong to him but, it suddenly tickled Shidou's nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn……."</p>
<p class="null-p">He stirred around while making a small groan before taking a stretch while lying down.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time after he did that, he felt a warm and soft feeling at the back of his hand and a soft [Kyaa] could be heard at the same time as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou forcefully awaken his cloudy consciousness, he rubbed his eyes while slowly raising his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">His familiar bed was the first thing that entered his view. On top of the white sheets, there were wrinkled blankets and bath blankets covered on top. But, it was clear that the feeling he felt on his hand was not that and more</p>
<p class="null-p">importantly, cloths don't give out voices. Shidou slowly raised his sights. When he did that,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu…..Good morning, Shidou-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl in her underwear was snuggling beside Shidou while relaxing her mouth charmingly and lifting her hair erotically.</p>
<p class="null-p">She should be in her mid-twenties; she had slender limbs and voluptuous breasts. She was a beauty with prided proportions that would make even models feel shame.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Hnn, aahh, Goo------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied in a half-awake state before-----stopping mid-way in his words. "U-uwaahhhhhhhh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time his brain understood the strange situation, Shidou took some distance back to make a gap between the beauty. But, this was on top of the bed. Having lost the space to support his butt, Shidou fell backwards just like that and hit his head on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guwahh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-ra a-ra. Mouu, you have to notice this you know, Shidou-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the girl giggling could be heard. After Shidou raised his head up in his face-up body posture, he looked up towards the bed with feelings of perplexity and surprise mixed together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Na……….Natsumi……!? Why are you-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">He then called the girl's name with a voice filled with panic. Yes. Shidou knows this girl. Natsumi. She was the Spirit that had her Reiryoku sealed by Shidou a few days ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean why, it's a greeting. I came here to wake up the sleepyhead you know"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Natsumi slowly raised her body, she [hnnn] stretched. Even though it was just that, it looked like that one scene that happens in movies.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was close to being attracted to Natsumi's beautiful gesture for one moment but, he immediately regained his composure and swung his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not that………..! No, I am curious as to why you're sleeping there too but, more importantly----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou rubbed his eyes once more; he also pinched his cheeks and confirmed that he wasn't daydreaming before continuing his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, why are you an adult!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Actually, this beautiful lady was not Natsumi's real appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi was a spirit with transformation abilities and this was her appearance after she transformed her body to match an ideal woman's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the current Natsumi should have her Reiryoku sealed away by Shidou. Thinking normally, there was no way she could use her transformation abilities. Even if she use her limited released powers, it should be only possible when the spirit's mental state is in considerable disorder.</p>
<p class="null-p">That means, Natsumi's body has probably fallen prey to a severe stress. No, from what he could see from Natsumi, it didn't look like her mental state was in disorder at all------</p>
<p class="null-p">The room door suddenly opened, just when Shidou was thinking about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what is going on, you were so noisy just now"</p>
<p class="null-p">A middle school aged girl with her hair tied into two sides (twin tails) with black ribbons entered the room. It was Shidou's sister, Itsuka Kotori. It seems, she felt suspicious and came to check the situation out because I raised a loud shout when I fell down to the floor just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………wait"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori looked around the room while opening the door, she looked at Natsumi who was half-naked, and Shidou who was on the ground before *twitch* her eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not caring that her panties could be seen from Shidou's angle, she swung her legs up before dropping her heel onto Shidou's stomach while he was facing upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the heck are you doing this early in the morningggggg!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyaann…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou bent his body like the shape of the word く , he held his stomach while groaning in agony. Maintaining the momentum from when she heel dropped Shidou, Kotori turned her back to Shidou and after both her legs landed on the ground, she slammed her left palm into her right fist and took a finishing pose. If this was a fighting game then, there was no mistake that the word [KO!] would be dancing between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun, gyaan huh. How about changing your occupation to an antique shop owner?" "Wh-why you……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he was raising a voice filled with pain, it seems Kotori did not bother to listen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, just what were you thinking about when you were going to commit an obscene act in the house which has your sister in it? I thought you were someone more discrete and prudent" "That's false accusations!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah, false accusations huh…….how indecent"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't judge it by the appearance of the word! Anyway, Natsumi was sleeping beside me when I woke up for some reason"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori looked towards Natsumi with a dubious look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's cheeks turned red when Kotori did that, and she opened her mouth embarrassingly while hugging her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-kun…….Pervert"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori's sights turned sharp, she once again lifted her leg and was about to drop her heel on Shidou. But, Shidou managed to block it in the nick of time and shouted as if he was trying to appeal to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ca-calm down! I didn't do anything, I am serious here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….You better be right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it's the truth! Rather, why can Natsumi turn into her adult version!? What happened!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori slowly moved her legs away from Shidou when he asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I think about it, I didn't tell you.------about Natsumi's condition"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Condition? What do you mean? Don't tell me the seal was not enough………..?" Shidou said that in a nervous tone. But, Kotori cast her eyes down and swung her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noo. The seal was successful. Just like the other spirits, Natsumi's reiryoku was properly sealed by Shidou." "Then………..did something happen to make Natsumi's mental state be in disorder!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he said that, Kotori made a complicated face while groaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuun……….that might be the case……..if you put it that way" "? What do you mean……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could not get any of the points at all. Shidou wring his neck. When he did that, Kotori bent down and brought her face closer to Shidou's ear in order to prevent Natsumi from hearing; she was probably being considerate. "…..you know, Natsumi's mentality is super weak right"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………ahh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his cheeks while maintaining a weird pose. Now that he thought about it, the untransformed Natsumi was a cluster of complexes and her mood would break even from little things.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's the case. Natsumi's ability appears much easier compared to the others"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-isnt that kind of dangerous……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuuun……nonetheless, her abilities only appear to transform her own body so I guess it will work out somehow for the time being. Most likely, she would naturally hide her real appearance when she feels embarrass and wants to escape from peoples eyes. We have no choice but to take time and let her get used to this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what are you two whispering about? Don't leave this onee-san out from the group"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an unnecessarily erotic pose, Natsumi said that while fixing her disordered hair. Not even a spec of a weak mentality could be felt and she was giving off a confident appearance. Now that he thought about it, Natsumi's personality will transform into something filled with confidence just like the word as if the person changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, you…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori stood up and sighed while opening her eyes half way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay to wake Shidou up but, do something about the habit of transforming whenever you like. If you keep that up, you will not mix into society no matter how long it takes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaan, you got angry because I took the role to wake Shidou-kun up huh. Your cute face will go to waste you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I didn't say that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, it's written on your face even if you don't say it. But see, Shidou-kun won't notice Kotori-chan even if you snuggled beside him with that body"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what did you say!?"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_8.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">After Natsumi said that while folding her arms and lifting her big breasts, Kotori shouted in an unbearable state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the truth right? It might look promising in some specific aspects but, how should I say this, it's lacking firepower or it's a work of art with the wind resistance being close to zero"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do-don't look down on me! I am still in puberty!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeeh……..but breasts stop growing around the age of 15 you know?" "I-I am still 14! Forget that, why are you acting big for! You might have a nice body in your transformed form but, your real body is lower than mine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Kotori shouted, Natsumi's expression which was filled with confidence turned into astonishment. There was a hallucination as if the surroundings suddenly just got dark. If this was a manga then, there would probably be sound effects like [Gaaaan] or [Zuuun] appearing on top of Natsumi's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Li-like I thought……Kotori thinks that way of me. U-uuuu……I look like an idiot. Turning all jolly alone after making friends………..it is impossible for people to accept someone like me………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi covered her face with both her hands and her shoulders were trembling periodically. I see, her mentality was as weak as tofu. Kotori made a [Oh crap] face before walking to Natsumi in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I don't think that. How should I say this, that was just the spur of the moment or, that was a tit for tat errr……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu….uu…….it's okay Kotori-chan, don't force yourself. Sorry to make you keep someone like me company……I am more of a midget than Kotori-chan anyway………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I am serious! I don't think that way!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But……I am more of a midget than Kotori-chan anyway….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-that is not true!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Then, Kotori-chan is more of a midget than me….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U, th-that's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori hesitated while sweat was flowing down her forehead. When she did that, large teardrops started to form on Natsumi's eyes and she started crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was a lie like I thoughttttt! It's the kind lie that hurts a person's heart the most rightttt!" "Ah……aaah, mouuu! That's right! I am more of a midget than Natsumi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori gave up and said that. Natsumi then stopped crying like it was a lie just now and *pan**pan* started laughing on the bed this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aha-hahahhaa! She's a midget! Kotori-chan is a midget!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to comprehend what happened, Kotori went blank for a moment but her sights turned sharp immediately and she glared at Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-you…..you tricked me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaa! The midget is attacking!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi made an innocent smile while jumping off the bed and exited the room before heading to the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why you little, wait there……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori chased after Natsumi and *batabata* ran down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">---and finally, peace visited Shidou's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..I guess I'll wash my face"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou *ya-re ya-re* made a tired sigh before slowly standing up from his place on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although there was a morning wake up surprise, that day's morning was shockingly [Normal] if that event was excluded.</p>
<p class="null-p">He washed his face, changed his clothes, finished his breakfast with Kotori, who let Natsumi get away in the end, and left the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, a cheerful voice echoed from the mansion next door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he brought his eyes there, he saw a girl in the same Raizen high school uniform waving her hands to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had characteristic long night black hair and shinning crystal-like eyes; she was a girl whose beauty seemed almost artificial. She had a well-proportioned nose bridge, and sakura petal-like lips. Anyone who sees her will feel a somewhat artificial mystique aura coming from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the lovely expression on her face was enough to flip that impression of her around; it was a cheerful and intimate smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yatogami Tohka. She was the Itsuka family house's neighbor and at the same time Shidou's classmate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ou, Tohka. Good morning"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, good morning!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou waved his hand, Tohka made a satisfied smile while making a big nod. All of her behavior was filled with life and cheerfulness. As usual, she was living her life to the fullest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nice weather today too! It feels warm and cozy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, it doesn't feel like November at all.-----wait, now that I think about it, where are Kaguya and Yuzuru? Don't tell me they overslept?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tilted his head and looked behind Tohka. The Yamai Kaguya and Yuzuru sisters who were living in the same mansion as Tohka could not be seen there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, both of them went already. It seems they were having a competition on who would reach the school first"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that [normal] reason, Shidou unintentionally made a wry smile. Kaguya and Yuzuru are very close sisters but, they love competing more than the second meal of rice (I was going to say third meal but, it seems they competed on not having meals three times already and it was invalid for competing anymore) and would come up with something to compete.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, let's go"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka made a cheerful nod when Shidou said that. They then started walking to school along the path they frequently used to get there.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was also a scene from their usual normal days.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was one part of the everyday life that they repeated several times these past few months. The strange scenery of the special existence-Spirits that crosses the category of logic had become something normal to Shidou before he noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….ouch ouch"</p>
<p class="null-p">And suddenly, Shidou's neck hurted when he looked up to the sky and he puckered his face. "Nu? What's wrong, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…….I fell off the bed this morning"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu, you have to be careful" Tohka said that worryingly. Shidou said [I am okay] and made a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't fall off normally. Today, Natsumi-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi? What happened to Natsumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, nothing"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou swung his hand to trick her. Tohka made a dubious face but, she immediately recalled something and opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah Shidou, speaking of Natsumi, there was something I've been wondering about from before"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi is called natsumi[1] because she is loved by everyone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Ah---"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he was relieved that the topic changed, it was only for a brief moment. Sweat flow down Shidou's cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">The word [Natsumi] was taught to Tohka by Shidou a few days back ago. The meaning is [I like you]. ……..well actually, It was something Shidou made up to trick Tohka when he called her Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-that's right. Words like [Love] and [Like] are good ones as expected. It's often used as names. You see, Yamabuki from our class is named [Ai] too if I am correct right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooo! I see!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought up something random and Tohka hit her hand as if she was impressed from the bottom of her heart………….his chest hurting. Incidentally, Yamabuki from his class was [Ai[2]] not [Ai[3]]. After talking about that while walking, both of them reached the high school.</p>
<p class="null-p">He changed his shoes like usual, climbed the stairs as usual, entered the classroom as usual and reached his seat as usual. Shidou's seat was the second seat from the window, Tohka's seat was beside him…………for some reason, the moment Shidou entered the classroom, his classmates were sending cautious looks to him but, well he decided to now worry about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's left was to prepare for classes and he should just have a random conversation with Tohka until homeroom starts. This was also the same as usual. ---But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked at the seat to his left silently.</p>
<p class="null-p">The seat was still vacant. Shidou's classmate----Tobiichi Origami's seat. Yes. There was something missing in his days which should be normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou called her name with a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, Tohka looked towards Origami's seat when she noticed him doing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was in the AST-----a member of the team that aims to exterminate the Spirits. And of course, Origami was not close to Tohka who was a Spirit. No, their relationship was so bad it's even proper to call it the relation of dogs and monkeys.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, what is going on, he could feel that Tohka's eyes had some kind of complex emotion inside when she was looking at that vacant seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that was something only natural. Shidou made a small nod to answer Tohka's word before sighing and recalled back the memory of when he last saw Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">---it happened a few days earlier. Tenguu city was in danger.</p>
<p class="null-p">The DEM industry dropped an artificial satellite with explosion arts installed on the city from the satellite's orbit. Thanks to the efforts of Shidou, the spirits and <Ratatoskr>, they managed to stop it at the last minute but, DEM industries had one secret move prepared.</p>
<p class="null-p">A bomb with the same power as the one installed on the artificial satellite was dropped towards Tenguu city from an airship.</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely depleted of energy, Shidou and the group were in a predicament. There was nothing left they could do. At that time-----a Wizard appeared from the skies and destroyed it with one hit. That was Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What….was that"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou mumbled that as if to ask himself that, he placed his hands on his forehead and immersed himself in thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking normally, that event was just Origami coming to save Shidou and the group from a pinch. All he had to do was to raise both his hands in happiness and thank Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the situation was not something that could end that easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">The CR-unit Origami was wearing-----instead of the official basic equipment's from the JGSDF that she usually wears; the unit was something from DEM industries.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what does that mean? In the end, Origami did not descend towards the gang and left the spot after leaving a</p>
<p class="null-p">meaningful sight to them. He thought he would ask her in details next time they meet but………… And at that moment, he could hear a familiar chime from the speaker installed in the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Oh, it's homeroom"</p>
<p class="null-p">The students scattered around the classroom quickly started returning to their own seats. When he looked out the window, he could see several boys and girls slipping pass the school gate while it was closing. But------Origami could be not seen among them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….She's absent today huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a small sigh. Disappointment and------a slight relief was mixed in his sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, there was no problem fixing this issue. Even though he was going to head back today, it's better to visit Origami's home with an excuse like a home visit.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was thinking about that, the teacher Okamine Tamae AKA Tama-chan entered the classroom. Stand, bow, sit. After performing the usual greeting, Tama-chan-sensei opened the attendance book.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Okay, gooood morning everyone. Let's be in high-spirits today too"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan-sensei said it in a dark voice compared to the high-spirits she said, and dropped her sights to the attendance book. The class was worried when they saw Tama-chan-sensei in a downhearted mood compared to her usual self. "Eh…….What, what happened Tama-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doesn't she look un-energetic?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, perhaps the marriage interview was no good again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah---…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Random speculation came flying from left and right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Tama-chan did not hear that, *Haaa* she made a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before we take attendance, there is sad news I need to tell everyone……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Tama-chan frowned her eyebrows like the word 八 . Seeing her weird state, everyone in the class said […….Like I thought].</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I kept telling her not to go all out on the photo for the marriage interview…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true they won't even let you meet if the first impression is bad but, it's bad if the gap is too big"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-yaa, but would she go through all the trouble to announce that during the homeroom?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh, what is it then"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She went through a scam marriage and lost all her inheritance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaah, now that's sad"</p>
<p class="null-p">Etc etc, many rumors started to form. Tama-chan gave a warning by *cough**cough* purposely coughing before continuing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually……..Tobiichi-san is going to transfer schools due to sudden circumstances……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh……..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stood up by reflex when he heard Tama-chan-sensei's words. Beside him, Tohka was also opening her eyes wide in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone in the class was surprised too but, Shidou's reaction was too big. Everyone's sights gathered on Shidou. Normally, it was an uncomfortable situation. But right now, Shidou didn't have the leisure to worry about it. He slammed on the table and threw questions at Tama-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa-wait a second. Origami is going!? What's going on!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-even if you tell me that………I don't know the details. Tobiichi-san suddenly called me and told me she was transferring, and will send the necessary documents later…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou could not hide his discomposure and hit his forehead with his hand. The surrounding classmates started whispering. Everyone probably thought Shidou's panic was unexpected.-----No, speaking it in a more correct term, they might be shocked that Shidou did not hear the situation from Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-so……….Which school was she transferring to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou continued his words as if he was imploring. As long as he knows the school's name, it was possible to have</p>
<p class="null-p"><Ratatoskr>investigate it for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems Shidou's desperate state could be conveyed to Tama-chan. She quickly looked through the printout pinched between the attendance book and raised her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ab-about that……."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that expression was filled with bewilderment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-a school in Britain…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou heard those words and gulped down.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"U……..u-ugaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was in a room of the spirit mansion located beside the Itsuka house.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi was planting her face into a pillow while shouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, even though she disliked the dust puffing up nearby, she continued swinging her limbs and *poof**poof* it was hitting the bed. She would sometimes cover her face from recalling back memories while writhing in agony. It was like she was possessed or sick, or maybe a high school boy who had his hidden treasure under his bed discovered by his mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-uguuuu………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After continuing those actions for a few more minutes, Natsumi lied on top of the bed completely exhausted. Nonetheless, it's not like she was satisfied. It was just simply because she got exhausted from going wild.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi waited to recover some of her stamina before heavily raising her body and looking at a mirror placed on the wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">A small, thin, and dark-faced girl was shown on it. At the very least, there were no traces of the onee-san who gave off an attractive and lovely scent when she was snuggling beside Shidou. This was Natsumi's real appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhh…….mouu, why am I like this"</p>
<p class="null-p">She made her hair messy and once again threw herself onto the bed. Nonetheless, it's not like Natsumi hated her real self like last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">………no, it would be a lie if she said she had no dissatisfaction with her body at all. She would like to be taller or, her breasts to be bigger; the insufficient parts she wanted to increase was endless.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that complex was quite an improvement compared to the Natsumi a while back. Natsumi has come to accept her real appearance that she hated until she could not bear it.</p>
<p class="null-p">This and that was all thanks to Shidou and the other spirits. They [Transformed] Natsumi----and more importantly, they [accepted] Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was thankful to them. That is why, Natsumi was thinking of a way to repay them somehow. And the results was, she decided to wake everyone up in the morning for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it wasn't that simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">For starters, things went well when she sneaked into Shidou's room but, a weird nervousness fell upon Natsumi the moment she thought of waking Shidou up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once she wakes Shidou up, just what kind of answer should she give if he asked why Natsumi was here. No, it's obvious the answer was she went there to wake Shidou up but, there is a possibility he would ask back [Why?]. No no, that is still better. If Shidou is someone that gets in bad mood once he wakes up then there might be a possibility he might scold her………? No no no, more important than that, if-----</p>
<p class="null-p">Etc etc etc, after thinking all that, Shidou suddenly [u……….nn……..] moaned while turning over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's nervousness reached its peak in an instant…………..and before she knew it, Natsumi's body turned into her Onee-san version which was supposed to be sealed away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strangely enough, the only thing that was supposed to change was her outer appearance but, she would oddly be very big-hearted when she turned into that appearance, and was brimming with confidence……….All the things Natsumi could not do before could easily be done now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Specifically speaking, she could snuggle beside Shidou in an underwear appearance, make his heart start pumping hard when he wakes up, or even trick Kotori by faking her cries…………those types of examples.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi then ran away from Kotori and reached her room and laughed for a period of time before turning back to normal and------</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugooooo………"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, she fell into a tremendous self-hatred.</p>
<p class="null-p">She hated her weak heart. She was completely soft and frail. If this goes on, a soft tofu was tons more times sturdier than her.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment. The chime rang without any warning at all, and Natsumi twitched her shoulders. And judging from the sound, it was not from the entrance but rather it was the chime installed in front of her room.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was close to transforming to her adult version from the shock but, she placed her hands on her chest and somehow managed to suppress the heartbeat. After fixing her breathing, Natsumi walked towards the door while walking silently for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">For an instant, she thought Shidou and Kotori chased her to the mansion but, both of them should have gone to school already. Then who is………..</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-who is it…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing in front of the door, Natsumi timidly asked (She was scared to peek at the door scope for some reason) before, a soft voice answered back soon. The door was made sturdy just in case for any emergencies but, since there was a mike and speaker installed on it like an intercom, it was possible to have a conversation through the door. "E-err……it's Yoshino"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshinon is here too~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi brought her eyebrows closer from the unexpected voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, it's not like she didn't know the owner of the voice. It was Yoshino. She was one of the spirits living in the mansion just like Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what business does she have with her? Natsumi wrung her neck while placing her hand on the door knob.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, she then noticed her appearance when she saw her reflection in the mirror on the shoe box (closet?) door and immediately gasped. Because she was rolling around on her bed until now, the hair she carefully combed during the morning turned totally messy without any trace of neatness left. Maybe it was because of the amount of hair she has; it totally exploded because she let her guard down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai…..wait a moment!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? O….okay"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yoshino replied through the door, Natsumi ran through the corridor to the washroom and used a big brush to fix her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Al……alright"</p>
<p class="null-p">About 3 minutes later. Natsumi put down the brush and ran back to the door. Of course, it was far from satisfaction but, it can't be helped. At the minimum, she probably managed to exorcise the unsightly bed hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi took a deep breath before putting on her sandals and opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time she did that, a small girl standing there bowed her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errr………Good morning, Natsumi-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a cute girl with a casket hat with a cute design on her head and a puppet in her left hand. Her soft wavy hair was blue like the sea and her eyes were like glittering sapphires. "Gooood morninggg Natsumi-chan. How are you doing---?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next off, the puppet worn on Yoshino's left hand greeted her while skillfully moving its hands. It was Yoshino's friend [Yoshinon].</p>
<p class="null-p">"A……Go-ood………ning"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi averted her sights away in difficulty before greeting back…………….If she was in her adult appearance, she would probably say [Good morning Yoshino and Yoshinon. What brings you here? Perhaps you came to visit me? Yaaan, Natsumi is moved---] and hug her but……….that level was too hard for Natsumi now. The silence</p>
<p class="null-p">continued for a few moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">---What should I do in this situation? She came all the way here so, [Talking while standing is tiring so, come on in. I have good tea] naturally urging her like that would be a good choice for a good woman? However if it was something she could finish here then, Yoshino might be the one to be considerate instead. She passed through the room, and finishes her business with one or two words after having some tea. In a way, there might be some people who thinks that it's a good idea to enjoy having a fun conversation but, that would be a heartless excuse of a monster with the communication skills to be able to converse with someone naturally. If she could do that then, Natsumi wouldn't be silently standing frozen at the door. Incidentally, Natsumi has no idea what tea was good even though her room has tea in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Neee neee Natsumi-chan. How long should we be doing this? Can we enter the room please?"</p>
<p class="null-p">[Yoshinon] moved its mouth when Natsumi was in agony with sweat flowing down her forehead. What a lifeboat at an amazing timing. She was a good women compared to Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"uu, Yoshinon………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino warned [Yoshinon] but, Natsumi quickly swung her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it's okay. Come in. It's nothing much anyway…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Natsumi-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it's totally okay. Rather, I was thinking of saying that anyway…….:</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi urged Yoshino and [Yoshinon] into the room after saying that in a shrill voice. Yoshino bowed down and said I will be intruding before taking off her shoes, neatly arranged them and entering the room. Incidentally, Natsumi's shoes were thrown aside in a ハ shape…………..Natsumi somehow felt embarrassed and secretly arranged her shoes properly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-sit anywhere you like. I will prepare the tea………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After urging Yoshino into the living room, she took a tea bag from the shelves installed in the room and put it into a cup before pouring hot water into it. There were proper tea leaves there but, she had no clue how to prepare tea with them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi lined up the tea and random snacks on the table before sitting at the opposite side of Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"G-go ahead………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry…….Thank you very much"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino slightly lowered her head and took a sip of the tea. Natsumi did the same and placed the cup to her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">But since both Natsumi and Yoshino didn't have a talkative personality, silence flowed in again at this moment. Natsumi was giving off the feeling of [I am drinking tea so I can't talk] but, she was taking peeks at Yoshino. Although she invited her into her room following the flow, just what kind of business does she have where she has to visit Natsumi. Nothing came to Natsumi's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">But at that moment, Natsumi reached one possibility.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place, before Shidou sealed Natsumi's Reiryoku, she caused an incident and dragged Shidou and the spirits into it. Everyone forgave her already but……….It was not weird if there was at least one person that only showed her agreement because everyone else had and still felt some resentment towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more, [Yoshinon] was the thing Natsumi transformed into…………..it was Yoshino's irreplaceable friend. She waited for the moment when Shidou and the other spirits went to school and it was not weird she was going to have her pay back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errr, Natsumi-san…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiii!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She got called out suddenly. Natsumi twitched her shoulders and hid under the table like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-sorry, I……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi said that while shaking the table causing Yoshino and [Yoshinon] to tilt her head in a puzzled manner. "Why are you apologizing? Haa, don't tell me you put a dose of something inside the tea Yoshino drank!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-eehh……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, Yoshino is going to collapse after a sudden sleepiness attacks her. Inside the hazy consciousness, the last thing Yoshino saw was Natsumi-chan licking her lips while making a lustful smile……….Welcome to the Yuri- yuri[4] world!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I didn't, there's no way…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't stand it and raised her face. But, since she hid under the table, Natsumi bumped her head under the table severely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-are you okay, Natsumi-san…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah….i-I'm okay……."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Natsumi replied back to Yoshino who said that worryingly, she slowly got out from under the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">But again, it was thanks to [Yoshinon] that the nervousness got cleared, even though it's a little. Natsumi silently took a deep breath before asking Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So………soo…….what do you want with me……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Natsumi said that, Yoshino [Errr………] spoke something ambiguously before her cheeks started to blush while looking away. But, she immediately decided to try over again and looked straight at Natsumi's eye before opening her small lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err………Na-Natsumi-san started living here recently so, I thought you don't know……..about this city………" Yoshino *kokun* gulped down the nervousness before continuing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it is okay………with you, I thought of……..giving you a tour of the city………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi opened her eyes wide from the unexpected sentence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what did she take Natsumi's reaction for, Yoshino swung her hands in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-errr……………….I am not too clear about the city too and I might not be so useful to you but………..I think I can do something simple like giving a simple tour. Errrr, really, if it isn't any trouble for you……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh-aahh"</p>
<p class="null-p">While hearing Yoshino's words, Natsumi covered her eyes with both her hands. The reason was simple. Yoshino was so dazzling that she could not look straight at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was for a moment, she hated herself for thinking something disgusting like Yoshino might be here for revenge. She even thought that it was an unforgivable blasphemy to even look at Yoshino with her corrupted views. "u-errrr, sorry, I didn't think you would hate it that much…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….you're wrong. That's not it…….Its just, I am sorry to have been born……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Na-natsumi-san………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino tilted her head in a troubled manner. Natsumi slowly opened her eyes before looking back at Yoshino after she was able to look straight at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then moved her sights away while letting out a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………eerr, okay……..I am counting on you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino's voice bounced happily when Natsumi replied and made an angelic smile. Natsumi was close to covering her eyes again when she saw that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But………….why would you go so far to do something like that for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While half of it was a pure question the remaining half was to hide her embarrassment, when Natsumi asked that in that manner while scratching her cheeks, Yoshino shrugged her shoulders before answering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was…..a little happy. At this time, Shidou-san and the others would go to school so………….I can talk a lot with</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi since you have come here………….that's what I thought. Also, err…….." Yoshino's cheeks turned red before continuing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-we……are friends so………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Yoshino closed her eyes tightly in embarrassment. Natsumi's face turned completely red when she saw that.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_9.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Uwahh……what's with this girl, I want to marry her……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Fueee!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oooyaaa?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She accidentally proposed from Yoshino's cuteness. Yoshino twitched her shoulders from Natsumi's words that unconsciously spilled out from her mouth, and [Yoshinon] was stroking its chin. Natsumi then *buun**buun* swung her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No-nothing! Mo-more importantly, you're going to give me a tour of the city right!? Then let's go, let's go quickly, let's go now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errrrrrr………O-okay"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi pushed the puzzled Yoshino and exited the room.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"------The number you have dialed cannot be connected to because it is either in a place where signals can't reach or it does not have any power. Please wait a while before---------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of the Raizen high school gates. Shidou clenched his teeth after hearing the announcement from his phone receiver.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was 9:30am. Of course it was still class time but, after being told that Origami was going to transfer schools, Shidou could not stand still and left school early after acting sick.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka looked worried but……………..she decided to stay in school in the end. He thought it was not a good idea to let the spirits meet Origami with her intentions still unknown to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He recalled back to the last time he saw Origami-----the time while she was in DEM's CR-unit. He clenched the phone which was repeatedly giving off an automated announcement.</p>
<p class="null-p">After being told that Origami was going to transfer during homeroom, he tried calling her several times but, none of them connected at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou cut the line and put the phone in his phone before letting out a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regret and a powerless feeling were gradually filling his heart. Origami was wearing DEM's equipment. Even after seeing that, somewhere in Shidou's heart, he thought Origami would still come to school normally. He never would have thought his days with Origami would collapse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh--------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lifted his face and started running.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was only one goal, it was Origami's mansion. He doesn't know if Origami was still there but……….even if she was not there, she might have left some kind of clue there. Whatever the reason may be, he has to hurry now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….*huff* ……………*huff*"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou continued running without caring about the pain coming from his lungs and legs. If he takes his time then, he felt that Origami would go to a place where his hands can never reach.</p>
<p class="null-p">After running for who knows how long, Shidou reached the mansion Origami was living in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa………..haa………."</p>
<p class="null-p">All the palpitation and fatigue Shidou had been restraining until now, attacked him at once when he stopped his legs. He placed his hands on his knees for a while and arranged his breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please be here……Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou entered the entrance with feelings like praying, he typed in Origami's room number in the intercom.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----no reply came no matter how long he waited. He repeated this for a 2nd and 3rd time but, the results was the same. Maybe her room was vacant already………..or maybe she was ignoring him.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Shidou was thinking that, a woman most likely a resident of the mansion entered the mansion through the entrance with her shopping bags in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..*hmf*"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou left the intercom, he acted like a resident checking his mailbox and faced his back to the woman. The woman then typed her password in a familiar manner and entered the mansion through the opened automated door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her do that with the side of his eye, Shidou gulped before waiting for the woman to be gone and slipped into the automated door the moment the door was going to close.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, it's only for this time……."</p>
<p class="null-p">While apologizing in a soft voice, Shidou walked into the corridor.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then ascended to the next floor with the escalator and reached Origami's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………okay"</p>
<p class="null-p">After making a small nod, Shidou pushed the intercom installed beside the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">*pin pon* He could hear the sound echo throughout the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">But as expected, there was no response. Shidou knocked on the door while talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, it's me. Please answer me if you are here"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was no reply. While thinking it was a useless act, Shidou placed his hands on the door knob.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows. The reason was simple. He could not feel the resistance from the knob he imagined when twisting the door knob.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The door………..isn't locked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having a realization pass through his head, Shidou felt a small hope shining into his head. After Shidou made up his mind, he inserted energy into his hand and opened the door in one go.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami!" But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lost the small hope he had in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">---by the scenery of the empty room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou opened his eyes wide, he simply took off his shoes and entered the room. Even though he went to search in the corridor, living room and also bedroom………..it was the same. Forget furniture, not even the intruder/escapee preventing traps were left there even though it was something laid out carefully. He even thought that he entered a vacant room by mistake for an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell is this……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou placed his hands on his head and unenergetically collapsed onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like this result wasn't within his predicted possibilities. Rather, the worst possible outcome was regularly floating in his head right when he was running here after leaving the school. But, when that reality was brought forward to him, it became a tremendous impact and squeezed Shidou's chest. "Where…..did you go, Origami……."</p>
<p class="null-p">But staying here like this was meaningless. Shidou scratched his head before putting strength into his legs and stood up from the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then headed to the next location.</p>
<p class="null-p">He headed to a place that might have clues about Origami-----the JGSDF Tenguu city garrison.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, that place was on a whole different level than Origami's mansion. It was a JGSDF garrison vital to the country's defense; what's more the existence of the AST was a secret to the public citizens. 8 or 9 out of 10 times, he will probably be forced away from the gate without them hearing anything he says.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no place that came to mind left. He started moving forward as if to cling onto that small possibility. However, even though he determined the next place he was going to head, Shidou stopped his legs the moment he left the mansion's entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. One girl was in the alley facing towards the mansion's entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a characteristic girl with hair that reaches her shoulders, white skin, and an expressionless face like a doll. Yes------It was the girl Shidou was looking for, Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou called her name with a loud voice, he quickly ran towards Origami. He then grabbed both her shoulders. Overenthusiastically………..that was also a reason but he felt that she might disappear somewhere again if he doesn't catch her properly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just where were you!? What's with suddenly transferring schools! Your room is empty too-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou continued talking, Origami silently made one finger stand. She then placed her index finger on Shidou's lips to interrupt his words and stared back at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then,</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------I want to talk alone with you. Follow me"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying it in a quiet tone, Origami slipped past Shidou's hands by turning her heel and walked towards the back-alley.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-O-Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Shidou called out to her, Origami did not stop her feet. She did not turn back and continued walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou slightly brought his eyebrows together, he lightly hit his cheeks before following after Origami. He went looking for Origami to talk to her in the first place anyway. There was nothing to lose.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, no matter how long they walked, Origami would not stop. They kept going deep into a back-alley and the surroundings started to be less populated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey……..Origami, where are we going?" "Almost there"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that without taking a glance at Shidou and continued walking in silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he felt that it was weird, he just followed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the moment----- he turned a corner for who knows how many times already, while he was following Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-re…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes wide in surprise. Origami who should have turned the corner a moment ago was not there at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami? where are we……..------!?" In an instant----Shidou gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when he thought someone suddenly grappled him from behind, a handkerchief covered his mouth and nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-this is…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He took a big breathe because of the sudden event. And immediately, a strong odor struck his nose and at the same time, a feeling as if the ground was wobbling attacked him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuaa-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">His view got distorted and his consciousness turned hazy. It became a hard task to stand not long later and-----Shidou collapsed onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: The Radiant Goetia</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Shidou's missing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a middle school classroom, Kotori made a suspicious voice while pushing her cellphone onto her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">The chime for lunch time rang and Kotori received a transmission from <<Fraxinus>>on her cellphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt something strange about it and picked up the phone immediately after changing into her black ribbons-----she then heard a report from her subordinates. "What do you mean? It's school time now you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah…………That should be the case but, judging by analyst Murasame's report ……… he went back 1 hour before class "</p>
<p class="null-p">"He went back early?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. From what we heard from Tohka-chan, it seems Tobiichi Origami suddenly changed schools……." "What did you say…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori raised her eyebrows. It's impossible to think that Tobiichi Origami would change schools without telling Shidou anything about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----it's not like she had no clue about the reason for the strange event. Yes, the last time Origami appeared in front of Shidou and the group was when she was wearing the DEM CR-unit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami opposed DEM before to protect Shidou once but, she could not deny the chances that Origami might have make some kind of secret with DEM.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or maybe-------it might be possible to think that she got brainwashed by DEM. That's because, the enemy was that DEM industries. It's not weird if they did something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou probably thought of the same thing as Kotori. There was no way that he could stand still and went looking for Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That idiot…….he didn't tell us anything……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori clicked her tongue in irritation, she continued her words softly to avoid having the surroundings hear her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A disappearance at this timing……smells fishy to me. Worst come to worst, he might have gotten kidnapped by the DEM.------how are the girls?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……..Tohka-chan, the Yamai sisters, and Miku-chan are having lunch in their respective schools.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi-chan went out with Yoshino-chan to play in the city."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. ----They might not be uneasy yet but, we can't keep them fooled for too long. Anyways, use all personnel and look for Shidou's whereabouts. I will head back to <<Fraxinus>>soon too. We have to find him before the girls go home no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her subordinate's reply came from the phone's receiver. After Kotori ended the call, she put her phone into her pocket and separated from the wall. And while changing her ribbons, she walked towards her friends eating their bentos with their tables joined together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kotori-chan, you finished your call?" "Who was it? Your brother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her friends asked her. Kotori made a fuzzy smile before squatting down on the spot while holding her stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U…….unnn"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what's wrong Kotori-chan, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I feel a little sick……sorry, I am going back early today………can you tell teacher for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind but…are you okay? Want to go to the nurse room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. Okay then, I am counting on you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori took her bag while making a painful face before slowly walking out of the classroom and----aimed towards the rooftop instead of the entrance.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….u-uh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After releasing a soft moan, Shidou gradually opened his eyes. "Where…..am I….."</p>
<p class="null-p">His view was hazy. Shidou tried raising his right hand to rub his eyes and-----he raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">His right hand wouldn't move. No……more specifically, he could not bring his arms forward as if both his wrists were connected behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">After 10 seconds. Right in the middle of his consciousness that was gradually getting clearer, Shidou noticed his hands were handcuffed behind him and he was sitting on a chair. What's more in a polite manner, he was fastened to the chair with a rope around the torso, and incidentally, the legs of the chair were fixed into the ground. It was a persistent handiwork that gave him the impression that they did not want to let Shidou out no matter what happens. "What the heck is this………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, he was not blindfolded or gagged. After Shidou grumbled, he slowly turned his head and looked around the place that he was in.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the corner of a dark, abandoned building. There were cracks on the wall and a part of the ceiling was damaged, exposing the steel frame. It was giving off an aura that this place was away from human hands for a very long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just why was he captured in a place like this? Shidou twisted his head at that basic question------and immediately, he recalled the events that occurred before he fainted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah, I was chasing after Origami…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Shidou said that, the door in front of him opened with a *giii* sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked over there as he got attracted by the sound, he noticed Origami carrying a huge Boston bag and was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami! What are you doing-----" Shidou said that before gasping.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me you really joined DEM…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami approached Shidou silently, she put the Boston bag on the floor and started looking inside of it. "Wh-what are you…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no clue what she was going to bring out but, if Origami has really involved herself with the DEM then,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou will probably be in some kind of trouble. A gun, knife, or maybe truth serum………..various ideas flew into Shidou's mind instantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, "-----here"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Shidou's predictions, the object Origami brought out was a PET bottle filled with mineral water.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-what's this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Water. You're thirsty right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Within this extremely weird situation, Origami asked him in an extremely normal manner. Shidou raised his eyebrows in reflex from that odd feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that his lips were dry but, he was hesitant to simply drink something given to him by the person that kidnapped him. He sent a suspicious gaze to Origami who was handing him water.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Origami noticed Shidou's feelings, she opened the PET bottle and *Gulp*, took a sip and drank the water inside the bottle to show him……….it seems she was telling him that there was no poison or anything similar inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No. He was wrong. Origami drank the water without swallowing and brought her lips closer to Shidou's lips like that. Yes. It was like…………she was going to transfer the water to his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Stop! I get it! I'll take it! I'll take it so let me drink it normally!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Shidou's words, Origami swallowed the water and said that with a slightly disappointed expression. She then handed over the opened PET bottle to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-aahh, then slowly-----Muguuuf!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without hearing the end of Shidou's words, Origami shoved the PET bottle into Shidou's mouth. It was a forceful indirect kiss. He could not fight back since it was pushed towards him suddenly and he drank the water poured into his mouth like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming that he drank the water, Origami pulled her hands back in satisfaction. And for some reason, she licked the mouth of the PET bottle before putting the lid back on.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was curious about that action but……………well, forget it. He coughed violently as if he was choking before, looking back at Origami again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………so for starters, can you let me go"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't do that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami replied back bluntly even though Shidou said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that reaction was within his expectations. Shidou slightly rocked his body and continued talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah---……I get it I get it. Then can you at least unravel the rope one time, and let me bring my handcuffed hands forward?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. Please stay that way a little longer"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please. I have the urge to go to the toilet from just now. Even you don't want me to leak here right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said that, Origami silently crouched down and looked into the Boston bag before taking a PET bottle out from inside again.</p>
<p class="null-p">For an instant, he thought she was going to make him drink water again even though he said he wanted to go toilet but----he was wrong. Shidou felt something was off immediately. There was no content in the PET bottle Origami was holding.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami opened the lid of the PET bottle while approaching Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-oi…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Shidou said that with sweat flowing down his cheeks, Origami did not stop. She placed the PET bottle on the floor before placing her hands on Shidou's belt and *Kacha**Kacha* was opening it while making that sound. "Gyaaaaaaaaaaa! Gyaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having guessed what Origami was thinking about, he twisted his body while rocking the chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey! Its okay like I thought! It's okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou shouted, Origami looked somewhat disappointed while re-tying his belt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa………Haa……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou took a deep breath after breathing heavily and------calmed his heartbeat before looking back at Origami. There was a mountains worth of things he wanted to say but……..now isn't the time for that. Shidou continued talking in a soft tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Are you in DEM now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes" Origami replied back in a calm manner. Shidou got let-down at her acting as if all this was nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes………wait, you should know what that place is right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A rough idea"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----To get power" "Power……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou brought his eyebrows closer, Origami started talking blandly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to her continuous pile up of disobeying orders, they finally decided to discipline Origami. And----in order to continue being a Wizard, there was no other way but to join the DEM.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so…..it's too dangerous!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had no choice.-----There is no other way to gain power to defeat the Spirits"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a quiet…….a shockingly quiet tone, Origami moved her lips. Shidou could not make up any words after seeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely, Origami has a clearer picture of the company called DEM industries than Shidou. She probably knows about agony and suffering that Shidou could only think of since a long time ago. On top of that-----she chose this current situation. It wasn't rejection. It wasn't retaliation. Shidou just felt a type of shiver when he heard Origami's bland voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he can't go down like this. Shidou coughed to regain his composure and moved his mouth again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Then, kidnapping me was-----that Westcott's orders? Just what are you going to do with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Origami slowly swung her head side-ways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was my decision to bring Shidou here. This matter is totally unrelated to DEM Company"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's face was smeared with bewilderment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean? Then why are you doing this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Personally, it was not my intentions to take your freedom away. I feel apologetic for this"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked away before continuing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was an unavoidable procedure. In order to avoid dragging you into this, this was the most assuring method"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa-wait a second. What are you saying? In order to avoid dragging me in………? What the hell is that about!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami clenched her fist as if she was renewing her determination when he asked before opening her lips. "----It's the fight between me and the Spirits"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes wide in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sp-spirits……and, who are they"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spirits are Spirits. Of course----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami stopped her words for a moment and took a light breath before continuing on. "----Yatogami Tohka and the rest are no exemptions"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….uh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped. Even though it was just a few moments since he drank water, his throat was oddly dry. *Dokun**dokun* his heartbeat started becoming harder and it made him feel as if his whole body was shaking. Fighting with Spirits. And----Killing the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thinks about, these were the words Origami was saying ever since he first met her. She was an AST member that has a goal in defeating the Spirits so, this was normal. Of course, Shidou has heard those words countless times already.</p>
<p class="null-p">But----why.</p>
<p class="null-p">He never would have imagined his heart would be this painful even though those were words he was used to hearing. "Wai-wait Origami! Your target is the Spirit that killed your parents 5 years ago right!? Tohka and the girls are not related in this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----They are still spirits. They are dangerous. In order to avoid making people like me ever again, their existence cannot be forgiven"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……….! Tohka and the rest shouldn't have any spirit readings on them now! You can't target them in that condition, you said-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the policy the higher ups in the JGSDF gave. That's also not my problem anymore now that I am out of the AST"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou groaned while puckering his face. It's just as he says. Origami said she was obeying orders from the higher ups reluctantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thinks about it, Origami's actions were no different from the start. She hates Spirits, detests Spirit, and wants to kill the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-------it can't be helped for Shidou to think that those actions were very warped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the factor of Shidou not wanting Origami and the Spirits to fight was big. However, even if he takes that point away, he still feels an odd feeling coming from Origami's words. Shidou somehow managed to restrain his feelings for shouting and talked in a very calm tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….Hey, Origami. It's already more than half a year since Tohka transferred into our school right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Origami was looking back at Shidou. Shidou felt that her gaze was a little different from not understanding what he was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Time sure flies huh. The Spirits that you were fighting with have mixed into this world you know? Of course Tohka wasn't the only one. Yoshino, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Natsumi, and naturally Kotori and Miku too………..everyone is living as [Humans]"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said it as if he was urging her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami……………are you going to say nothing changed after seeing them for this long? The Spirits are only Spirits…………..are you going to say they have to be killed because their existence are dangerous…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami twitched her eyebrows for the first time, when Shidou said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then slowly walked to the corner of the room and raised her right hand before *gaa*! She punched the wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….I know that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Ori……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yatogami Tohka and the other Spirits are still spirits, and that didn't change. They are my target for revenge.--------that was supposed to be the case"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami said that in a slightly trembling voice, she continued her monologue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I could not forgive myself for slowly changing my recognition after spending time with them. 5 years ago on that day, I should have vowed to have my revenge on the Spirits and yet, I got scared…………for getting used to this situation"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Origami punched the wall once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The reason why I joined DEM was not only because of the AST's disciplinary punishment. Before I could notice this situation-------I started forgiving the days with Yatogami Tohka in it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes wide and cramped his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why------why is that wrong! You should know that too! Tohka and the rest just want to live a normal life!" "………no. I can't forgive that. As long as they are Spirits"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami separated her fist from the wall before turning her back to Shidou in a relaxed state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Spirits aren't the only thing I am going to kill. I am going to kill the me who formed a connection to them before I knew it. With Yatogami Tohka's life-----I will regain myself"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Origami left the room. *Batann* the door closed together with that sound, and fragments from a part of the wall fell off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait! Origami! Please wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou twisted his body while shouting desperately. But the restraints that she put on carefully would not come off easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he could not give up because of that. If this goes on, the fight between Origami and the girls cannot be avoided.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn…….! Origami! Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou used all his strength to shake his body and shouted until his throat was close to breaking.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------Is it okay, Ike. To let her move by her own judgment"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the highest suite room of a hotel located in east Tenguu, Ellen Mira Mathers spoke in a quiet tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a characteristic girl with light Nordic blonde hair, blue eyes, snow white skin and a slender body. However, the atmosphere of her outward features were not giving off the feeling of a fleeting sheltered lady, but rather it was the atmosphere of a veteran soldier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the man sitting opposite of Ellen did not get swallowed up by her atmosphere and replied back in a relaxed manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's true that I plan to look at the situation for a while but, she finally decided to do something. There is no need to discourage our young Wizard right.-----well, that just happened recently anyways. The bribe needed for the JGSDF became larger than usual"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a young man around his mid-thirties. He has dark ash blonde hair and blade-sharp eyes. His eyes filled with darkness could make the people facing him feel an indescribable anxiety.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sir Isaac Rey Peram Westcott. He was the managing director of the huge world famous company, DEM industries.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You mean that…..huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen turned slightly discouraged when she heard Westcott's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, it was only natural. That's because a few days ago, both Westcott and Ellen were close to having an artificial satellite fall onto their heads by the hands of DEM Company's Board of directors.</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation somehow got resolved and all the board members including the mastermind- Roger Murdoch were arrested but…………..Ellen was still feeling unsatisfied because she was not given any specific orders by Westcott on how to punish them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe he guessed what she was thinking, Westcott purposely shrugged his shoulders and continued talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, I have no plans to overturn the plan we've been going through until now.-----however, it's also true that I want the data that occurs in various cases. We have that many Spirits gathered there. It's possible to turn one or two of them into Sephira crystals"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Westcott made his mouth turn into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, It's about time I want <Mordred>'s battle data. Our target is still the Spirit. Shooting down a dropping bomb is not enough to measure its true strength.-----You want to see how amazing she is too right? Well, if she brings out a</p>
<p class="null-p">power more than our expectations then-------we might have to stop her before she kills off all the Spirits" Westcott looked back at Ellen while continuing on. Ellen made a small sigh while nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just as Westcott says. Ellen also wanted to grasp the ability of that girl----Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although there were records of her data and AST battle records, it was to the end something recorded with her using the official equipment's provided by the AST. She wants to know how strong is Origami when she fights the Spirits using the DEM industries latest CR-unit <Mordred>----the sister unit of Ellen's <Pendragon>. That's because, she scouted her to support her for the missions that are going to come. "Understood. I will work behind the scenes this time"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ellen said that, Westcott giggled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You look unsatisfied"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No that is not true"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whenever you lie, your eyebrows will go closer so I understood immediately"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">She immediately touched the space between her eyebrows with her right hand. But…………..there wasn't really any wrinkles formed there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott smiled happily when he saw Ellen do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen put her hand back to its usual spot and this time, she made an obvious unpleasant face while looking at Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, don't get looks so angry, my cute little Ellen.-----I want you to handle a different target this time" "….Different target?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Ellen asked dubiously, Westcott [Yes] nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Tobiichi Origami targets <Princess>and the rest, a hindrance will definitely disturb them" Ellen twitched her cheeks when she heard Westcott's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------<Ratatoskr>"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly"</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the Spirits in this city did not gather by just some kind of coincidence. It was because they were under the protection of the organization that protects Spirits----<Ratatoskr organization>.</p>
<p class="null-p">And they know that <Ratatoskr>has an airship that protects and observes the Spirits, handles the Space quakes, and also it has the power to oppose DEM whose goal is to destroy/capture Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Tobiichi Origami targets the spirits then, there was no mistake that they will interrupt her. What's more,</p>
<p class="null-p"><Ratatoskr>currently has Takamiya Mana the DEM Company's previous number 2 with them. If she appears then, Origami might not have the chance to target the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, you want me to handle Mana?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott slowly swung his head when Ellen asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noo"</p>
<p class="null-p">"? Then who"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I contacted HQ yesterday-----I told them to send <Goetia>here"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!!</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen opened her eyes wide when she heard Westcott's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">She immediately understood Westcott's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------Are you telling me to stop the <Ratatoskr>ship?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It helps that you understand fast"</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott raised the edge of his lips and smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fight on Arubi island, the fight at the Japan branch company, and also the matter with the artificial satellite---</p>
<p class="null-p">--behind all those events, <Ratatoskr>'s airship was involved in. There is no mistake for this time too, that ship will butt in too. Well………….I might have to express my thanks to them regarding the last matter though"</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott said that while shrugging his shoulders in a joking manner. But Ellen replied back with her expression still not changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------Is it really okay? I can't hold back if I use <Goetia>. It won't end with me slowing them down"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. I leave this matter to you. Handle it as you see fit. If it falls because of something like that then, it means that it's the end of their ship"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen replied with a deep nod after hearing Westcott's words.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">The school without Shidou ended and it was after school. The clear sky during the morning was now cloudy as if it was going to rain any second now. Maybe it was an assist to the sunset, the surroundings was already dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under that sky, Tohka and the Yamai sisters from the neighboring class were walking towards the mansion beside the Itsuka house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun, but Shidou really is weak huh, for heading back early. Looks like I have to train him a bit"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. He is really weak. It is decided that he will be running starting tomorrow"</p>
<p class="null-p">From behind, Kaguya and Yuzuru's voice could be heard in order. While walking, Tohka looked behind her and saw two identical girls standing beside each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the right, the girl was making a face filled with confidence-Yamai Kaguya while on the left; the girl was making a sleepy face-Yamai Yuzuru. They are twin Spirits that were hard to distinguish if someone took a quick look at them but……...it is possible to distinguish them by their obvious body structure if they slightly lower their sights. "Please don't say that. Shidou must have some kind of reason" After Tohka said that, Kaguya and Yuzuru shrugged their shoulders at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka, I know that. It's just a joke. Well, it's the truth that I am thinking of training him a little though"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Now that I think back, I heard master Origami transferred schools. Is Shidou going back early related to that?" Yuzuru asked while tilting her head. Tohka brought her eyebrows closer in a troubled manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu…………..It's true that Shidou disappeared right after he heard that she transferred. It might be related" Kaguya and Yuzuru both *Fufuun* snorted after hearing Tohka's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku……..Just like I thought. This certainly is suspicious"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. It smells of a scheme"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Suspicious? It doesn't smell anything like flour [5]?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I don't mean that…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya scratched her cheeks while sweat was flowing down her forehead, when Tohka said that while tilting her head. For some reason, Kaguya's voice tone would sometimes change.</p>
<p class="null-p">After walking while having that conversation, the Spirit mansion they live in could be seen not long later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka stopped at that moment. Beside the Mansion----in front of Shidou's house, there was a girl standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a tall girl in a sailor uniform with her bluish purple hair fluttering by the wind. She has meaty proportions like a model and a lovely face. However, that expression now was being clouded in boredom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------ahh"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that girl noticed the girls. The gloomy expression turned bright and she ran towards the girls with both her hands spread out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka-saaaaan, Kaguya-saaaaan, Yuzuru-saaaan"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, Kaguya, Yuzuru felt danger at the same time and dodged from the spot. However, since the girl charged at them without letting off any momentum, she hugged the telephone pole just like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nguh! Moou, why did you dodge it"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, [Puu--] she pouted her lips and while maintaining the posture of a koala hanging onto a tree, the girl let out an unsatisfied voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a beautiful voice which sounded like a clear bell. But it isn't any surprise at all; she's currently Japan's most popular top idol while at the same time a student of Rindouji girl academy; she was called Izayoi Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, before that, why did you charge at us!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh? It's obviously a hug. It's a display of my affection"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka asked her with a shout and Miku replied back as if it was normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-is that so……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Everyone does it. Come on, Tohka-chan too"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Miku left the telephone pole and spread her arms to Tohka. Tohka somehow gradually felt Miku's words were true after looking at that open state.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_10.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Mu-muu………."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, both sides of her shoulders got grabbed tightly from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-don't get fooled my kinsman!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Warning. It smells like a lie"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….! I-it's just like I thought!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka immediately twitched her shoulders and stopped. Miku made her eyebrows look like a 八 in disappointment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaaahn, no waaay. You don't have to worry; I will give Kaguya and Yuzuru a good strong hug too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't ask for that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shudder. My chastity is in danger"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru hugged their own shoulders and backed off. Miku *Ahaha* laughed after looking at them like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu………by the way Miku, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka asked her, Miku blinked her eyes in surprise before hitting her hand as if she recalled something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes oh yes! That's right, I came here to darling's place to play after school ended but, no one was here and that made me bored. I tried going to the mansion next door but, it seems everyone was out"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku said that in a bored manner. Tohka and the Yamai sisters looked at each other when she heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No……..Shidou isn't back yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There was no reply even though I pressed the chime many times. It seems Kotori-chan isn't at home too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Fuun, it might be related with the Origami case"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. There might be something to it"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sisters placed their hands on their chins while talking with each other. Miku pouted her lips again in dissatisfaction again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mouu, explain to me too please! Just what is going on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu-umu……Actually"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka gave a summarized explanation. And in a blink of an eye, several senses of urgency and a curiosity could be sensed coming from Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuumu, It really is suspicious………..A danger might be approaching darling"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Da-danger? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka was sweating from those unrestful words and Miku made one finger stand before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Try thinking about it. First off, there is no mistake that darling went back early from school because he went to find</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami-san's whereabouts right? And, he isn't back home in this late hour would mean………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….? Doesn't that mean he hasn't find Tobiichi Origami yet?" Miku swung her head at Tohka's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that's the case, then he would at least contact us. Which means…………it's just that. If darling got captured by Origami instead then, there might be a possibility that he is getting licked all over now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">All three of them opened their eyes wide. Impossible-----Shidou is currently being!?</p>
<p class="null-p">But, judging by Origami's daily behavior, it can't be passed off as a simple joke. The three of them shuddered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't stay here! Let's hurry and find darling!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Miku raised her fist up energetically. Tohka and the Yamai sisters too, [Oooh!] raised their right fists as if to continue with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">---UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-------------</p>
<p class="null-p">A very loud siren echoed through the area.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu, this is…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Space quake alarm……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku made a bitter face while mumbling.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she had no choice but to do so. The alarm ringing would mean that, the search for Shidou has to be stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">A space quake, just like its name says, is an earthquake occurring on space. It's a disaster that occurs unexpectedly------and the reason for it was the appearance of Spirits like the Tohka and girls, although the facts were not announced to the public.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu……..so this is the appearance of a new Spirit huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Interested. I wonder what kind of Spirit it is"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sisters stroke their chins while saying it in deep interest. However, Miku swung her head as if to warn them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't, both of you. If the space quake alarm sounds then, you have to evacuate to the shelter"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…..i-I know that. I just wanted to say that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Disappointed. We have no choice. Let's evacuate"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru nodded bitterly and headed towards the nearest shelter in the area.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-muu……….but Shidou is………."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Tohka brought her eyebrows closer in a troubled manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">They have to evacuate when the alarm rings. She knows that. But, Shidou might be in some kind of crisis. Origami might have finished licking him if she waited for the space quake to settle down. Tohka was troubled and did not move from the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----there is no need for that"</p>
<p class="null-p">A quiet voice came from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu………….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka turned around dubiously----and opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, the person called Tobiichi Origami who she just found out transferred schools this morning was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tobiichi Origami……..? What are you doing here"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Houu? To think you would appear by your own will. Did you realize that it's useless to hide and run from my magic eye?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wonder. Master Origami. Is it true that you transferred?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, Origami-san. Isn't darling with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………….." Even though everyone opened their mouth, Origami did not reply to any of them. She just silently------looked at them with a freezing-cold glare. While bringing her eyebrows closer and looking at that glare, Tohka opened her mouth again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..so, what do you mean by not needing to evacuate?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The space quake won't occur"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka wrung her neck after hearing Origami's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't this a space quake alarm? Everyone is evacuating you know"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Tohka spread her arms to show Origami the surrounding state. The residents quickly jumped out from their houses when they heard the space quake alarm and headed towards the nearest shelter.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami silently-------(as if she was waiting for the nearby residents to get away from the place)-----continued staring at Tohka and the rest before finally opening her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This alarm was ringed by my request. Actually, neither Spirits nor AST will appear"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say…………..? Why did you do such a-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka asked again, Origami looked at the girls in order once more and took a deep breath to calm her heart before taking out a dog tag from her pocket and lightly placing it on her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----To defeat you all here"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, Origami's body gave off a pale light and her body was wearing the Wizard armor----the CR-unit. It had dark grey composition and a sharp form. It had deployed X shaped thrusters and the giant equipment's loaded on her hips were characteristic.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not the AST official equipment that Origami usually wears. Although the weapon types were different, it closely resembles the unit the DEM industries Wizard-Ellen Mathers uses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She let out a surprised voice at Origami's sudden actions. However, Origami did not bother about that and swung her right hand forward. And as if to match that action, the weapons equipped on her hips transformed, deployed and was being held on Origami's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a huge Maryoku cannon as big as Origami. After Origami prepared that with one hand, she pulled the trigger without any hesitation at all. Just when an eye-glaring light appeared in the cannon, an enormous Maryoku torrent came out from it and headed towards the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh------"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka gasped, she immediately carried Miku and jumped towards the left. And at the same timing, the Yamai sisters kicked the ground and jumped upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, the place the girls were standing just now got erased by Origami's maryoku cannon. The asphalt ground and concrete wall were the victims. All of them got blown away by a straight line from Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">If they were to jump away a few seconds later then, the girls would probably be erased like the wall. Tohka took a glance at the tip of her hair that touched the attack and glared at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-what are you doing all of a sudden! Isn't that dangerous!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you already. I will defeat you----Spirits"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that in a cold voice, Origami pointed the cannon to Tohka and Miku. There was neither doubt nor hesitation in her eyes at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Different from the usual Origami, her sights were painted with pure hostility and killing intent. Tohka gulped looking at her weird state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">No-----it's different. Tohka clenched her teeth as if to recall back. Tohka has seen this Origami before.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was over half a year ago. Before Tohka met Shidou, the AST Tobiichi Origami that would attack her each time</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka appeared in this world would show the same kind of eyes like now. The girl that hates the Spirits, detest the Spirits and had her whole existence devoted into killing Spirits. The current Origami was just like her previous self.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. She did not notice until now since she usually sees her in school but, Origami clearly has changed in the past half of the year. Of course, Shidou's existence played an important role for that but-------it was quiet but gradual that her hatred towards Tohka and the Yamai sisters was different from when she first met her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why--------why did you turn back, Tobiichi Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami did not care even though Tohka shouted. She remained silent and pulled the trigger again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was too late even though she jumped away while carrying Miku again. Origami's finger moved faster than Tohka's movements by one tempo.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at that moment, the cannon pointed to Tohka suddenly moved upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was immediately identified. The Yamai Sisters that jumped upwards from the cannon attack just now manifested their Limit Astral Dress and attacked Origami from the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The dense light of Maryoku was shot towards the sky. However, the Yamai sisters twisted their bodies mid-air and dodged it by a paper thin difference.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kukuh, good job noticing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Admiration. As expected from Master Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru performed a somersault before descending down in front of Origami as if to protect Tohka and Miku. They then took a cool pose while, pointing the Angel in their hand <Raphiel>towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, I'll listen to your excuse just in case, Origami. This is too much for a joke, no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Interrogate. Please answer us Master Origami. I don't want to fight you" "There is no need to answer"</p>
<p class="null-p">Faster than her words, Origami converted the Maryoku cannon and manifested a huge blade formed from Maryoku on the tip of the cannon. She then prepared that laser blade and charged towards the Yamai sisters. She most likely bounced her body by using the Territory; it was an acceleration with no useless actions. If it was a normal opponent then, they would probably be cut down before even responding to her moves.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the opponent Origami was dealing with now was the Yamai sisters known for being the Spirits with the highest mobility. After dodging that attack both of them, started crossing weapons with Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the battle situation couldn't be said to be good. The Yamai sister's movements were probably obstructed by Origami's spread out Territory. Not long later, Origami started pushing both of them back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh----Miku, we are going to save those two!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sisters were in danger at this rate. The moment she thought that, light started covering Tohka's body and it took the form of her Astral Dress.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_11.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"<Sandalphon>…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She shouted and thrust her right hand forward. Light particles gathered from nowhere when she did that and Tohka's Angel manifested. It was <Sandalphon>. The strongest sword that was able to cut through anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, several pipes appeared around Origami and sound started producing near them. ----it was Miku. Just like Tohka and the Yamai sisters, Miku manifested her limit Astral dress and Angel- <Gabriel>and started making an elegant song by playing her light keyboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Gabriel>----[Rondo]!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami slightly frowned her eyebrows. The [Sound] produced by Miku's angel-<Gabriel>was restraining Origami's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had no intention of killing Origami. But, it was also fact that they can't have a normal conversation like this. After Tohka exchanged sights with the Yamai sisters up in the sky, they matched their timing and flew towards Origami from 3 directions at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She swung <Sandalpon>at Origami. At the same time, Kaguya's lance approached her from the upper right while Yuruzu's pendulum approached her from the upper left.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no place to run, it was in perfect timing. No matter if Origami was wearing the DEM equipment's, there was no way she would run off un-scattered if she takes on the attack of three Angels at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Haa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The pipes surrounding Origami in a radius got blown away the moment Origami made a strong shout. At the same time, Tohka felt the hallucination as if she got grabbed by an invisible hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She remembers this feeling. Yes, this was a super dense Territory------it's quite similar to the move Ellen Mathers used to capture her. As if she got thrown into very thick mud, she could not move her limbs as she liked and it became hard to breathe.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, this feeling won't last that long. Turning it into time, it will last probably around 3 seconds. However, the girls' position switched with Origami's within that small 3 seconds. "---------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami put Maryoku inside the laser blade and slashed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuhah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regret. Uguh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they managed to barely block her blade, they could not kill off the impact force. Tohka, Kaguya and Yuzuru let out painful groans before getting blown away in 3 different directions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"*cough*…………*cough*……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ev-everyone! Are you all okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku's worried voice echoed from behind. But, Tohka could not reply back to her. The reason was simple. Origami who blew them all away was sending a sharp glare at her without lowering her guard down.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she looks away for an instant, her head will probably fly up to the sky in that instant. Tohka could not feel that this was a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Origami was seriously trying to kill the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">The words Origami chanted just now has finally sunk into her body. And now, Origami gained the power to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Lets settle things by knocking her out? Hold back my strength to the point that I can't kill her and listen to her? She became aware of how naïve her thoughts were a few minutes ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now in front of her was the strongest enemy who has power worthy of her will of destruction. I have to kill her----or I will be killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was her battlefield common sense she should have thrown away half a year ago. That cold feeling pierced Tohka's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Tohka gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was aware of that, Tohka did not have the will to kill Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Origami wasn't the only one that changed in this period of half a year. Tohka finally noticed this now. During the perioot that she had spent time with her, her hatred and hostility to Origami had turned into something else compared to the first time she met her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----What are you doing, Tohka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She twitched her shoulders when she suddenly heard Kaguya's voice.-----During the time Tohka was thinking, Origami took this chance to close in right in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku-ah…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A merciless attack struck Tohka. Her armor which was supposed to be absolute got cut apart and blood scattered around.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">"Space quake alarm….!? Is there a Reiha nearby?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the bridge of the air ship <Fraxinus>floating up 15,000 meters above Tenguu city, Kotori with a crimson jacket on her shoulders raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when she was finding Shidou's whereabouts from <Fraxinus>, the Tenguu city space quake alarm suddenly echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-There is no Reiha standing out in the area!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Operating the detection device at the lower bridge Minowa raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori frowned from the expected reply. There was no way <Fraxinus>loaded with the world's highest class Reiha detection device would fall behind the JGSDF. Then just what was----</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is a……false alarm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….No, it might be dangerous to decide that"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person that replied Kotori was a woman with a sleepy expression and splendid thick shades under her eyes. It was <Ratatoskr>Analyst officer and Kotori's best friend, Murasame Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Try recalling back. A few months ago, a space quake alarm like now was issued during the time Shin infiltrated the DEM Japan branch too"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori twitched her eyebrows after hearing Reine's words. It's true that there is a possibility for DEM, or maybe the JGSDF higher ups to ring the alarm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which means----this is to ward people off? Are they trying to do something so big that they require the residents to evacuate?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….The possibility of that is enough. At the very least, it's more dangerous to think that this was a false alarm" It's just as Reine says. After Kotori made the Chupa Chups she was eating stand, she sent her voice towards the lower bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is urgent; please investigate the situation within the alarm's radius. Take one part of the automated camera searching Shidou to----"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of Kotori's words, an extremely loud alarm echoed in the bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………! What is it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! Thi-this is-----I confirmed a strong Maryoku reading coming from nearby commander's house! Tohka-chan and the others are there too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say? Display it, Hurry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time the crew operated the consoles, the familiar image of her house was shown on the bridge's main monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kotori gasped in fear after looking at that image.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's only normal. That's because, Tohka, the Yamai sisters, and Miku were----confronting in front of the Itsuka house Tobiichi Origami in a DEM CR-unit. "Tobiichi Origami………!? Why is she over there!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She could easily see that Origami was not there for a peaceful conversation. Actually, Origami started attacking the girls immediately when Kotori raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it's a crazy value of Maryoku! It cannot be compared to her previous ones at all! At this rate, the girls not in their complete Astral Dress will……….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kawagoe's shout echoed from the lower bridge. Kotori frowned her face in detest.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't know what happened between Origami and DEM. But, it was also a fact that the girls are now in danger. She raised her right hand forward and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Fraxinus>Maximum speed ahead! We are going to retrieve the girls! If we are in trouble then deploy the <Yggd Folium>and have it support us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time the crew members replied all at once, the motor sound slightly got louder and the bridge shook a little. The <Fraxinus>then changed its course towards Kotori's house and-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, their movements stopped because of a strong impact. "What's going on!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it's an attack from outside! Territory 30 percent down!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..! Enemy sighted at 3 o' clock! This is----an airship!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Kotori shouted, a giant ship's image was shown on the main monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">More specifically--------an empty space distorted and an air ship appeared from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, of course there was no way a giant cluster of iron appeared out of nowhere. It must have deployed a stealth cover just like the <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori lost her words after seeing the ship shown on the monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a ship with the same size as <Fraxinus>and had a fluid exterior. It was a beautiful ship with gold decorations covering everywhere on its silver body.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as there are only 2 companies in the world that can manufacture Realizers, it's most likely a DEM ship but, it had the impression that it was quite different from the last 2 ships Kotori and the group saw until now. But the ship in front of <Fraxinus>right now looked like it was made for high-class personal to ride on and had aspects as if it was prepared for some sort of etiquette.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kotori swung her head to deny her own thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">The airship uses the permanent territory produced by the Realizer to make its huge body to float and it's an existence that should not appear on the [Surface] of history. Even if the ship was decorated like a carriage, it would not be displayed anywhere and even before that problem, no matter how whimsical the DEM company was, there was no way they would use a show-off specialized ship to attack <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it looks unsuitable in this spot------the ship floating in front of them right now, it was an emissary of destruction created with the intentions to destroy by DEM industries.</p>
<p class="null-p">"*Tsk* at a time like this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No………..it was probably because the time was now that they appeared. Kotori clenched her teeth. It was hard to think that a ship would appear around Origami when she appeared in front of the Spirits without any reason. Most likely, they came to a conclusion that Kotori and the group will try to save the girls and prepared the ship in the sky just so that it could obstruct them from doing so.</p>
<p class="null-p">The stealth cover was used to blend into the surroundings by manipulating the Territory but, in order to fully display that function, the ship must stay still on the spot. If it were to sail while maintaining its camouflage, the surrounding scenery would seem distorted, although it was just by a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kotori was biting her teeth in frustration, an alarm echoed suddenly from the speaker. "uh, Just what is it" When Kotori asked, Shiizaki on the lower bridge operated the console----and gasped in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This………is a transmission! We received a transmission line to <Fraxinus>from the concerned ship!" "Transmission………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori brought her eyebrows closer in suspicion and replied back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Link it please"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time with Shiizaki's words, a window was displayed on the monitor and a girl was shown on it. She had light blonde hair and blue eyes to show that she was a westerner. Her absolute confidence in herself could be felt from that elegant expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------This should be our first meeting I think. I thank you for replying to the transmission" The girl said it with fluent Japanese. Kotori unintentionally gasped after seeing the girl. "…………., Ellen Mathers…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The person shown on the screen was the DEM industries 2nd executive Wizard- Ellen Mathers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gasps could be heard coming from the crew's at the lower bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was only natural. That's because the girl being shown now was someone with a body that can take on a Spirit, known as humanity's strongest Wizard and was targeted to be someone they should watch out for the most. Ellen twitched the side of her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you know of me. This is an honor.----Itsuka Kotori"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she said Kotori's name as her reply. It seems the other side has investigated them too. Unlike her elegant appearance, she was a girl that hated to lose. Kotori *Fuun* snorted and glared at Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………yes, you have a problem with it? Is a middle-School kid like me acting as commander bad or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way. Personal abilities are not related to looks or age. To display my respect to you who has been obstructing our plans until now, I will honestly say I do not dislike that way of you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without saying it in a joking manner, Ellen replied back. Unable to grasp any of her plots, Kotori lightly narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you.-----So, what business does the world's strongest Wizard have with us? Is it an invitation for tea time? We are busy now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she said it ironically, Ellen did not move her expression at all. She replied back to Kotori's question in a bland tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have 2 requests-----one. I will give you all 3 minutes so, whoever wants to live please evacuate the ship" "What did you say……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's gaze turned even sharper after Ellen's words and she *Fuun* snorted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, you're saying you are going to shoot this <Fraxinus>down?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't deny that possibility that it might happen. However, <Fraxinus>huh………….Is that the name of</p>
<p class="null-p">thatship. Isee, it'sreally smart to use the world tree's name.---Was Elliot the one whonamed it?" Kotori slightly opened her eyes wider when she heard the name Ellen brought up.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was the founder of <Ratatoskr>and the chairman of the decision-making organization-Rounds, Elliot Baldwin Woodman was his name.</p>
<p class="null-p">But there was something bothering her even more compared to that right now. She made a hateful sigh and glared at the screen with sniping-like eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you a looking down on <Fraxinus>a little too much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"These are my words but, aren't you the ones that's underestimating me? Underestimating the performance of this <Goetia>and----my power"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_12.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">Jest could not be seen from her state as expected. She was seriously saying that. She was seriously saying that her ship would beat this <Fraxinus>---The airship made by the joint effort of all of Asgard electronics techniques.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun………….Then why go all the way and try to decrease my crew numbers? It sounds like you were trying to cut our battle potential by using words because you can't win at this rate you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That isrelated to the otherrequest"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen said it in a calm tone. She was someone impossible to shake. Kotori clicked her tongue in frustration before continuing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Fuuun? So, what is the other request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen made a thin sigh when Kotori said that and took a deep bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The person who manages to escape this fight, I have a messagefor Elliot that Iwant youtosend"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Message?" "Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ellen made a quiet nod------it was the first time her flat voice had emotions in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Elliot. Elliot. You betrayer. You who betrayed our vow. Please prepare yourself. No matter where you hide, I will definitely find you and I will cut off that head of yours"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori gasped in reflex at the stern tone that was unthinkable judging by Ellen's speech until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen coughed before returning to that unconcerned face like just now and looked towards Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is all. ----Well then, I will now give you all 3 minutes from now. Please go ahead and evacuate" "………..You all heard her"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori looked down at the crew on the lower bridge while saying that after hearing Ellen's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our enemy is humanity's strongest. I don't mind if you all want to run"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said it seriously without any hint of joking in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The crew twitched their shoulders for an instant when she said that but however, everyone *Nii* raised the sides of their lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….No way. I wouldn't have come to the Commander's side in the first place if I was going to run "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, is there a difference between death and leaving the commander here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Who the heck is humanity's strongest, let's show her our power"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your orders please, commander. I wrote my will a long time ago"</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-me too, I already set my D-drive at home to delete all of its data when I die……..!" Every member of the crew said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to continue from that, Kannazuki behind the commander seat made a big nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. But well, it's also hard to throw away the chance to get punished by the commander for running away though"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She silently stomped on Kannazuki's foot. [KyaaOO!] A strange voice filled with ecstasy came from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori snorted and made a small sigh before looking back at the screen. "----And there you have it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isthat so. How disappointing"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not showing a disappointed expression, Ellen said that. Kotori swung her hand and sent her orders to the lower bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Parallel activate AR-008, from number 3 to number 6! Initiate Maryoku charge, prepare <Mystletainn>! Target at 3 o' clock! DEM airship----<Goetia>!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if they got bounced by Kotori's voice, the crew members started operating their consoles all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing that response, Ellen narrowed her eyes and sat straight in the chair. No------the shape was a little different from a chair. It looks like a slanted oxygen capsule machine. It either looks like a hibernation device that often appears in movies or maybe, a metallic coffin.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then took out a headset. Although the shape was different, she deployed the same thing that the <Fraxinus>has too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Itsuka Kotori. I thought you're someone with calm judgments. Even though you aren't blood related, you really are Itsuka Shidou's sister" "That is the best compliment" After Kotori said that while snorting, she operated the console near her and forcefully cut the transmission.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Deploy <Yggd Folium>, number 1 to 12!---Kannazuki!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kotori called his name, <Fraxinus>vice commander-Kannazuki Kyouhei standing right behind the commander seat replied back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The opponent is the strongest wizard. Please prepare yourself just in case"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I knew you would say that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki said that. Kotori took a glance behind her and found out Kannazuki was standing there equipped with the headset on his head already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori relaxed her mouth and placed the rod of the Chupa Chups between her fingers before taking it out from her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't keep her company forever! Let's finish this quick and save the girls!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maryoku charge complete, <Mystletainn>is ready to fire!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The enemy ship <Goetia>is not moving!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori clicked her tongue after hearing the crews' words. Even though the fight has begun, the enemy has not taken any actions. And although the deal was off, there was no way the enemy was so carefree to honestly wait for 3 minutes. As long as the opponent was not an idiot------there was no mistake that the enemy was letting them have the first move.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that is the case then they are being looked down upon. Kotori pointed the Chupa Chups at the enemy ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Mystletainn>Fire!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Kotori's voice echoed throughout the ship, a blinding light started to gush out of the cannon prepared in front of <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a giant cluster of Maryoku produced by simultaneous activating the giant Realizers carried in the ship. The light it produces is the light of destruction that will turn anything it touches into dust. The timing was perfect. It was probably impossible to dodge it with the movements of a giant airship.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, as long as the opponent ship is covered in Territory too, Kotori didn't think this hit will end things. It seems the opponent has quite the confidence in her Territory's strength so she was taking provocative action like stopping in mid-air.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, creating the starting point and getting hold of the initiative plays a very important role in airship battles.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is meaning in scraping off the opponents Territory as much as possible and if she focus in defensive Territory in front of the ship to defend against the cannon attack then, they will use the way of turning the <Yggd Folium>they released just now into mines and send it behind the opponent before exploding it.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what it may be, they have to attack from here on. If Ellen was serious in bringing down <Fraxinus>then, bringing her down right in the get go is the only choice after the first unexpected transmission call. ---But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori opened her eyes wide in reflex in the next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment it was about to touch <Mystletainn>'s light, <Goetia>moved to the left with an unbelievable speed and dodged the attack with a paper thin difference.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking normally, that was an impossible path. It was not forward or backwards, it's not even rotating, but directly to the side. It made an unnatural move as it was a chess piece sliding to the next grid on the chess board.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Fumu. It seems the Territory wrapping the ship is quite light and it made it increase its performance. And most likely, the movement just now was done by flicking the ship using the Territory"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that even possible!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is not impossible according to theory. I have never tried it before though. -----As expected from the eternal</p>
<p class="null-p">Mathers huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki stroked his chin and said that. Kotori *Gan* slammed the handrails of the commander seat. "Now isn't the time to be impressed! It's coming!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Kotori shouted, <Goetia>took an unnatural path again while approaching <Fraxinus>. It was a speed unthinkable from an airship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh- Turn the Territory to defensive! Prepare for impact!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, a shot was released from the cannon prepared on the tip of <Goetia>and it touched the Territory covering <Fraxinus>causing Maryoku light fireworks to scatter nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">"*Tsk*…….now she's done it. Set the <Ygdd Foluim>to mine mode! Take off <Goetia>'s back!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They had to counterattack before she goes on the offensive. Kotori sent her orders to the lower bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">The <Yggd Folium>just like its name states are leaf shaped units equipped behind <Fraxinus>. All of them had independent Realizers on and they were an all-purpose weapon that's able to deploy its Territory by remote control from the mother ship. It has an extreme wide range of uses from transmission relays to attacking the enemy. The existence of this weapon is the greatest characteristics of the airship <Fraxinus>made by Asgard Electronics.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rog---- uh…………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However. An irregularity occurred. A very loud alarm echoed in the bridge the moment the crew's reply reached her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……another attack is coming!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant Kotori gasped, a light glittered from <Goetia>'s tip and <Fraxinus>shook tremendously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori clenched her teeth while glaring at the <Goetia>shown on screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">The main armament on the airship was obviously a Maryoku cannons with Maryoku pumped from the Realizer. Although it was equipped with weapons like the machine guns but, it could be said to be useless to use such a thing in an airship battle with Territory's covering the ships.</p>
<p class="null-p">The most important thing now is to scrape off the Territory. If that is achieved then, the choices they have left will be probably increasing the ship's body Territory density or attacking with the Maryoku cannon, leaving the special weapon like <Yggd Folium>out of the equation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, the strategy <Goetia>took was very orthodox. ----leaving that crazy speed aside though.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Another attack from a small 10 second interval from the first attack………!? Impossible, what kind of Realizer is loaded in there……….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. As long as Maryoku is produced by simultaneously activating the Realizers, it was basically impossible to fire the main cannon continuously. Even for <Fraxinus>, it requires at least 30 seconds for the next shot no matter how much they rush.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then increasing the number of Realizers for Maryoku production…………that seems unlikely. Simply just by increasing the generated amount would only cause the processing ability to reach its limits. There has to be an effective way to use it or------</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..*tsk*"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori clicked her tongue in detest. The ship had weird motoring moves. Continuous fire of the Maryoku cannon. All of that connected to the moment she saw Ellen Mathers just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the performance gaps were closed in by the appearance of the new model Realizer called <Ashcroft-Beta>, <Ratatoskr>'s technology was probably still higher.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is why the DEM Company came to fill the performance gap with a different approach.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like <Fraxinus>they included the plan for a processing ability using the human brain in the first draft and instead using it during emergency processing, it was made as a pure [Battleship] designed with effective uses.</p>
<p class="null-p">This cheat was only possible because of Ellen- humanity's strongest Wizard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course the burden to the brain cannot be compared to a normal CR-unit. Most likely, long period sailing was impossible even for Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at this moment, the ship in front of <Fraxinus>was not a slow airship that requires several people to steer but rather------it was [Ellen Mathers] in a huge CR-unit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Commander! The left wing Territory has reached its limits!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"*Tsk*…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori brought her eyes to her personal monitor. It's true that a part of the Territory has suffered serious damage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reactivate the Territory! Hurry with the <Mystletainn>recharge!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-understood!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Kannazuki!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki understood Kotori's intentions and sharpens his sights. In an instant, the <Yggd folium>soared in the sky with tremendous speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one controlling the <Ygdd Folium>now was not the remote control Realizer in <Fraxinus>. It was vice commander Kannazuki standing behind the Commander's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The <Yggd Folium>danced up in the sky and deployed around <Goetia>. All of them then used the Territory they produced and increased their radius with them at the center. Yes. It made up a [cage] around <Goetia>in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Commander, now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, <Mystletainn>--Fire!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shouted after pointing the Chupa Chups at <Goetia>. As if to respond to that voice, the fully charged Maryoku convergence cannon <Mystletainn>made a line of light in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">A Maryoku cannon in front. However, even if she was able to dodge that, the <Yggd Folium>in mine mode was waiting for her. Even <Goetia>can't get away from this one.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the moment <Mystletainn>was fired, <Goetia>charged straight towards the attack and tilted itself the moment it was going to touch the attack, the upper part of the ship then grazed on the <Yggd Folium>'s Territory while dodging <Mystletainn>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What……..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the <Yggd Folium>in mine mode detected the impact and caused a huge explosion but------<Goetia>was still going strong. She most likely focused the Territory covering the ship into one point and withstood the explosion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is that woman's heart made of………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori clenched her teeth in detest. If she were to mess up the controls for even a little then she would probably be blown to bits; it was a very risky plan. If she had a normal head then, she would specialize the defensive Territory to the direction of the attack and withstand the attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually, the moment Kotori saw the opponent took those actions, she had no intentions of ordering a follow-up attack by the <Yggd Folium>. It seems Ellen won this prediction battle because her tactics were better. Ellen took a dangerous bet because she predicted Kotori's plan------</p>
<p class="null-p">"*Tsk*………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori frowned her face knowing that Ellen thought that far ahead.</p>
<p class="null-p">It can't be helped to think that Ellen did not think that her previous action was even a bet. It was just simply because of [There is no way I cannot achieve that] an arrogant thought and she felt that it was only natural to dodge the cannon attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! <Goetia>incoming!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikimoto from the lower bridge raised a shout. Having dodged <Mystletainn>, the <Goetia>was charging at them in a straight line.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, evasive-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please relax, commander"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki with his headset on stepped forth to stand beside the commander seat and *Pachin* snapped his fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, the <Mystletainn>attack that was supposed to be dodged by <Goetia>, diverted its direction towards <Goetia>'s back and returned back to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not know what happened for an instant but, she understood it immediately right after.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were countless <Yggd Folium>with its Territory deployed floating behind <Goetia>. He controlled all of their Territory and forcefully made the Maryoku cannon attack bends its course.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that this was out of her predictions. <Mystletainn>burst behind the unguarded <Goetia>and an explosion occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. If the enemy was a monster then they had a monster too as well. Kotori looked up at the tall man standing beside the commander seat while making a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………As expected from you, Kannazuki"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel obliged. We can't have her damage this beautiful world tree. And------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Commander, I think attacking is more wonderful than getting attacked!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki clenched his fist while shouting. Kotori *Haa* sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..! Commander! The <Goetia>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori twitched her shoulders when she heard Nakatsugawa's shout.</p>
<p class="null-p">---<Goetia>which supposed to have taken a direct hit by <Mystletainn>was currently rushing madly towards <Fraxinus>bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha………….!"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Goetia>converged its Maryoku and fired.</p>
<p class="null-p">A blinding light filled the monitor on the <Fraxinus>bridge.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: Angel</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning back to 10 minutes ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the abandoned building, Shidou was struggling desperately while stuck on the chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, Get off…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he hit the chair with his arms, the metal handcuffs would not break because of that. Similarly, the chair fix to the floor with a rivet, also did not move at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it………… I shouldn't be doing this at a time like this……! Origami! Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he shouted, there was no one that would respond to his call. He could only hear his voice bounce back hopelessly from the wall while frowning his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no clue where this abandoned building was located but, there was no completely no presence of anyone nearby. The only thing he could hear was the creaking door moved by the wind and sometimes the sound of car horns from far away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, this was only something natural. That's because, this was the confinement place that Origami picked. It should be somewhere hard for anyone to find.</p>
<p class="null-p">But…………finding out what that meant only brought forth despair for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having spent a long time with Origami, he could understand her train of thoughts. There was no way she would pick a place like [A place where no one will ever pass-by] to confine Shidou in.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. By any chance that Origami was the only one to know this place then; there exists no one to save Shidou if anything happens to Origami by any chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there was a possibility that a program was prepared to send a mail of Shidou's location to the police or school after some time passed. But, with a minimum insurance, Origami probably took consideration of someone at least passing by this area once every 2 or 3 days so that Shidou won't starve to death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially for this situation, Origami did this so that Shidou won't get dragged into her fight with the Spirits. There wasn't any problem for her if Shidou was stuck here for the whole day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then------there might be a chance [someone] that passes by here once every 2 or 3 days would appear. Placing his bet on that small possibility, Shidou continued shouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyone! Is there anyone here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He can't trust the current Origami. He didn't care about his thirsty throat and continued shouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">However no matter how much he shouted, the only thing he could hear was his echoed back voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh………"</p>
<p class="null-p">At least it would be nice if he could contact someone but naturally, his phone was confiscated by Origami. Kotori and the rest would probably look for Shidou if they don't know where he was but, it will be too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn, what should I…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened the moment Shidou shook his body violently even though he knew it was futile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes wide when he heard another creak other than the chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stopped moving and focused his ears. When he did that, he found out there were soft footsteps echoing from the other side of the door in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..! I-is anyone there!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was help from the heavens. Shidou raised his voice to avoid losing this chance. The footsteps slowly got closer as if the person noticed his voice and stopped right in front of the room door that Shidou was trapped inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing the person opening the door while creaks could be heard from the rusty joints, Shidou's relaxed expression was again controlled by nervousness again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Origami…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The person there was the culprit that confined Shidou here. It was Miss Tobiichi Origami that left the area just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami opened the door, she walked to Shidou silently. Shidou was surprised for an instant but, he immediately swung his head to regain his composure. "Origami----you came back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami did not say anything even though he asked her. She walked to him without changing her pace and stood right in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou frowned his eyebrows at the un-talkative Origami----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, you------"</p>
<p class="null-p">He gasped at the sudden possibility that scratched his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, Shidou thought Origami reconsidered her thoughts half-way and decided to come back to Shidou but………that was a selfish thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, thinking calmly, that was a very naïve hopeful view for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The girl-Tobiichi Origami had a stronger determination than anyone else and there was no way she would change her mind without any reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then why did she come back?</p>
<p class="null-p">There were only 2 things he could think off.</p>
<p class="null-p">First, some kind of problem occurred and she had no choice but to come back to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">And another.</p>
<p class="null-p">---She has already finished her goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou gulped, Origami opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, why……are you back here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami did not answer. She remain silent and only stared at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's breathing slowly turned wild when he saw her unreadable robotic expression. His heartbeat turned rough and his voice turned very dry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no way, you…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said it with a terrified voice, Origami showed a reaction for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it wasn't consent nor was it denial. She only raised the side of her lips silently and----*nii* she made a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Wha-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt that his heart was getting squeezed when he saw that face.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was only natural. That's because the person in front of him was Tobiichi Origami. She seldom changes her expression and that graceful appearance was even enough to be compared with a doll. There were times that she raised her eyebrows or relaxes her cheeks but, he has never seen her make a distinct [smile] like now.</p>
<p class="null-p">That might be true. This was the first time Shidou was able to read Origami's emotion from her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-why……are you smiling………hey, Origami……."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, Origami's smile turned even bigger and her body started trembling as if she could not handle it anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu---------fufu, fufufu" It then slowly got louder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufuu, ahaha-haha…..ahahahahahahahahahahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O……ri, ga….mi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami twisted her body and started laughing. Shidou could only call her name blankly when he saw that weird scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no idea what that laugh meant. But, he unpleasantly found out that the Origami in front of him now was different from usual. His heart was ringing like an alarm bell from that weird scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">---but, he noticed something weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt that Origami……..was laughing too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hii, hiii, hii! What is with that face, what is with that face! Ahahahaha! So weird! So weird! Ah it hurts!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweat was flowing down Shidou's cheek while he closed half of his eyes…………..Origami was holding her stomach while rolling around. Her panties could sometimes be seen from her skirt since she was moving that wildly. It was white.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami was laughing and rolling around, the door that Origami came in just now opened again and a girl entered the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a small girl wearing a casket with cute decorations, and a puppet in her left hand. Shidou raised his voice in reflex when he saw her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yes……are you okay, Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino made a worried face while saying that. As if to match with that, her left hand [Yoshinon] *Clatter**clatter* opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Iyaah, this is one amazing kidnap and confinement. Come on Yoshino, this is a chance you know? you can do anything to Shidou now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino's face turned beet red and she suppressed [Yoshinon]'s mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like he was not curious at [Yoshinon]'s improper comment but, there was no time for that. Shidou shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino, run! The current Origami is weird!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no idea why Yoshino was here. But, he could easily understand how dangerous it is to expose Yoshino to the eyes of Origami who said she was going to kill the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yoshino made big blinks after bringing her sights to Origami who was still rolling around laughing. She then quietly opened her mouth to the weird Origami without being afraid.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err…….I think it's enough………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu-fufu……hi-hiii……..hii………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yoshino said that, Origami finally arranged her breathing and raised her body from the spot. She then flip up her messed up front hair and made a fearless smile before her body started giving off a pale glow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou opened his eyes wide blankly and Origami's silhouette gradually turned smaller------she turned into the appearance of a girl he was familiar with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The person that appeared there was the Spirit Natsumi in her real appearance ----who came to wake Shidou up this morning. It seems, that Origami just now was Natsumi in her transformation……….No wonder something was off.</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, Shidou made a relieved sigh after knowing that the Origami just now was a fake and that both of them were safe. However, Natsumi might have taken the meaning of the sigh in a wrong way and brought her eyebrows closer while looking at Shidou's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………What, you got a problem? Unsatisfied because I came?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no way at all……..More importantly, why are you two here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, Yoshino and Natsumi looked at each other before opening their mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err……….I was giving a tour of the city for Natsumi-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right when we were doing so, we saw you walking with Origami for some reason. So, Yoshino was curious about it and decided to follow you then-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Na-natsumi-san………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino pulled the sleeves of Natsumi's clothes. Natsumi [Haa] face turned red and she grabbed Yoshino's shirt sleeves too. Both of them were shyly pulling each other's shirt……………it was a weird scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-anyway, you guys are lifesavers! Please, could you take off this handcuffs and rope?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, both of them looked at each other before nodding and went behind Shidou. Both of them then started fiddling with the handcuffs and the knot of the rope to help him get loose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shi-shidou-san……….where is the keys for the handcuffs……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah, the hell is with this rope. On top of being tied in such a complex manner, the knot is hardened with adhesives……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems he underestimated Origami. It's nice that help came but, this doesn't change the situation at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, *Don* Natsumi hit her chest that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have no choice. Leave this to me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Natsumi closed her eyes and silently stood still for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after a few seconds, her expression for some reason started turning painful before she moved her fingers as if she was scratching her throat and-------she suddenly opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Shut the hell up damn ittttttttt!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi shouted something unknown to him. And the instant she did that, the rope and handcuffs tying Shidou's body gave a pale glow before turning into soft cottons.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thi-this…..!" Shidou brought both his arms forward while opening his eyes in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, how did you get back your Reiryoku"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, Natsumi whipped the sweat on her forehead as if she was tired and *Fuuu* exhaled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn…………Whenever I think of something that would give me a nasty feeling in my mind, I noticed a little of my power comes back. Well, there are only limited things I can do with it though"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nasty feeling………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………yeah. Incidentally just now, i had a scene image of me heading to the toilet during lunch time and having my bento in the toilet cubicle because I had no friends, I then completely forget to lock the door and I accidentally met a girl in my class when the door opened"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah……..that's just embarrassing"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….And when I got back to class, I noticed everyone was laughing while looking at my direction. Ehh, seriously? So things like that really happen. Ehh, isn't that dirty?" "STOP!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou covered his ears and shouted in reflex at that sad scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">But immediately, he recalled that now wasn't the time to be doing that. He took off the cotton curled around his body and wrist before standing up from the chair. His muscles were aching because his body was stuck in the same position for too long.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, he has to head towards the girls now. The worst case scenario, was that Origami has already come in contact with the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou [Ah] let out his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh yeah……! Both of you, can I borrow your cellphone if you have it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah, yes, here"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Yoshino took her blue cellphone out from her pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying thank you and receiving it, he picked the name Itsuka house (2) from the address record and called.</p>
<p class="null-p">This Itsuka house (2) is actually a code for <Fraxinus>. This number was specially registered into the cellphones given to the Spirits for them to contact Fraxinus if there was an emergency.</p>
<p class="null-p">With this, he could contact <Fraxinus>and use the teleporter to immediately head to the girls. Even in a worst case scenario, he's able to ask Kotori to support the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, instead of the call voice or crew voice coming from the receiver, he could only hear a robotic *duu* *duu* sound from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..What's this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's still okay if it was Kotori answering her personal cellphone but, this was <Fraxinus>exclusive line. He remembered being told to use this connectable special line even if the communication station might be blown off by the space quake.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Did something happen to <Fraxinus>. Shidou's face distorted his face in reflex when anxiety spread out in the reverse side of his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, Shidou-san………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she felt uneasy from his expression; Yoshino said that in a worried manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…….Sorry. Thank you"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Shidou returned Yoshino's cellphone and pointed his toe to the room entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both of you, please! I don't know where this is. Will you all lead me to a place that I am familiar with?-----The others are in danger"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Yoshino and Natsumi made a shocked face but however, they immediately made serious eyes and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu…..Guh…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka raised her body while distorting her face. It seems she was unconscious for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">She found sticky blood on her chest when she touched it. However, it was only natural. That's because her Astral Dress which was supposed to be an absolute armor was mercilessly sliced apart by Origami's laser blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..aah, Tohka-san……you woke up"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka raised her eyebrows while mumbling, she could hear that weak voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">After lifting her face, she saw Miku in a sliced apart limited Astral dress standing up while breathing heavily as if to protect Tohka. There were several bruises and cuts on her white skin; she was literally wounded all over. It was even a mystery that she was able to stand with both her legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku! A-are you okay……..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……….somehow. Tohka-san, it's good to see you're…..oka-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right in the middle of her words, Miku fell to her knees and collapsed. Tohka ran to her quickly and supported her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get a hold of yourself, Miku! Miku!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Miku smiled weakly in response to Tohka's voice, she closed her eyes. At the same time, she lost all her strength in her body and went limp. It looks like she fainted.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment. She could hear the sound of wreckage getting stepped on in the front direction. When she looked over there. She found a death god in dark gray armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tobiichi----Origami……!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She called the girl's name with hatred. As if to respond to her voice, Origami sent an indifferent glance at Tohka. Yuzuru was around her feet and Kaguya was collapsed a little further away from her. It seems both of them were still conscious but, both their bodies were covered with wounds like Miku and it looked so painful that it made Tohka want to look away in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them were showing signs of a fierce battle during the time Tohka was unconscious.----Most likely, they were protecting the defenseless Tohka from Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka clenched her teeth, she laid Miku's body down gently and stood up with <Sandalphon>in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You bastard……….why would you do this…….!" "I don't understand your question"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami did not move her expression at all and replied back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All of you are Spirits are disasters killing this world; an existence threatening humanity. That reason is enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't make me say this again"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that in a very calm manner, she bent the fingers on her left hand. And as if to match with that, Yuzuru who was collapsed at her feet was lifted up by an invisible hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An…guish. Master……Origami, why………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami brought her eyebrows closer, she extended her hand to Yuzuru's neck and made her stop her words. Origami poured strength into her hand and a painful voice leaked out Yuzuru's throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami did not bother about it and readied the laser blade in her right hand to thrust it into Yuzuru's stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You bastard……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka shouted and prepared <Sandalphon>. But------faster than a beat, there was a shadow flying towards</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami.----It was Kaguya. Kaguya was also buried in the wreckage but, she charged towards Origami with her giant lance while a crazy amount of blood was flowing out of her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----What you doing to Yuzuru, Origamiiiiiiiiiiii!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya's eyes turned bloodshot and she attacked Origami like a devil. Maybe Origami could not take on the sudden attack; Kaguya's lance passed through Origami's Territoy and damaged a part of her CR-unit. "Kuh-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was all. The moment Origami brought her eyebrows closer; Kaguya fell to the ground after getting crushed by an invisible hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya did not give up and raised her face but, she fell down without able to do anything in front of her overwhelming Territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this rate, it's dangerous for Kaguya and Yuzuru. Faster than her words, Tohka kicked the ground and ran towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Tohka stopped far away from Origami.------No, she was forced to stop because she was blocked by an invisible wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems Origami expanded her Territory that far. Her body lost its freedom; forget about stopping Origami, she couldn't even swing her sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, Tobiichi Origami, you…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she groaned painfully, Origami did not bother about it at all and returned her sights back to the laser blade after preparing it again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----It was long. I've finally obtained it. The power to defeat Spirits.----The power to grant my dear wish" After mumbling to herself, Origami made a long thin sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if she released all the last cloudy hesitation and doubt in her as a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will regain myself with this attack. I will defeat all the spirits in this world. Never more-----will people like me occur in this world again"</p>
<p class="null-p">She sharpened her sights after telling that to herself, and poured strength into the hand holding the laser blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tobiichi Origami…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka shook her throat and called Origami. But, the Territory restraining Tohka's body did not loosen even by a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tohka did not give up. Tohka was the only one here that could fight Origami. The moment Tohka lowers her sword, Kaguya, Yuzuru and Miku will definitely get killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The current Origami will definitely do it. And------once she achieved that, there was no mistake she will turn into a monster. Tohka didn't know why. But, Tohka did not want that to happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U----A-aaaaaahhhhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka shouted and used all her power to escape the Territory's binding.</p>
<p class="null-p">However----it was not enough. The strong Territory which could not even be compared to what the previous Origami had, did not let loosen even by a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's useless if she stays like that. She can't save in this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">---She needed power. A bigger power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Tohka felt that, a strong chill attacked Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew this feeling. A few months ago------in the DEM Japan branch, this disgusting feeling was quite close to what she felt back then when Shidou was almost close to getting killed by Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something that does not belong to her appeared inside her and it felt as if she was getting grabbed by a hand. Her consciousness turned thin and instead, a scary feeling of her mind getting filled with some kind of unknown black thing was attacking her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka clenched her teeth. She had no idea what this feeling was. But, she could guess what it was by instinct.-----That power won't save anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka had to remain as herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to save Kaguya.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to save Yuzuru. In order to let Miku live.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also---for that girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was arrogant, violent, no sense of courtesy, foul-mouth, Tohka had no clue what she thinks about and she always disturbed Tohka; In order to grab the hands of the high-minded girl that Tohka really hates.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka had to remain as herself and swing her sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-----Lend me strength………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka shouted Shidou's name and grabbed on the Angel <Sandalphon>'s hilt before pouring strength into the hand holding it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She imagined something flicking in her mind. Tohka felt a somewhat warm feeling flow into her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While holding Yamai Yuzuru's neck, Origami was close to stabbing Yuzuru's body but she frowned her eyebrows from the sudden light born in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she thought Yatogami Tohka who she was stopping with her Territory shouted, Tohka's body started giving off a blinding light.</p>
<p class="null-p">The weird situation did not end at there. Tohka's feeling disappeared from the Territory she used to stop Tohka. No-----it was different. Origami sharpened her sight. It's not like Tohka disappeared. A part of the Territory wrapping Tohka was erased as if a hole was opened in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next moment, Origami felt a strong hostility directed towards her and let go of the hand grabbing Yuzuru'z neck before jumping behind. The moment she did that, the space Origami was at, a pale glowing sword left a light path while passing through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Origami opened her eyes in confusion, Yuzuru's body was released by her Territory and was falling to the ground but someone supported her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">The light was settling down and that person's appearance could be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gasped in reflex when she saw the girl that appeared there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her night colored hair was being played around by the wind. She had crystal eyes silently staring at Origami. In her hands, she was holding a great sword emitting light.-----Yes. It was Yatogami Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the difference was the thing she was wearing now.</p>
<p class="null-p">On her shoulders, breast, and hips-----all those body parts had bluish purple armor on them and she had a skirt emitting a pale glow. The absolute majestic appearance that was able to overpower anyone that sees it was completely different from the one Tohka had just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Astral Dress. The absolute strongest armor and castle that signifies a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not the limit form that the girls were wearing until now, Origami gulped at that perfect and flawless appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">The last time she saw [That] was probably half a year ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Yatogami Tohka transferred to school; it was the opponent that tried to kill Origami at the high-ground park. ---The sword spirit <Princess>was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That appearance……."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami sharpened her expression and mumbled that, Tohka let Yuzuru sleep beside Kaguya before calmly raising her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tobiichi Origami. I hate you. Now, before and it will not change.------but, the [Hate] I have now is most likely different from the old [hate] I had. So------"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will come with the intentions to Kill you-----Don't die, Origami" Tohka said that with a quiet----but however freezing tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just by hearing those words, Origami felt an illusion as if her heart got shot.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had an overwhelming intimidating air around her. Pressure bringing forth despair. A sword pressure that gave her a feeling that her head might get sliced off if she relaxes even by a little attacked Origami's whole body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami did not back down.-----No, rather, this Tohka was what Origami was waiting for instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the strongest Spirit that cut down Origami with one attack. Origami felt that she couldn't advance forward until she was finally able to bring down the perfect <Princess>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with letting out a strong shout, she concentrated her Territory to her body and equipment to increase its strength. It was impossible to bind Tohka's movement now even if she increases the deployment radius. Since that was the case, rather than fruitlessly wasting her Maryoku, it's smarter to strengthen her defense.</p>
<p class="null-p">She swung her laser blade and that light blade headed towards Tohka. After Tohka slightly twitched her eyebrows, she used <Sandalphon>to block the attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was what Origami was aiming for. Origami gave a command in her mind and a part of the laser blade separated.</p>
<p class="null-p">The DEM created CR-unit <Modred>'s main weapon <Clarent>was a weapon that was able to transform into 2 forms, the Maryoku cannon <Clarent Cannon>and Laser blade <Clarent Sword>when she converts its main body within her Territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">However it was only converted to suitably match its respective performance and it was not like it loses its other ability after changing its form.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although a great amount of generated Maryoku was needed to operate a denser Territory, it was possible to perform a cannon attack while maintaining the <Sword>form depending on the way she does it.</p>
<p class="null-p">A splash of Maryoku light was shot upwards from the laser blade's muzzle while it was locking onto <Sandalphon>and it scattered mid-air before attacking Tohka like rain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, as it was a cannon attack while clashing with Tohka, the power was not that high. It was probably a pea shot that could easily be warded off by an attack with <Sandalphon>under normal circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">But currently, that <Sandalphon>was currently being suppressed by Origami. If she recklessly tries to ward off that attack then she might get slashed by Origami instead. No matter what she picked, Tohka could not escape without suffering any damage.</p>
<p class="null-p">---That was supposed to happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, while still clashing with Origami, Tohka kicked the ground and used her overwhelming power to push Origami back and forcefully escaped the cannon's impact range. "Kuh------"</p>
<p class="null-p">She frowned her eyebrows and groaned. Like she thought, Tohka's Reiryoku and arm strength was in a completely different class than before. She can't win in a simple showdown of power. Origami changed the angle of her laser blade and deflected Tohka's sword away before performing a combo with a speed that could not be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka was attacked several times with sword strikes that were able to annihilate a normal person's body with one hit.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Tohka was able to grasp her sword movements and accurately block them all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Taaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka thrust <Sandalphon>into the gap found in the combo as if she was sliding it in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh………."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami saw that attack and blocked it as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slam, slash upwards, thrust, mow, block and brandish downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">The storm of clashing swords was sweeping both sides. ---She can do this. Origami clenched <Clarent>harder.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their abilities are equal. Origami was not the same as the time when she was slashed by Tohka without able to do anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">The current Origami is able to fight a Spirit in its perfect state.</p>
<p class="null-p">Human knowledge works on the disaster killing this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the wish Origami has been yearning and wishing for.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was not wrong. The training Origami accumulated until now was not a waste.</p>
<p class="null-p">---CR-unit <Mordred>. As long as she owns that, Origami is able to defeat Yatogami Tohka, the Yamai sisters, Izayoi Miku and the Spirit that killed Origami's parents 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes.------the Spirit from 5 years ago. As a condition for joining DEM, Origami gained information of that spirit's existence from Ellen Mathers.</p>
<p class="null-p">The specific appearance and its ability was unknown. For information, it was only worth that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it's true that there was another Spirit other than <Efreet>Itsuka Kotori in the city. Confirming that fact itself was really worth looking into DEM's intelligence.</p>
<p class="null-p">The current Origami can achieve it. She can cut off that Spirits head if she finds her but-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, a violent headache struck Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Origami thought she mishandled Tohka's attack and got slashed on her head but-----it was wrong. This pain was clearly from inside her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, her consciousness paused as if it got turned off and her sights were covered with red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah----" "Haaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka did not let that chance go. Tohka performed a side sweep with <Sandalphon>to Origami's free torso.</p>
<p class="null-p">That absolute tyrant attack holds the power to destroy everything. Just like a leaves being played by the wind, Origami was easily blown backwards in a straight line.</p>
<p class="null-p">The debris broken into several fragments from that momentum, she slamed through the building and reached a distance where she could not see Tohka anymore-----she rolled 2 or 3 times on the ground before finally lying down on the ground facing upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuhah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She managed to avoid a life-threatening wound by strengthening the Territory but, the damage to her whole body was serious.</p>
<p class="null-p">No. The serious matter was not the external injuries. Origami wiped her face with hands and clenched her teeth after seeing the red blood that was sticking on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Blood was coming out from her nose and eyes. This was not the first time she had these symptoms. These symptoms were seen happening when she had recklessly use the annihilation weapon <White Licorice>to its activation limit. "Guh…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she noticed it, it seems she abused her brain too much in order to fight back Tohka who got back her complete strength. Origami clenched her teeth in regret, and punched the ground while facing upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">---What equal. What about I can fight with the Spirit. In the end, all Origami has done was erasing her life while somehow managing Tohka's power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami extended her trembling hands to the heavens. It was as if-------she was a devout believer relying on God.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Origami did not believe in the existence of God. Ever since the day her parents got killed in front of her 5 years ago, the word God disappeared from Origami's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">But maybe.</p>
<p class="null-p">If devils and God really does exist in this world then, Origami would definitely offer any sacrifice with those hands. Even if it was a contract to give her heart away once she achieves her goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">She knows it was very unlike herself to think this. Something like entrusting her wish to something that does not exist was nothing more than pure stupidity. Only she can save herself. If she had time to pray, she would rather use it to train. If she had time to wish, she would rather use it to form strategies. And that resulted in the Wizard known as Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_13.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">But-----Origami had nothing left.</p>
<p class="null-p">Blood-puking training, sleepless nights for research, the latest equipment's burdening her body and fighting beside deaths door. All of the ideas Origami could think of was joined together.</p>
<p class="null-p">And this was the result.</p>
<p class="null-p">The power she gained by sacrificing everything does not work on</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">This cruel reality was what awaited Origami after such long battles.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I------"</p>
<p class="null-p">The thought of giving up suddenly passed through Origami's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami weakly sigh, she powerlessly lowered her hand that was holding up to the heavens.</p>
<p class="null-p">---But at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Hey, you. Do you want power?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami could hear a voice which didn't sound like it was from a man or woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh--?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened her eyes wide at the sudden voice and raised her body while groaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she did that, she found an unknown [Something] standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">That [Something] had no other way to describe it so it was called something. Even though she knows it was existing there and yet she was unable to see its real image. Its existence could be called rough but, she felt a hallucination as if there was a noise-like censor blocking its whole body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami used [What] instead of [Who] in reflex. That [Something] might have guessed what she meant and *kusu**kusu* giggled as if it was funny.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not important now regarding what I am. More importantly, what is your answer? Don't you want power? Don't you want an absolute power that won't lose to anyone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gasped and brought her eyebrows closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Origami suspected she gone crazy from the damage she got by using the Realizer. This was clearly a weird situation. It was probably insane to put up with this. But, the answer for that question was already decided. Origami moved her lips in her half-conscious state. "Of course-----I want that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said those words as if she were vomiting them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I…….want power. Even if I have to leave everything. Even if I have to sacrifice everything…..! I want the absolute power to grant my dear wish! I want…….The strongest power that no one can reach!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">That [Something] made a short answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wondered why. Even though she could not see its expression-------she felt the [Something] made a smile for an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Then let me grant you that. The power you wish for"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, that [Something] held out something towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a gem giving off a white glow. Origami's eyes were snatched away for an instant when she saw that magical glow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is………."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bring out your hand if you want power"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Origami was frowning her eyebrows in suspicion, she slowly extended her hands…….and touched that gem.</p>
<p class="null-p">That instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The gem gave off a strong glow and floated up to the sky before------getting sucked into Origami's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is…….." Although Origami was looking down at her chest and mumbled that, the gem was no longer there. "What was that-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">She lifted her face to ask a question but Origami stopped her words. That [Something] suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like she suspected, the reason she had that imagination was probably because she was brought to her limits. Origami reached that conclusion and placed her hands on her forehead. However at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Dokun* her heartbeat made a huge beat and Origami brought her eyebrows closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt as if another heart had formed inside her body and felt a different hot kind of blood pumping into her body. Origami unintentionally fell on her knees from that feeling that she had never felt before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-a-a-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-a-aah----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside her hazy consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt like she was turning into another existence.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………! What's happening!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">AST captain-Kusakabe Ryouko shook her throat when she suddenly heard the alarm echoing in the JGSDF Tenguu Garrison.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, the AST would be training now but------she was currently heading to the control room because there was a certain matter today. After hearing Ryouko's voice, the officer manipulated the console and *Hii* gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thi-this----is one heck of a Reiha reading!" "Reiha reading………..I-is this from DEM too!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko frowns her eyebrows in detest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Actually in regards to Reiha readings, several of them were detected just now.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Berserk>, <Diva>, and also-----<Princess>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially the readings <Princess>gave off suddenly increased and were showing the readings similar to the time they fought with her last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">While they are an organization with the goal to defeat the spirits, the reason why Ryouko and the other AST members were not at the spot even though those monsters appeared in the city was really simple.----It's because of DEM industries.</p>
<p class="null-p">That company was commencing a special practice so they used their influence on the Minister of Defense so that AST would not meddle in their affairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, the group could only glare at the radar in the control room even though they knew Spirits have appeared in the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the officer looking at the values on the screen gulped in a frightened manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no it isnt……! This-----This is a reading not included inside the notice DEM provided beforehand" "What did you say!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko shouted when she heard the officer's words and peeked at the screen after placing her hands on the officer's shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that another Reiha different from the existing Spirits has been detected. What's more, the readings were so big that it would not lose to <Princess>in her full power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means another Spirit appeared in the practice!? Since a Space quake did not occur that would mean that this is a silent appearance…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko made a stern expression. She was told to stand down but, the situations call for her to report this emergency as soon as possible. She could not even imagine what the damages would be, if this Spirit starts fighting with <Princess>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Captain!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the door of the control room was swung opened and 2 small girls entered the room. They were AST member Okamine Mikie and maintenance mechanic Mildred F Fujimura. Mikie was already in her wiring suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone in AST is ready!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The CR-unit is ready too. It can go in full performance anytime"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mikie………Mily………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko called their names and made a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way they could react that fast at the Reiha that just appeared. Most likely, they were already ready for sortie from just now.-----all of them probably had the same feelings as Ryouko.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikie felt shaken and said she would quit AST too when Origami was given her disciplinary punishment, but now, she was doing her duties splendidly. She was cheering herself up by telling herself not to show her pathetic self to Origami when she comes back someday. Ryouko relaxed her mouth after seeing her subordinate's growth. And at the same time with that, the officer raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----! Captain, a message from HQ!" "Yes, this is good timing"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's probably a sortie order. Ryouko anticipated that and took out an emergency equipment device from her pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">But,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, eh, AST continue standing by……..that's about it" Ryouko, Mikie and Mily opened their eyes wide when they heard the officer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what's going on. A spirit appeared in the city you know!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-even if you tell me that……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">The officer made a troubled face. Well, that's normal. She just told the orders that were given by the higher-ups.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ryouko clenched her teeth in anger, she clenched her fist and *Gan*! She punched the wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is the AST for if we can't move in this emergency……….! Are those big-heads in HQ that afraid of</p>
<p class="null-p">DEM…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Origami's face passed through her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">She might have been a problematic member but-------she will never go against her beliefs. Origami will definitely ignore the stand-by order and head out without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">But. If Ryouko does that, the higher-ups would gladly replace her captain status. ----and most likely, she would be replaced by a Wizard influenced by DEM to make things easier to control. That was something she had to avoid no matter what.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ca-captain…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikie made a worried face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryoku looked in pain for a few instant before, "…………Everyone, stay on stand-by…….che"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that as if she was vomiting.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay, Kaguya, Yuzuru!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After blowing Origami away with <Sandalphon>, Tohka ran towards the Yamai sisters lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka could have choose to pursue Origami but, she decided not to do so. It was not her goal to kill Origami in the first place anyway----and more importantly, her priorities now were to confirm Kaguya and Yuzuru's safety now. As to respond to Tohka's voice, Kaguya raised her unsteady body and Yuzuru waved to her powerlessly. Their wounds are not light but, at least they are still conscious. Tohka made a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka…..your appearance"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya withstood the pain and groaned a little before looking over to Tohka and taking a good look at her armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka tilted her head for a moment but, she immediately noticed the reason. Tohka was currently wearing her completed Astral dress that she had manifested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, my powers came back when I thought of saving everyone"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka said that, Kaguya took a good look at Tohka's Astral dress again and *Puu* pouted her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Damn it, that's so cool. What's with that heroic sudden power up. Don't stand out more than your masters when you are my kinsman. Teach me how to do it later"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu………umu"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka nodded to Kaguya's words in reflex but………she could not explain properly on how she did it if she was asked to. Even Tohka had no clue on why the Reiryoku which was supposed to be sealsed by Shidou had returned to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….*cough*, *cough*"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru later raised her body and coughed painfully for several times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Ques-tion. Tohka, where is Master Origami…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she looked over to Tohka. Tohka nodded to respond to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I slammed my sword at her with all my strength. She might not be able to fight for a while but, she won't die. It's true that there is that so-called Teriyaki surrounding her body"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka stabbed <Sandalphon>while saying that, Kaguya and Yuzuru symmetrically tilted their hands to left and right.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Teriyaki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Correction……..is it Territory?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru said that. Now that Tohka thinks about it, it might be called that" "Yeah, that so-called Territory[6]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She should be right this time but, for some reason the Yamai sisters were tilting their head in doubt.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, she had no time to bother about that now. Tohka released her sights from the Yamai sisters and looked behind. Miku was lying down senseless on the messed up road.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not respond even though she was called. It seems she was still unconscious. Tohka ran to Miku and crouched down to peek at her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, what she saw was Miku sleeping peacefully which was the opposite from her expectations. *Suu**suu* she was breathing and would sometimes *Munya**munya* sleep talk. Tohka made a relieved sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…………..you should thank her when she wakes up, Tohka. She was the one who used her body as a shield to protect you when you fainted"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. She was amazing. Her legs were trembling from the start to the end though"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru were supporting each other and approached Miku by following Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu……….Is that so. You saved me, Miku"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka said that, voices started to appear again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---------yes yes, that's why we have to wake her up quick"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu? What should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku, it's obvious. It's already determined that you must perform a passionate kiss to wake a sleeping princess" "Ki-kiss you say!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. That's correct. Okay then, please give it your all. Kiss, kiss"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu-muu…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She might………have no choice. Tohka gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second! I never said that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Yuzuru too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-wha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru told her that and Tohka brought her eyebrows closer. Now that she thinks about it, the voice echoing was a little different from the both of them. Then why----- Tohka then lowered her sights and found Miku slightly opening her eyes while *Nya**nya* smiling broadly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah Miku! You are awake aren't you!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pufufuu! Ahhn, I was found out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka pointed her finger and shouted, Miku started laughing because she couldn't bear it anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mouu, please don't say anything unnecessary Kaguya-san, Yuzuru-saaaan. A little more and I might have enjoyed myself with Tohka-san's pretty lips"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not very nice and what are you saying! Your crimes for using our voices are heavy, Miku! Know that your sins won't clear up even if you fall to purgatory!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Resent. *Angry*"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru made stern faces. After they did that, Miku raised her body and touched both of their legs as if to act flirtatiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. I don't have such intentions. Please forgive me. I will compensate for this with my body………."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Miku licked her lips. In that instant, the Yamai sister's face turned pale and backed off to run away from Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahhn, why are you running away. Wait for me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-shut up! Don't get closer pervert!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Run away. *Cross fingers to form an X*"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku chased after them and both of them ran away while staggering. It was such a peaceful scene that the death match just now was like a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka saw the three of them being lively, she made a sighed in ease before clapping her hands to stop the girls in their game of tag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyways, everyone's injuries aren't light. Let's get fixed up in <Fraxinus>. Can someone contact Kotori?" After saying that, three of them stopped their game of tag and looked at Tohka's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku……let's do that. Well, these injuries are nothing to me but, we have Miku and Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tease. *Poke* *poke*"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Akyaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuzuru poked Kaguya's stomach, Kaguya shouted with tears on her eyes. As expected, what hurts will hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what was that for!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sneer. Nothing to me (Stiff)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I want to try that too! *poke**poke*!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai…….Stop it!" After saying that, the three of them started causing trouble again. Tohka *Haa* sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, please do it. The three of you head to <Fraxinus>first"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku moved her eyebrows in wonder after hearing Tohka's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First…….wait, Tohka-san what are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu. I am going to bring Tobiichi Origami. She most likely can't move by herself. ------I still haven't heard any answers from her mouth"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka said that, the three of them *fuu* exhaled before nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun………..Well it can't be helped if Tohka says that. Of course, no matter what reason she might have, I will have her pay for this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. It's going to be a ticklish sentence. I will break Master Origami's metal mask"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, can we separate the payment? I have a lot of things in my mind I want to do………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku said that with glittering eyes. Kaguya and Yuzuru had sweat flowing their cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka gained everyone's approval, she looked towards the direction she sent Origami flying to just now. Since Tohka was quite pissed, she might have put too much strength into the hit. She could not see her from there-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Mu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus. Tohka twitched her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">Further up her view. She saw someone at the sky covered with ash grey clouds. "? What's wrong, Tohka"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked by Kaguya, Tohka was in loss on how to answer before rubbing her eyes. She thought it was a mistake but----she was wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">A ray of light shined through the gloomy space and inside that light, a girl was floating in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first thing that entered her eyes was her clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However that was only natural. Her body was covered with a dress emphasizing on her body line. She had a skirt like a flower in full bloom. And also, there was a floating ring around her head with veils extending out from it. -----all of it was made by eye-opening pure white.</p>
<p class="null-p">That appearance looked like a wedding dress only permitted to be worn by a pure maiden-----or, an Angel descending from the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..uh, that's-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the reason why Tohka gasped was not because her eyes were stolen by those factors. The same time when that white silhouette was getting closer, the girls face could be seen. ---That was Tobiichi Origami's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Confirm. As expected, Kaguya sees it too huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true……ah-re, but that appearance…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya, Yuzuru and Miku noticed that too. They were raising their eyebrows while saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, their words were immediately interrupted.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. The moment Origami looked over to them------they got attacked by a chill as if countless needles pierced into their body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and the others were opening their eyes wide while standing still blankly. After Tohka clenched her teeth, she then stood in front the three of them to separate Origami from them and prepared <Sandalphon>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To-Tohka……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Run. I can't fight while protecting you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka did not look away from Origami even for a moment and said that with the three of them behind her. Sweat was flowing down from her forehead and it flown down her cheeks before dripping off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and the others did not resist. They did not say they wanted to fight too. It took them only an instant to understand that they can't be any help since they can't use their full Reiryoku. No--------forget providing help, they might even end up being hindrance for Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">The thing that currently appeared in front of the girls has overwhelming power.</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew that by instinct, she didn't need to exchange swords or have a conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">---That. That was something she had to confront.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka, sorry……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pray…….best of luck"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait both of you….ukyaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kaguya and Yuzuru carried Miku by both her shoulders, they then covered themselves with wind and ran to the sky with tremendous speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami did not show interest to them and continued staring at Tohka's direction while slowly approaching her as if she was sliding down from the sky. She then looked down at Tohka and slightly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yatogami…………Tohka. -----to defeat her. I"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Origami, you"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka sharpened her sights, Origami calmly raised her right hand to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then called it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The name Origami was supposed to not know----the name of the angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----<Metatron>"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to respond to Origami's words, several rays of lights came pouring down from the sky which has lost its sun and surrounded Origami. All of those light then materialized and each one of them looked like long slender wings.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time she clenched the hand raised to the sky, all those wings spread out in a circle. Yes. It was as if------Origami was getting crowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka frowned her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Astral dress and………..Angel. There was no mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">She continued looking up and shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..Origami. Why-----why are you a Spirit" Yes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka had no idea what happened when she was helping the other girls. But she can be certain of one thing-----The current Origami was a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spi-rit…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami recited the words Tohka said, she distorted her eyes listlessly and looked down to her hands and body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……..it's just like I thought"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami closed her eyes, she told herself that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then-----I don't mind"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then opened her eyes and pointed her sights to Tohka like a sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will now wield this power to defeat the Spirits. I will become the spirit that kills spirits. Once I eliminate all Spirits----I will erase the last one, me"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami spread both her hands out. As if to match that action, the tip of the crown above her head expanded and made a circle that looks like the sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Metatron>----->---[Shemesh]!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami silently announced that. In an instant, the Angel forming a ring above Origami's head started to spin and release light particles around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka spread out her left hand and made a wall around her with Reiryoku. After an instant, crazy amount of light particles were poured down at her from Origami's angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was such a beautiful and extremely destructive rain. Each drop was clusters of Reiryoku capable of tremendous power and several thousands of it continued overrunning the ground without pause.</p>
<p class="null-p">The asphalt road. The thrown away vehicle. The houses lined up. The fair Angel did not let any of them off the hook. The familiar city scenery was easily destroyed like paper touched by rain.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_14.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Guh………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka somehow managed to block that attack with the shield concentrated with Reiryoku but, this will not go well if this goes on. After Tohka poured in strength into the right hand holding <Sandalphon>, she cut the interior of the wall with full knowledge that she would take few hits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with a powerful shout, the angel <Sandalphon>released a sword slash which extended out as if it was tracing her sword skills.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami slightly twitched her eyebrows, she pointed her other hand downward. When she did that, the ring releasing light particles separated and made a shield in front of Origami to fend off Tohka's slash.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the light particles were interrupted. Tohka did not let this chance go and kicked the ground causing her to fly straight up to the sky and closed in to Origami after slipping through the Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Deyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't have the leisure to hold back her strength. Tohka grabbed <Sandalphon>with both her hands and slashed at Origami with all her might.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----There was no feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment <Sandalphon>touched Origami's Astral dress, Origami's appearance turned to light and disappeared; she then appeared a few meters back from her original position.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka was not the only one opening her eyes in dismay. Even Origami who avoided the attack was distorting her expression in astonishment. It seems that happening was also unexpected for Origami too. After Origami looked at her own hand, she mumbled to herself as if she wants to vomit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Monster"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami frowned her eyebrows and clenched her fist before using that hand and pointing it upwards. "[ Malakh]!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did that, <Metatron>collected itself again and made wings behind Origami. Origami flapped <Metatron>like wings and ran backwards using only an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, several rays of light came from the tip of the wing form <Metratron>and attacked Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why you……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka made a short shout and swung <Sandalphon>. It will be too late if she made a wall anyways and------intuitively, Tohka sensed that she could not block this attack with her wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">She used <Sandalphon>to slash away the approaching light. But, the numbers were too much. The lights beams she could not manage to handle, pierced into her left shoulder and right leg.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gu-ah….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharp pain. She didn't need to see it to know that her Astral dress has been broken.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami's attack did not lighten. The wings behind Origami spread up, down, left, and right, after Origami swung her hand from above straight downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"[Kaddour]!!" The same time Origami shouted, the separated <Metatron>flied freely around the sky as if it was equipped with its own will and released beams from all directions. It looked like she was captured in a cage made by laser grids. What's more, it was a prison that was able to cause her to cut through her bones and flesh if she touches the grids.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka swung <Sandalphon>and struck down all the attacks that were continuously firing from all direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was impossible to respond to all of it. Her back, hips and hands. All of those parts got a direct hit by the destructive beams and Tohka's armor got destroyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……….,u, aah---------"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was going to get one-sidedly tormented at this rate. Tohka made a painful expression while glaring at Origami before kicking the sky with all her strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without even needing to block that charge, <Metatron>added more devastating attacks towards Tohka but, she completely ignored that. Even if she received a direct hit to her stomach, even if her leg got shot through, Tohka did not look away from Origami and continued rushing madly at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She shouted and slashed <Sandalphon>upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu-------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was no effect at all. The moment the sword was about to touch Origami, she turned to light and disappeared resulting in dodging Tohka's attack. After an instant, But----that was within Tohka's prediction.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka let go of <Sandalphon>, she continued using that momentum and twisted her body in mid-air-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She used all her strength, and used her bare hands to punch Origami's face the moment she reappeared in the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Ka,hah…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami spat out painfully and distorted her face. Maybe she might have broken a tooth; one white fragment flew out from her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a full powered right straight from the Spirit-Tohka. Even if Origami became a spirit, forget about her head flying off the attack was enough to mash her skull to pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she was unable to continuously turn to light; or maybe she could not respond attacks she could not perceive, she might not know the details but-----anyway, she managed to give Origami a hit. She clenched her fist tightly and *fuun* snorted.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was impossible to continue her attack there. While Origami was swinging her head dizzily, she once again turned <Metatron>into wings and back off from the spot again with high-speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tsk-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka landed to the ground, she raised her right hand to the side. A few moments later, <Sandalphon>which she threw just now fell down from the sky and beautifully settled in that hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the ground, Tohka looked up at Origami wiping the blood that came from her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">She gave quite some damage to Origami but, it was clear that Tohka's wounds were more serious. If she continued fighting this way then, it was disadvantageous for Tohka since she had less moves. Then----There was only one thing Tohka could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Sandalphon>!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka called out the Angel's name, she kicked the ground with her heel.</p>
<p class="null-p">That name does not only signify the sword in Tohka's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ground then rose as if to respond her call and a giant throne which could easily surpass Tohka's height appeared from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------[ Halvenhelev !!"]…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then called it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The name of the strongest sword; the true form of Tohka's angel-<Sandalphon>.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, several cracks appeared on the throne and it broke into pieces. All of the fragments then joined together with the sword Tohka was holding and------it formed a giant blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's strange ability will make her dodge an attack if it was just one hit. But even so, Origami was not an idiot to fall for the same trick twice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and Reine would have probably thought of a better plan. They would analyze Origami's ability and take on an effective way to fight her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that was beyond Tohka's abilities. What she understood was, to grasp the way by using her sword and fists. What she came up was a very clumsy way to fight her.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words-------She was going to slaughter everything from Origami turning into light and the direction she dodges to in one go with her ultimate attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Kuh----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami probably sensed that; she reverted <Metatron>to its original crown shape from its wing form and pointed the tips downwards----towards Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka could somehow understand the meaning of that. Each of the Angel's tips had power enough to destroy her Astral dress. It was a grand attack with all of those cannons concentrating in one attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Origami!" Having sensed that, Tohka looked up to the sky and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will ask you one more time! Can we----really not understand each other!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………., don't joke with me"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami distorted her face grimly while replying back. For some reason, Tohka could see her as a sobbing young girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My determination will not change. My mission will not change. I will deny----All Spirits!" Tohka took a deep breath when she heard Origami's words. "I see. Then I have no choice"</p>
<p class="null-p">She slowly swung Halvenhelev up. There was black light covering its blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----It's time for your scolding. Prepare yourself, you spoiled child!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop spouting----bullshiiiiiiit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami shouted and raised both her hands forward. When she did that, pure light started to concentrate on <Metatron>tip.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Sandalphon>---[ Halvenhelev ]!!" "<Metatron>----[ Artilife ]!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of their shouts joined together.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky was pure white. The ground was giving off a mysterious light.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of their destructive moves with all of their Reiryoku were going to be fired from top and bottom. But at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Stoooooooooooooooooooppppppppppp!" A loud shout echoed into both their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………uh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Tohka and Origami twitched their shoulders and face towards the direction of the voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">During battle-----something like averting their eyes away from their opponent who was currently pointing a power enough to kill each other was insane. But, Tohka and Origami could not ignore only that voice. That's because------ "Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them opened their eyes wide and called that person's name. Yes. The person that appeared there was Itsuka Shidou whose whereabouts was unknown.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this………why must this happen! Tohka----Origami…..!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, why are you here------"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou frowned his face while making a painful voice, Origami mumbled that blankly and looked away. It was as if she was reluctant to show her own appearance to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami rearranged the crown form <Metatron>into its wing form again before flying to the sky with tremendous speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami! Origamiiiiiiiiii-------!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's echoing shout was the only thing left in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Truth</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes after the residential area was turned into ruins. After reaching an unpopulated high-ground area, Origami finally loosens her speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she took a glance backwards, it seems no one was chasing after her. After Origami silently raised one of her hands, she disassembled the Angel-<Metatron>fixed from its wing-form and landed on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami slightly frowned her eyebrows while watching <Metatron>turn to separate parts and into light particles before disappearing into thin air after she released its bindings.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a weird feeling. Origami was naturally using an unnatural existence which she had no clue existed a few minutes ago, like a weapon she had been using for years.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt disgusted too. Ever since the crystal that [Something] gave her was sucked into her body, she gained the ability to control the Angel based only by her instinct.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was not all. The moment she was about to dodge Tohka's attack, Origami felt her body turning into light for an instant. She turned into something that could no longer be called human anymore. "……..This power"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami mumbled with a volume inaudible to others, she lowered her sights to the pure white clothes she was wearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the strongest and absolute armor a Spirit owns.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. What Origami was wearing was a genuine Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am-----a Spirit………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami spilled those words, she clenched her teeth to hold back the vomit gradually rising from her stomach. A tremendous disgust assaulted her after she realized she turned into the existence she detested, and hated the most.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the reason why she ran away from the spot, even though she was in a conclusive battle with Yatogami</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka. The moment Shidou appeared at that place, the disgust she had towards herself started to rise again even after she numbed it in the fight with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Shidou was the only one she did not want to see her like that. Desiring power no matter what sacrifice it may be, to that Origami, this was her last spoiled wish and-----selfishness.</p>
<p class="null-p">However. She had something she was more concern about than that now.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't need to say it. It was that noise-like [Something] that made Origami into a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, that was……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">The power to turn humans to Spirits. Even though it was an unbelievable ability, Origami has heard it before. It was the mysterious existence Shidou told Origami before.-----A [Something] turned the originally human Itsuka Kotori into a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. [One other Spirit] was in the burning city 5 years ago on that day. That noise-like [Something] had the same ability.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………That's <Phantom>…………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>. That was what Shidou told Origami after that, it was the code name of that unidentified Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no guarantee that the [Something] that appeared in front of Origami was <Phantom>that appeared in front of Shidou and Kotori. In the first place, humanity has too little information about the Spirits. Something like a Spirit with the powers to turn humans into Spirits; she had no idea if that Spirit was the only one existing.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----if that [Something] was the Spirit that appeared at the Tenguu Nankou town then,</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was the one………who killed mom and dad…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">---Then that unidentified [Something] must be Origami's target for her parents revenge.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Origami noticed that possibility, the [Something] had already disappeared and because of that, she could not ask any question to that [Something]. What Origami should do now was to look for that [Something] to confirm its goal, identity and also……..where was it during that day 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"uu…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when she thought to that point, the urge to vomit assaulted Origami again and she frowned her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not only because she turned into a Spirit. The fact that she was turned into a Spirit by the existence that might be her parent's killer became filth wrapping around Origami's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">However. Origami managed to prevent herself from falling to her knees and brought her face forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami did not know why that [Something] gave her Spirit powers. What kind of goal does it have for doing so and why it had to be Origami of all people. Was it just going around increasing Spirits, following its whim?</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----there was one thing she was sure about.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Right now, Origami was a Spirit………and she has the power to defeat Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">AST official equipment. Annihilation weapon <White Licorice>. Personal CR-unit <Mordred>. Origami was currently in a realm that she could not achieve even though she used all types of equipment.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had the absolute power strong enough to fight Tohka-<Princess>in her full power in equal grounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami has gained the [Power] she wished from deep down her heart, even though it may have been gained by the worst form.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's me…….now"</p>
<p class="null-p">---She is able to kill them. The Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not only <Phantom>. Yatogami Tohka. Yoshino. Yamai Kaguya. Yamai Yuzuru. Izayoi Miku. Natsumi and even that Tokisaki Kurumi-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………aa--------"</p>
<p class="null-p">She thought to that point.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami suddenly opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain thought grazed Origami's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was one possibility. It was just a dream Origami imagined by whim. There was no guarantee it would happen. Forget that, the success rate was extremely low.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----She clenched her teeth. By gaining the gear of obtaining the Spirits powers, it has buried the part of that possibility it was missing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If…………that is possible then……."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt goosebumps all around her body. It was different from the disgust just now. She felt a feeling similar to excitement as if she was a victim wandering in a dark cave and found a ray of light shining in between the rocks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gulped down before taking a step forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">---To find a certain person.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-are you okay, Tohka……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, it's nothing"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, Tohka with her body covered with fomentation and bandages nodded. But, that movement might had caused her stomach to hurt because she brought her eye brows closer and made a small groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuu……..mu"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look, don't force yourself. Rest a bit"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….umu, I'll do that"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Tohka obediently lied down on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now the group was in the infirmary located on the first floor of Raizen high school. At first, Shidou wanted to bring Tohka to his house or the Spirit mansion to treat Tohka's wounds but, since the area was messed up badly by Origami and Tohka's fight, he had no choice but to come here.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami left, they met up with Kaguya, Yuzuru, and Miku; including Tohka, they were lying on the beds lined up in the room. It seems they fought with Origami together with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's abilities were used to cover the wounds causing especially bad bleeding but, they had to rely on their own stamina in regards to their own body's regenerative abilities. Everyone was covered with bandages like Tohka and they looked like mummies. The infirmary right now looks exactly like the kings grave sealed during ancient times.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bandages, fomentation and antiseptics were the only medications there. The nurse teacher was not there so Shidou, Yoshino and Natsumi's were the ones performing emergency treatment on them. But…….they could not ask for any luxury now.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami left, he tried contacting <Fraxinus>to have them heal Tohka who was covered in wounds but, the line wouldn't connect as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err………are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhah, you got beat up badly huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino was making a worried face while gently wiping Kaguya's dirty face with a wet cloth. Kaguya made a painful face for an instant but, she immediately [Fu-fuun……..] made a face as if nothing was wrong and acted cool. Well, there were small tears formed on the side of her eyes though.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sigh. Kaguya is acting tough"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-shut up! I am completely okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she was told that by Yuzuru, Kaguya replied back in reflex. It was painful as expected. She exaggeratedly distorted her face before lying back down on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it was a relief knowing that she had the energy to act stubborn. Shidou made a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">……….Incidentally, just now in order to cover everyone's wounds, Natsumi who squeezed out her spirit powers half-forcefully was currently hugging her knees at the corner of the infirmary mumbling something. Somehow, he felt the atmosphere there had gone darker. It seems she had to feel extremely bad to perform emergency treatment on everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch ouch…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Miku who was sleeping on the bed beside the wall made a soft voice while raising her upper body. "What's wrong Miku. Don't force yourself" After Shidou walked closer, Miku swung her hands to stop Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay-. ---More importantly, I have to get to work while I still have my Reiryoku……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Work?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou tilted his head, Miku made an exaggerated nod and clapped her hands twice as if she was using castanets.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Gabriel>-----[Requiem]"</p>
<p class="null-p">And as if to respond to that, several silver pipes appeared around Miku. It was a part of Miku's angel <Gabriel>. After everyone opened their eyes wide in surprise, Miku made a smile and took a bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ladies and gentleman. Welcome to the live limited to only to this evening. Izayoi Miku on stage!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Miku said that, she took a deep breath and her beautiful voice echoed in the room. As if to resonance with that, <Gabriel>squirmed and increased its volume. When she did that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…this is"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Houu…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wonder. The pain got lighter"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and the Yamai sisters opened their eyes wide in surprise and looked down at their body. Looking at that state, Miku made a small smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha………..it's a pain-killer [Song]. It has no healing effects so it's just for relaxation." "No, it's a great help. It's much……better now"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka *Fuu* exhaled and relaxed her body. Shidou made a relieved sigh for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, they were currently in a situation where they can't be optimistic. <Fraxinus>still cannot be contacted and, DEM's secret movements. Also-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Hey, tell me please everyone. What happened to her----Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou somehow managed to control his nervous trembling voice while asking Tohka, the Yamai sisters and Miku. Yes. When Shidou ran to the battle field, it was not a Wizard in DEM's CR-unit but rather----it was a Spirit wearing a pure white Astral dress with an Angel in its hands, opposing Tohka preparing the giant [Halvanhelev].</p>
<p class="null-p">He was shocked when he saw Tohka swinging powers which should be sealed. But, Shidou's head was in extreme chaos ever since he saw the unexpected girl floating in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was originally human. Which means------today, what's more during the battle with Tohka, Origami [Turned] into a Spirit. That was the only conclusion he could come up with.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was really ridiculous and unbelievable. But, Shidou could not take it as a joke and laugh it off. That's because he actually saw Origami turned into Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">No……..more precisely, that was not all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou had an idea on the Spirit that can [Turn humans into Spirits]. ---<Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago, it appeared in front of Shidou and Kotori to turn Kotori into the Spirit-<Efreet>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having no idea what goal it has, it was the existence that hidden Shidou and Kotori's memories of itself from them. And also-----it might be the existence that killed Origami's parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the girls might have seen its appearance since they were fighting Origami. Shidou gulped down while looking at the 4 of them in order. However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…………….I don't know the details. I sent her flying once but………she became like that when she came back" Tohka said it with a difficult face. Kaguya and Yuzuru nodded with the same expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun, even I was surprised. Kuh………..That flashy entrance. I wonder if I can use it as reference……, but white don't match me at all"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. She was very overwhelming. If Tohka didn't have her full Reiryoku then, all of us might have died there"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that before groaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Miku was the only within them that placed her fingers on her chin as if she had something in mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..uuun, I did not see it but…………maybe, Origami-san met up with God too"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thinks back, Miku who was human, also had a history of being turned into a Spirit just like Kotori by the Spirit thought to be <Phantom>. It was only natural to think of its existence after seeing Origami's sudden transformation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Maybe"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou replied that with a soft voice, he started thinking in silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no idea what happened to Origami. But……………it was a fact that Origami turned into the Spirit she detested so much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou recalled Origami's expression when she ran off to the sky after seeing him. The face of the girl who hates the Spirits more than anyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what kind of emotion was swirling in Origami's heart now that she has that self-contradiction. At the very least------there was no doubt that she was feeling tremendous agony and torment that Shidou can't even begin to imagine. Shidou was feeling shaken in his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami………what is she going to do from now on"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou mumbled that to himself, and Tohka raised her voice when she recalled something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I think about it………….She said this. She would use the powers of the Spirit to kill the Spirits. And for last……….She would kill even herself too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was terrified when he heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, more specifically, that was within his expectations.-----it was thinkable, as the worst ending.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou had to find Origami's whereabouts as fast as possible. Impatience was making his heart pump hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">But forget chasing after Origami, Shidou currently had no means to even find her whereabouts.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it's <Fraxinus>they will be able to chase after Origami with the automated camera or observation device but…………..there was no way to confirm that since he can't contact them in the first place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched his teeth in regret. He could not take action just because he was unable to contact <Fraxinus>. He realizes again on how much reliant he was to Kotori and Riene. But, he can't afford to do nothing. Shidou made a thick sigh after he summarized in his mind the things that needed to be done.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Anyway, we have to do something about everyone's injuries first. The alarm will stop soon so let's head to the hospital after that. It's better to have you all examined than this emergency treatment" He had to do something about Origami but, that was his first priority. But at that moment, Shidou noticed a certain problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah………"</p>
<p class="null-p">While letting off a soft voice, he looked over to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that he thinks about it, Tohka has completely manifested her Astral Dress when Shidou got there. Which means-----different from the 3 of them in limit Astral dress, the Reiryoku Shidou sealed has completely returned to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou recalled the memories when Kotori had her Reiryoku completely back flowed into her from Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Kotori said this during that time. The Reiryoku back flowed in a limit form will return back to Shidou as time passes but------the Reiryoku completely back flowed will stabilize and will need to be re-sealed again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which means, Tohka currently possess her full power as a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">If this goes on, Tohka's Reiha will be picked up by AST and the alarm might ring again. In order to avoid that he had to re-seal her as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu………."</p>
<p class="null-p">However. Sweat was flowing down Shidou's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">Re-seal. The meaning of that was of course-----to kiss the target.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more, everyone was injured now. It's a problem to bring Tohka out or get everyone out from the infirmary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu? What's wrong, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka tilted her head in wonder. Even though Shidou's heart skip a beat but, he swung his hands to play it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no………."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, a certain something flew into Shidou's view.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the room's ceiling there were rails surrounding the bed and white curtains were dangling downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. This was the school infirmary. It was normal to have a curtain separating the beds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"C-can I have a moment, everyone. I need to talk to Tohka for a while"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone opened their eyes wide in wonder when they heard Shidou's words but, they immediately nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou confirmed that, he released the curtain collected at the wall and surrounded it around Tohka's bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou? What are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…….Actually"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought his face closer to Tohka's ears and briefly explained about the re-seal with a soft voice. Fumu fumu………….After hearing that, Tohka's face turned red. She then looked around to confirm that everyone did not hear that before looking back to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……….So that means, err, ermmm, we are going……to do it here?" "Errr………Well, that's the case"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's eyes were swimming around in hesitation but, she nodded as if she made up her mind and joined her hands in front of her breasts before closing her eyes.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_15.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Uu…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was something he brought up but, after looking at Tohka like that, Shidou instantly froze on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was exactly like sleeping beauty. Her beautiful sleeping figure made the normal pipe bed and white curtain look like a forest of roses.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he could not keep this up forever. Shidou took a deep breath before calming his heart and brought his lips closer to Tohka's lips while she was lying on the bed. However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when his face reached a distance where he could feel Tohka's breath. Shidou suddenly raised his sights. Somehow, he felt as if someone was looking at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooaah………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He then raised his voice in reflex. Shidou's feelings were correct. The</p>
<p class="null-p">curtain he closed without leaving any gaps slightly opened and coming from that gap, Yoshino, [Yoshinon], Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku and Natsumi were vertically lined up while staring at Shidou and Tohka's directions. "Shi-Shidou-san, what are you……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhah, to do that in a place like this, how daring"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Houu…………Shidou has a fetish on doing whatever he wants to a sleeping girl"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fed up. You necrophilia"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, no fair it's always Tohka-san! Darling, me too! Me too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………D-don't show off you normal fag"</p>
<p class="null-p">Each of them said that before 5 people + 1 object entered the curtain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-uwah…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu…….?Wha-what is this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Tohka were getting crushed by everyone and they were pushed to the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Miku's [Requiem] was in effect, the girl's wounds are serious. Everyone's painful shout echoed in the school's infirmary.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of looking up at the city's stars, she was looking down at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">City lights. Window lights. Car head lights. Colorful illuminations in the city. ------on the roof of a tall building glaring down at the city, Tokisaki Kurumi narrowed her eyes while staring at the several lights glittering in the darkness like stars.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a beauty wearing a blood red and shadow black dress. She had black hair tied up left and right unequally. Her skin was as white as white porcelain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each of those features was more than enough to burn her existence into a person's mind. However, the part that would most definitely be carved into the mind of the person that sees her would definitely be her special eye. ---She had different eye colors. What's more, it was not a mismatch in eye colors. There were small numbers drawn in her glowing gold left eye and clock needles were *Kachi**kachi* ticking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there was no way a girl with that special body features would be human.</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirit. The disaster killing this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was also one of the existences called by that general term by humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus. Kurumi made a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not like she did not feel moved ny the scenery spread out under her eyes, and it's not like she was submerged into a sweet sentimentalism. She had already thrown away those sentimental feelings a long time ago. Kurumi did not come up to this tall building because she wanted to enjoy the night scenery; it was because this location had the view of the whole place and that made it easy to grasp the positions of the [Group of Kurumi] she released into the city, nothing more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. She simply realized a certain matter through her clones.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Oh my oh my"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi made a small shrug with her shoulders, she leaked a sigh again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not even after a few minutes passed, she noticed someone's presence on the building's roof which was supposed to be empty with no one. Kurumi spun behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Well this is a strange visitor" After saying that, she looked at the visitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there was a girl wearing pure white clothes. The reason why her appearance could be seen clearly even though it was in the night was because the clothes were glowing.----Astral Dress. What she was wearing was definitely the same type of clothes as the ones Kurumi were wearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">However. Kurumi raised her lips at the sudden Spirit visitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Long time no see, Origami-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The face of the Spirit belonged to Tobiichi Origami who used to be Kurumi's classmate and a member of AST.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, looks like I was correct to not have you during that time.-----I never would have thought you would turn out this delicious. This is beyond my expectations"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Kurumi licked her lips, Origami's expression did not change. Cautiousness, confusion, even disgust could not be felt from her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi thought she was implying that she didn't need to be cautious to her but-----most likely it was different. Kurumi had no guarantee for this but for some reason; she felt that there was a strong motive hidden inside Origami's eyes. ----It was so big that it was enough to ignore the other emotions she had.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kurumi could not grasp what Origami's motives were. After a moment of silence, she exchanged sights with Origami and *fuuu* sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so, it's amazing you know I was here"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kurumi said that, Origami slowly moved her right hand forward. ----The right hand which was grabbing the neck of a lifeless [Kurumi].</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_16.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">"Uu……aa……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl that looks like Kurumi was giving off a painful groan. When</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi looked at her, she found painful wounds around her body in</p>
<p class="null-p">Astral Dress. It seems she was beaten badly before she was brought here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----It might be hard to find the real one but, it was easy for the current me to capture one of your several clones mixed inside the city" After saying that, Origami let go of the clone's neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……..,*cough*…….*cough*…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">The clone fell down prostrate on the roof and after coughing a few times, she ran into the shadows while glaring hatefully at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my oh my, you were quite rough I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I held myself back from killing her"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun…I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi slid her lips with her finger while raising her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what do you want with me? Don't tell me you think you can beat me now that you became a Spirit? You'll experience pain if you measured my strength by comparing it with my clone"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she bends her fingers as if she was taunting Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, Origami did nothing. She continued staring silently at Kurumi's eyes and talked. "………….I did not come here to fight"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it okay to believe those words? If Origami really had the intentions to fight Kurumi then, she would not let go off the clone and just killed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kurumi distorted her mouth with intentions of taunting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, those are words I never would have thought to come out from the Spirit-hating Origami. Even though you are currently confronting a Spirit that has killed many people, is it okay to not shoot?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Origami twitched her eyebrows for the first time. But even so, Origami did not even try to attack Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had no completely no clues on what Origami's intentions were. Kurumi shrugged her shoulders exaggeratedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then what is it? It's not an invitation for tea right?" After Kurumi said that, Origami made a serious expression and tilted her head forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to ask 1 question"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question………..huh. Ufufu, my answer will depend on the contents"</p>
<p class="null-p">She joked around. Origami might have taken that as a symbol of acknowledgment. She continued staring straight at Kurumi and continued her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That Angel-<Zafkiel>is an Angel that can control time. And each of the 12 numbers has different powers in them"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi silently stroke her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Origami said was roughly correct……….But, it was not enough to make Kurumi alert. She doesn't remember giving a detailed explanation but, Origami has seen Kurumi's Angel-<Zafkiel>before.</p>
<p class="null-p">However. Kurumi brought her eyebrows closer in reflex when she heard Origami's next words.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because,</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Is there a bullet that can send its target to the past within those 12?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because Origami had accurately said the ability of the [Twelve bullet]------The last bullet Kurumi has not shown her before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, for a smart girl like her, it was probably easy to analogize the remaining abilities from the abilities she saw from <Zafkiel>. The power to control time------which means, it was only natural to think of time traveling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..So what if it there is such a thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi replied back while making a suspicious face.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was easy to lie or act dumb. But, Kurumi did not do so. It might be because she got taken back by surprise and…more importantly, the moment she says [No], she felt as if she was denying her own wish. Origami might have taken the answer as a yes and continued talking. "----Tokisaki Kurumi. I want to borrow your power"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi opened her eyes wide in surprise when she heard the unexpected words coming from Origami. "What did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said I want to borrow your power.----The power of your angel"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Oh my, oh my"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi was stroking her chin while crawling her sights on Origami as if to probe for her intentions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you saying I should use the [Twelve bullet] for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi silently made a peaceful smile, she opened her right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">An olden-style infantry gun then popped out from the shadow and settled in her hands. At the same time, Kurumi pointed that gun towards Origami and pulled the trigger without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The shadow bullet loaded in the gun was shot towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the moment Origami's soft skin was about to take the bullet, her body turned to light and disappeared; the shadow bullet lost its target and sliced straight into the night sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a moment, Kurumi immediately turned behind after she noticed a presence behind her.-----Origami who disappeared just now, was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your power is very strong. However, it won't mean anything unless it hits"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Oh my my, you have gained a magnificent magic trick I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi made a friendly smile to avoid having the discomfort in her to be perceived before continuing her words. "And, that is my answer. Sorry but I can't meet your expectations. [Twelve bullet] is a special shot within the bullets I have. There is no reason to give that shot to you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. [Twelve bullet] was Kurumi's last bullet. It was the only method to achieve Kurumi's dearest wish. She had no obligation to use it on Origami who suddenly appeared from the sidelines.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Kurumi said that, Origami continued standing still while staring at Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">After some time pass, Kruumi *Fuu* sighed after losing her patience.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll………ask you this just in case. What are you going to do using [Twelve bullet]? Don't tell me, you want to see a young and innocent Shidou-san………..It's not such a stupid reason right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like she had a change of heart. But she was very interested on what would the Origami who obtained Spirit powers use [Twelve bullet] for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami pondered for a while, she nodded and moved her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you to shoot me with that bullet.-----I want you to send me back 5 years on the 3rd of August"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………5 years back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi brought her eyebrows closer suspiciously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you going to do at that period?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she asked, Origami instantly sharpened her sights and continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will go back 5 years and kill the Spirit that killed my parents. I will void the death of my father and mother.-----I will change History with my power"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that and clenched her fist to show her determination. After hearing that, Kurumi gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Is that, so"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not like she got pressured by Origami's determination. It's just that-----she saw herself in Origami for an instant because of that goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I refuse then what are you going to do?" "I will use any method to make you agree" "…………..Fuun, now you've said it"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi distorted her face, she pointed the gun at Origami again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Use any method, it was easy to know that violence was included in that word. Kurumi could feel the intentions, of forcefully making her shoot [Twelve bullet] if she felt like doing so. Maybe she was underestimating Kurumi or maybe she was high from the Spirit powers she suddenly gained…….</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it's unthinkable for Origami to misread her strength just because of such reasons. If that's the case then, the reason why Origami said those words close to taunting was because she seriously thinks she can make Kurumi surrender or------ she stood in front of Kurumi without calculating anything, either one of those choices.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was hard to think that the smart Origami would perform such a reckless move. But, Kurumi could only think Origami's actions were the latter.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why the calm and composed Origami would move forward without thinking. The reason why she stood in front of the enemy even though she was relying on a possibility that she had no confirmation of whether or not it was possible or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">The possibility of fixing a broken past.</p>
<p class="null-p">The possibility of reliving an event that has passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those sweet temptations easily slip into a person's heart and corrode the person like drugs. They would not mind even if they were aware of the facts and desire it as if they yearn for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Kurumi understood that until it hurts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She silently lowered the gun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Well, okay. Even I feel scared to enter the [Real thing] without using [Twelve bullet] even once. I guess I will use you as an experiment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..! Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami opened her eyes and said that. Her expression was so pure that it was unthinkable for the usual Origami and-----she looked exactly like an innocent child.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..This is breaking my vibe"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi scratched her cheeks, she coughed to regain her composure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so, an enormous amount of Reiryoku is needed to use [Twelve bullet]. Of course, I don't even have the slightest intentions to use my Reiryoku. Can you pay for it?" "I don't mind. How much is needed"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami asked with sincere eyes. After Kurumi erected her index finger, she touched her lips to ponder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It defers on how far the date and time for the time travel. If it is the past then, the amount of Reiryoku consumed will increase exponentially. If it's-----climbing up to 30 years back then, it would be enough to use up a Spirit's life"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….30 years?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami made a suspicious face. Kurumi simply swung her hands to play it off and looked back at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's next-----let's see. The amount of Reiryoku used will change depending on how long you stay at the time you traveled but………..for this, since I never tried this before so I have no grasp of the feeling. Of course, I don't think you will be forced back to the present as soon as you return to the past but, you have to deal with the slight time difference"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind.------There is no problem if it can be managed"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami answered immediately after Kurumi said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She might be feeling confident because no doubt or hesitation could be felt from her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually, for the current Origami, even if the Reiryoku used for time travelling 5 years to the past was consumed, she would probably have enough remaining power to put up a fight. The thick Reiryoku covering Origami could be strongly felt just by standing in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so.----Then"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kurumi spun around in that spot, she pinched her skirt with her free left hand and took an exaggerated bow. "Let's begin. ----okay, come here, <Zaaaaaaaaffffzieeeeeel>"</p>
<p class="null-p">And as if to match with her voice, a giant clock appeared from the shadows lurking under Kurumi's feet.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Zafkiel>. The time controlling Angel Kurumi owns.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi was already holding the infantry gun upwards while *Tan*, *Tan*making that sound by stepping on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Kurumi's shadows expanded in size and crawled on the building roof until it reached Origami's feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----This is" She immediately noticed an abnormality. Origami slightly brought her eyebrows closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, do you remember?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi raised the side of her lips and smiled. Origami stepped on this shadow at school last time.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Time devouring castle>. It was Kurumi's ability that would suck away a human's [Time] once they step into the shadow Kurumi spread outs. It was not the usual range she uses and the shadow was condensed to its limit; this was a special version set to suck the target's Reiryoku directly. Most likely, Origami was feeling her power getting sucked away in extreme speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the last chance if you want to quit. I am insincere. Maybe, I might only steal your Reiryoku and scrap the promise away you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she made a disgusting smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami looked straight at Kurumi and did not look away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..But even so. I have no choice but to rely on you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was words unthinkable from the calculative Origami. After Kurumi tiredly sighed, she waited until she secure enough Reiryoku from Origami before holding the gun in her right hand and poured in strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like what she said just now, she had the choice to suck all of Origami's Reiryoku. Even if she did not do that, she could suck more Reiryoku than the amount needed for [Twelve bullet]. But Kurumi did not do so. The reason……she does not know it too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe, she just wanted to see it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl that reached that method other than her------just what kind of path would be opened by the girl that reached it.</p>
<p class="null-p">---or maybe, how she would reach her end. "<Zafkiel>-----[Twelve bullet]!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then shouted. The name of the last bullet she never shot before while grasping its ability.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Zafkiel>made a creak she have never heard before until now and started giving off a black glow. The excess Reiryoku flicked around like thunder, sending sparks around.</p>
<p class="null-p">It then concentrated on one point----the number XII and thick shadows started splashing out from it before getting sucked into the gun Kurumi was preparing through the nozzle.</p>
<p class="null-p">The gun loaded with the bullet felt like it was shaking in her hands. The super condensed Reiryoku was rampaging inside the gun.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like an invisible being was preventing Kurumi from shooting that bullet. It was like holding a power that would disobey reason and God--the existence that transcends an irreversible and inviolable phenomenon known as time. After Kurumi *nii* distorted her lips, she pointed her gun at Origami---and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, have fun, Origami-san.-----so that you would achieve your dearest wish"</p>
<p class="null-p">The black bullet shot out from the gun flew at a straight line while leaving a black path in the space-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Origami touched her chest; her body was getting warped into the bullet's rotation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The warp turned bigger and not long later, Origami's body distorted into the bullet's trajectory and disappeared into space.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….fuu"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a moment. Kurumi looked at the space Origami was standing just now while getting blown by the night wind while lowering her gun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---Show it to me. The foolish and reckless act of rewriting the world; and how much of it would be forgiven by God"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi mumbled that to herself before relaxing her hands and dropped the gun into the shadow.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"uu…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami slightly frowned her eyebrows. The moment the bullet Kurumi shot touched her chest, she was assaulted by a feeling of her existence getting twisted and her consciousness getting torn to pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no pain. Instead, a feeling of drunkenness and vomiting was lurking in Origami's chest as if she was grabbed by the leg and was swung around violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while, Origami gasped in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time her conscious turned clear, a strong pull of gravity and the feeling of floating in the sky assaulted her this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Right now, Origami was upside down and falling down from the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami poured some strength into her body and stopped mid-air before fixing her posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">The method was not that different from manipulating the Territory when she uses the CR-unit. She would make an order in her mind and twist the space wrapping around her after matching up with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either the power of the Spirits and Wizards are fundamentally the same or Origami's feelings of controlling a CR-unit was linked to match the method of using the Spirit's power inside her memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">If the feeling of [Flying in the sky] was not provided to her as common sense then, she would definitely slam to the ground after she was unable to make immediate decisions.-----in the first place, the current Origami won't die even if she fell from a tall place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was bringing her eyebrows closer from the dull pain left in her head while looking around the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a weird feeling. The sky that was completely dark just now, turned bright like a re-winded scene. She was not clear on what exact time it was but, it was around evening. It was the time where the sun was starting to set and the shadows of the buildings were extending.</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking around the city from the sky, she found out the scenery of the ground was a little different from what she saw when she was on the building.</p>
<p class="null-p">More specifically, the shapes of the large roads and blocks were not that different. The buildings lined up and patterns of signboards hung up were different from Origami's memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she were to state another difference then, the trees growing beside the roadside and the trees in the park was different from just now. Inside Origami's memories, the trees were covered with red leaves but the trees she was seeing now was full with green leaves as if it was in mid-summer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami then looked straight down. She found out she was right in the center of the foundation for a tall building and several heavy equipment were lined up there.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Now that Origami thinks about it, the building Kurumi and Origami was talking on top just now was not still completed 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then recognized it and raised her face again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Tenguu city from 5 years ago"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt goosebumps all around her body when she said those words. Her heartbeat turned wilder from excitement and she could not say anything for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was only natural. Who would blame her to be like that when she was being absentminded from touching her dearest wish that was thought to never be granted. 5 years. Just who would laugh to the girl's emotion when she devoted her life for revenge for a quarter of a human's lifetime.</p>
<p class="null-p">She became a Spirit and returned back to the past to kill the Spirit who killed her parents with the strength of the</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirits. It was an unbelievably weird situation. Most likely, if this was told to Origami from a day back, she would only take it as a bad joke and take it as a ridiculous event.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she knew that this was all reality by feeling this world with her 5 senses. She didn't need to pinch her cheeks to be convinced that this was the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now----Origami was back.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the 3rd of August, 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">The day her parents was killed by a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wished, desired and yearn---She has returned back to the day that was out from her reach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Aah"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami let out her admiration with a volume that no one could hear before making a thin sigh. She then clenched her fist and sharpened her sights as if she was renewing her determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">---That was enough for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">More words will be left to after achieving her goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Origami was finally on the stage. The important part starts now.----Origami recalled back the scenery she saw on that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">The burning city. Her parents that got eradicated by the light poured down from the sky.-----The silhouette of her hated Spirit floating in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">She will kill the Spirit before it kills her father and mother. She will make her parents death event into something that has never happened. She will recreate the world into the world that [Should] happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami would not forgive any tears until that is finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">The enemy is the Spirit and the world. However, there exist not a fragment of flatter and hesitation in Origami's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing in her heart was burning revenge and radiant hope.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami scratched the corner of her eyes with her thumb as if to wipe off the oozing tears, she changed her body direction and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Metatron>-----[ Malakh]"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, light particles sparkled around Origami and all of it gathered behind Origami before <Metatron>in wing-form was manifested.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami moved by flapping [Malakh] wings, and flew in the sky at high speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the direction----was south.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was heading towards the Tenguu Nankou town she used to live ub until 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she succeeded in time traveling, she had no idea how long she could stay in this time. She had to take action quick. If she came all this way and did not find the Spirit for her revenge then-----no, even if she found the Spirit but reached the time limit before defeating it then it would really be a miserable sight to behold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami sharpened the hostility she kept harboring in her heart for many years while rushing towards the residential area of her goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not long later, a loud noise echoed into her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">She thought it was a Space quake alarm for a moment but-----it was wrong. This was a fire alarm, and also the sound of sirens from the ambulance and fire trucks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Origami could feel a heat haze coming from the front.</p>
<p class="null-p">The city in front----was burning.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not a metaphor or joke. The residential area spread out in her view was burning in red flames as if the city was air-raided. The sound of the alarm and siren mixing, the sound of buildings collapsing, loud scorching sounds, the screams of people running in chaos; all of it was exhibiting a scene suitable to be called hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was in Origami's memories too. The great fire that occurred in Nankou town 5 years ago. That event was happening right in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Then-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">The memories of the past resurfaced and caused Origami to be absentminded for a moment but, she regained her composure immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">This fire was caused by Itsuka Kotori----the Fire Spirit <Efreet>. She could not control her Spirit powers and the side-effects of that enormous Reiryoku caused her surroundings to turn into a sea of flames.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then it should be there.</p>
<p class="null-p">---The other Spirit that made Itsuka Kotori into Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu------"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Origami recognized that, she lowered her altitude and flew over the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sparks were scattering, smokes were fuming, and the view was extremely bad. But, Origami did not bother about and crawled her sights at the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then-----found them.</p>
<p class="null-p">She saw an elementary school boy and a young girl in a glowing Astral dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………., Shidou……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami let out her voice in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. There was no mistake; it was Origami's lover-Itsuka Shidou and his sister----Itsuka Kotori from 5 years ago. Which means-----</p>
<p class="null-p">"-------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gulped while slightly turning her sights away from Shidou. Right beside Kotori and Shidou who was lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">[That] was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Age, gender, height, nothing could be understood but, [Something] was definitely there.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit with noise blocking its existence was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she thought, it resembles the existence that gave Origami her Spirit powers.-----was it the same existence? Or maybe it was a different existence that was concealing its identity with the same method. But, those were trivial worthless things to Origami now. "-----Found you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami mumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, she felt her body temperature drop rapidly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you. Found you." Her consciousness turned clear and her view-----only had the Spirit-<Phantom>in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she finally found the target she was yearning for like a maiden in love, Origami's mind was very cool.---- it was so cool that she might even get frostbites.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt her whole existence was calibrating itself to kill [That]. Right now, Origami was pure hostility and also blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----<Metatron>"</p>
<p class="null-p">She raised her right hand and called its name.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did that, the wings manifested behind her flew in the sky independently in a group and pointed its tip downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, a beam gushed out from <Metatron>'s tip and attacked <Phantom>who was standing on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the moment the light was about to reach it, <Phantom>disappeared from the spot just when she thought <Phantom>vibrated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami did not get flustered.----She slowly raised her face forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did that-----she found <Phantom>, who was on the ground just now, at the same height as Origami. It seems it dodged Origami's attack in an instant and flew over there. "---Ah-re?"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>talked to her in a hard to hear voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just when I thought who attacked me all of a sudden…..are you a Spirit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since there was a noise covering its body, she could not see its expression in detail but, she could somewhat know that <Phantom>was taking a surprised posture. It looked at Origami in an interested manner and continued her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's more, that Angel----<Metatron>………..? What's going on? I still have that Sephira crystal with me" <Phantom>tilted her head and said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging by its words, Origami speculated that the Spirit in front of her now was the same existence as the [Something] that gave her Reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami no longer had the disgust that she got when she got the power from her target. Instead, Origami felt an uplifting feeling which was close to a kind of predominance when she thought of killing it with the power given to her by no other than itself, as <Phantom>'s mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, who are you? Where did you come from? Why are you attacking me?" "----------Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami did not answer and shouted before directing her right hand forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to match with that, <Metatron>'s tip pointed forward and shot a beam towards <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>'s body vibrated like just now and dodged it with a paper thin difference.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………That is definitely <Metatron>-----huh. Then the only thinkable way would be……….Did you time travel using <Zafkiel>'s power? If that is the case then………this is a little unexpected. I never would have thought that girl would lend her power to someone else"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>mumbled to itself. But, it did not matter to Origami now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"[Kaddour]………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">---Origami spread out both her hands. As if to match with that action, the wing-form <Metatron>was completely separated into bits and was deployed into the air before pointing its tip to <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"---Haaaaaaaaaaa!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Origami shouted, beams were fired towards <Phantom>from all of the tips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----uh"</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>gasped and barely dodged the beam that was sliding in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, <Metatron>'s continued attacking from all direction without pause. This was at full power and was different from the first shot because she held back on the power to avoid dragging Shidou into the blast.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>probably decided that it would get hit eventually if it stayed there. It escaped backwards to slip past <Metatron>'s range and flew in the sky to run away from Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't let you run…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami sharpened her sights, she kicked the ground to pursue <Phantom>while still deploying <Metatron>into the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">She fired several beams while chasing <Phantom>who was flying in the sky and making complex maneuvers. Even though <Phantom>dodged all of it, its travelling distance gradually turned shorter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa…………it seems my future self has quite a grudge from you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how long did the chase continued, <Phantom>said it with a fed-up voice while flying freely in the sky and dodging the beams.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Fut, sorry, I can't have you killing me here.----Even I have a wish I have to realize no matter what"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's eyebrows got closer when she heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A----Wish?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to respond to Origami's words, <Metatron>flew in the sky like a falcon and made a line of light in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You killed my…father and mother, and you still want a wish…….? Don't screw with me. Don't screw with me. Don't screw with me…………! I won't give you time to hope. I won't give you time to wish. You will die without achieving anything. You will disappear without leaving anything at all. Get lost from this world with regret in that empty heart----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However. <Phantom>tilted its head in wonder after hearing Origami's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Father and mother……? What are you saying? I don't remember. Sorry, but did you mistake me with someone else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gasped when she heard <Phantom>'s words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, <Phantom>'s reply was normal. That's because at the current stage, <Phantom>has not kill Origami's parents yet. It was probably fact that it could not answer anything even if it was pressed with a crime it has not done. But. <Phantom>'s answer showed one absolute truth. <Phantom>said this. [I don't remember].</p>
<p class="null-p">Which means, unless <Phantom>was playing a fool, in this situation where <Phantom>was originally going to kill Origami's parents in just another few minutes, <Phantom>does not even know of their existence and name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those actions were not calculated, thought out-----and had no reason in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">To this Spirit, the fact of killing Origami's parents was not for any principles or goal, it either done it by whim-----like stomping on ants on the roadside; it was just a useless event for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside her head mad in anger, Origami felt her head turn even more messed up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anger filled her body and it felt like it was about to breakthrough her skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Origami no longer had the words to describe this feeling. Anger. Hostility. Detest. Those words could not even show 10% of the insanity filling Origami's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what's certain was-----she will not allow <Phantom>to exist in this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You-----Bastaaaaaaaaaaard!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with a shout, <Metatron>which was spread out it the sky all fired beams at once and attacked <Phantom>. However, <Phantom>dodged all of it with perfect movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">But----That was within her calculations. Origami saw through <Phantom>'s evasion habits during the few minutes of battle and purposely shot the beam in an easy way so it could dodge it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. She made it so <Phantom>'s could only slip into the safe zones. All the beams were made so it could barely dodge them all. However in another hand, the beams formed a cage of light around <Phantom>. It only last a moment to maintain that shape. However, it was more than enough for her. "----Haaaa!</p>
<p class="null-p">Right while the beams of light was still in the sky, she gathered <Metatron>and made it into crown-form on top of <Phantom>before directing an enormous beam from the tip down from the sky as if it was meant to slam <Phantom>down. "……………ch"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the first time <Phantom>was in dismay.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, its judgment was fast. It probably thought that it was impossible to dodge this attack without getting hurt. <Phantom>rammed at the cage of light surrounding it and dodged the pouring beam of light from above in a paper thin difference. With her Reiryoku gathered into that one ultimate attack, Origami's attack pierced into the ground like that after losing its target.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, the wall of Reiryoku covering <Phantom>touched the <Metatron>'s beams formed into a cage and caused sparks of Reiryoku around like fireworks. An intense light spread out nearby and blinded Origami for an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, <Phantom>did not take that chance to attack Origami. It stopped on the spot and talked in a quiet voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..That was magnificent. Even I can't dodge that. To think that you could use <Metatron>this good"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----------?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus. Origami raised her eyebrows in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could not distinguish whether it was female or male just now and <Phantom>voice she could not hear just now turned really clear and shook Origami's eardrum. It was the voice----of a young girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………However, this is a problem. I want to avoid trouble if possible but, it's unthinkable for me to not give a Sephira crystal to a girl that can use power this skillfully…….. While knowing you will go against me, this would mean I will be making a rebellious Spirit………..huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying this, <Phantom>turned around and faced her back to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Its appearance was not an identified existence completely covered in noise anymore-----it was a girl with her long hair fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely, the noise film covering her temporarily disappeared when she forcefully broke through the cage of light. The identity of <Phantom>that she could not recognize until now, was being exposed under the daylight. But, that was not the only reason why Origami stopped attacking even though it was for a moment. ---She felt that she had heard that girl's voice before. "You are----"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl ignored Origami's voice and continued her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Well, I have no choice then. I should be welcoming the birth of a powerful Spirit. I will quietly receive this attack. All of this----is for my wish"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, the girl did not show her face to Origami and made a small wave with her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----okay see you. I will be leaving now. I achieved my goal today anyway. Actually, I want to see more of your powers but…………if I stay here any longer, nothing good will happen" In an instant, the girl slowly disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….! Wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami separated <Metatron>into bits again shot several beams to shoot through the girl's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">But---it was too late.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Metatron>beams passed through the girls shadow and extended into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami glared at the space the girl disappeared into, she clenched her teeth in pain. The regret of letting her parent's killer run away in front of her was filling her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">No. Origami swung her head to deny her own thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that Origami let <Phantom>ran away. She could not kill her parent's killer.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, she managed to achieve a greater goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. <Phantom>'s disappearance would mean that----there is no Spirit to kill Origami's parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Ah, ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked up at the sky while letting out her voice. Origami's parents avoid getting killed.</p>
<p class="null-p">This---will change things.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world will be recreated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the time limit for Kurumi's bullet passes and she returns back to the present, both her gentle father and mother would be waiting for her with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Father……Mother………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tears were oozing out the corner of her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami has achieved it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She gained back her parents with these hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">She erased the fact that was supposed to be unable to overturn. ---and.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami noticed a certain matter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, she looked down at the scenery spread out under her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it was a part of the residential area covered in flames. However, now that she took a good look at it, she felt that she recognized the shape of the road.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That was the place Origami used to live at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then. Origami let out a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a girl, right under Origami who was flying in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing that, Origami got assaulted by a feeling as if her body was squeezed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an elementary school girl with hairs reaching her shoulders and was hold up by a pin. She had a cute face but, the girl's face was currently tragic because she was making a blank expression and was covered with black soot. "That's-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's voice leaked out from her trembling lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no mistake. There was no way she could mistake it. That's.</p>
<p class="null-p">---That was Origami 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……Ah-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Dokun**dokun*.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart bounced.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt her head getting messed up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sight, hearing, smell----several of her senses shut down and an urge to shut off all information of the outer world filled her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami saw it.</p>
<p class="null-p">While she was half-conscious, she moved her sights.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Further up the direction the sitting down elementary school Origami was looking at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……….., ah…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of the Origami 5 years ago. She saw a remarkably big ruin compared to the others in the surroundings. The asphalt road was completely destroyed. No matter how chaotic the fire disaster was, there were no flames that could cause that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if-----the mark was formed from a beam of light that came pouring from above the sky. And in the center of the ruins.</p>
<p class="null-p">Countless flesh and bones which probably had the shape of humans just a few moments ago were scattered about in the center.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It was right where…………Origami shot the beam down towards <Phantom>just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her view shook. Her throat got clogged. Her fingers were trembling. ---The scenery she saw before clearly flashed back to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago. Origami, who came back to the residential area covered in flames, was reunited with her parents in front of her house.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her father and mother were safe. Origami was happy from her heart and was relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, next off, light poured down from the sky and erased her parents in front of her in an instant. She could recall back that memory if she closes her eyes; it was a hellish scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">……………Yes, Origami looked up at the sky at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Up the direction where the light poured down. She looked up as if to find the culprit that killed her parents. She then---saw it.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the sky. There was 1 silhouette.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was how the Origami from 5 years ago who had no knowledge of the Spirit's existence describe it.</p>
<p class="null-p">An Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--------"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami from 5 years ago then looked up from the ground and looked up at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami followed her sights and lowered her sights to her trembling hands. She then looked around her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">The glowing pure white Astral dress covering her slender body.</p>
<p class="null-p">The countless [Wings] hovering in the sky around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">If a stranger were to see her appearance. ---they would probably look at her as an Angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-ah-ah-aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her whole body trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami held her head and twist her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt her body breaking down and disappearing. No, it might be something close to desire.</p>
<p class="null-p">The disgust of wanting to erase herself immediately, filled her brain. The despair of not forgiving her existence filled the gaps of her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the small Origami on the ground opened her mouth while she was making an expression filled with anger and despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice could not be heard since it was erased by the sound of collapsing building and echoing siren. But, those words clearly reached Origami's head even though the voice did not shake her eardrums.</p>
<p class="null-p">---It was you……..you're the one that killed my father and mother.</p>
<div class="null-img-border"><img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_10_17.jpg"></div>
<p class="null-p">---I won't forgive you……..! kill…………I will kill you…..! I will----definitely………! That's.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was none other than the curse that Origami kept repeating in her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami understood everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">She accidentally understood it.</p>
<p class="null-p">5 years ago. Here, the fire of Tenguu city Nankou town had several Spirit's in it just like what Shidou and the others said.</p>
<p class="null-p">But…………..it wasn't 2 Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit that caused the fire, <Efreet>-Itsuka Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who made Kotori into a Spirit, <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">And----The Spirit that came back from the future to kill that <Phantom>…….Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was 3 Spirit there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami let out a blurry voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………I-i……..was the one who killed mother and father-----?" Yes. <Phantom>did not kill Origami's parents. A straight attack that killed Origami's parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was none other than the light Origami released by using <Metatron>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ah, ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she recognized that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami felt an illusion as if the color of the scenery spread out in her view inversed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt the world turning upside down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just before Origami's consciousness shut down, she felt her heart getting painted in pure black.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: The Descending Of The Devil King To Darkness</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">The time is 10:30pm. Shidou and the girls were in a hospital room in the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the previous events, the Space quake alarm was turned off and people returned back to the city and school.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and the group who were locked in a grapple, got scolded by the school nurse on why they did not evacuate before getting transported to the hospital.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though they were in a sealed state, the Spirits had a tougher body than humans. Even if it's just healing wounds, they're much faster than a normal human.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was like that, they can't heal like Kurumi and Kotori so they still had painful wounds on their body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having seen that, it was only normal for the school nurse to call 117 without any argument. Well, to Shidou who was planning to bring them to the hospital, it saved the trouble for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"muuu…………Shidou, I am hungry…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being re-bandaged nicely, Tohka told him. Shidou made a wry smile and shrugged his shoulders. She had dinner just a while ago but, the amount served by the hospital was definitely not enough for Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………seriously, I have no choice huh. But it's already late so, it will be food easy for digestion. Should I buy jelly from the convenience store for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka nodded happily. And when they were having that conversation, the other Spirits who saw that from the side [Buuu] were making unsatisfied voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Shidou. What's the idea of giving the forbidden fruit to my kinsman after leaving me aside"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unsatisfied. Shidou is lacking the awareness that he is Yuzuru and Kaguya's shared property" "Aaah, it's always Tohka-san, that's not fair"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Luckily, it seems the door to the big room was opened so everyone managed to enter the same room. Shidou,</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino and Natsumi had no serious injuries but, since everyone had no home to go back to, they were specially allowed to stay there until they get the confirmation for an empty evacuation facility.</p>
<p class="null-p">In Tenguu city, there exists several temporary facilities for residents to gather after losing their homes from the space quake disaster but since the disaster occurred in the middle of the residential area this time, there were many people who had lost their homes and it caused support to be late.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, the area around the Itsuka house was concluded to be a disaster zone from a Space quake. However, it was only normal. Origami probably did it so that it would turn out this way and-----since a space quake disaster was generally an explosion that occurs when a Spirit appears and when the AST and Spirits fight. It has not stray from that definition.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright alright………..I'll buy some for everyone so wait for me.-----How about you two Yoshino, Natsumi?" After saying that, he looked into the room. Yoshino and Natsumi were sitting side by side on a chair placed at the side of the wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, speaking more precisely, both of them were closing their eyes and while *suu**suu* they were giving off sleeping breaths; they were snuggling by leaning on each other. It seems they fell asleep from the tiredness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou's mouth relaxed, he took an extra blanket and placed it on both of them. A lot of things happened today, it was normal. And.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Hn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slightly brought his eyebrows closer. He could hear a shaking sound from somewhere. "Mu, what's wrong Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I thought I heard a weird sound……wait, ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou noticed the identity of the sound. Yes. It was the vibration from a phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it from Yoshino…..? Now that I think about it, she forgot to turn off her phone before entering the hospital………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his cheeks before, *umu* making a nod. Of course, it was strictly forbidden to use a phone in the hospital but, that's something hard to ask from a Spirit. It was Shidou's mistake to forget about that. "I have no choice……..I can't leave it alone anyways"</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no idea who was the one calling her but, it will be a problem if that person keeps calling if he leaves it alone. In order to turn off the power, Shidou extended his hands to Yoshino's clothes pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-re?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the phone was not in the pocket he picked. It's probably in somewhere else. Shidou counted on the sound of the vibration and looked around Yoshino's body for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh……found it"</p>
<p class="null-p">He found the phone in the pocket in the inner side of her clothes and took it. And at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn………..unn……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino suddenly made a ticklish voice and slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after looking around blankly for a while, her face turned red when she saw him feeling around her body and his face was right in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..! E-errr……….Shidou-hyaan…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, her body froze while tears were oozing out at the corner of her eyes………somehow, it seems she misunderstood something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai…………, you're wrong Yoshino! This is----"</p>
<p class="null-p">And when Shidou was about to explain himself, Natsumi who was sleeping beside Yoshino woke up this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn………..What is it, its so noi…..s-y…."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi then opened her eyes wide and raised her right hand to magnificently launch an uppercut to Shidou's chin. "You, rotten fienddddd!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hebuuu…….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou made an odd shout, he got blown away in a parabolic line from the momentum of Natsumi's uppercut, he then fell face upwards on the hospital floor. *Kan**kan**kan*! The sound of the match being over rang. He thought he heard that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"shi-shidou!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Yoshino and Natsumi were sitting at the other side of the curtain, it was at a blind spot from the bed side. By</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and the girls' view, they probably saw Shidou suddenly get blown away. She opened her eyes wide and let out a surprised voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou weakly swung his hand to tell her that he was alright before stroking his chin while slowly raising his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-are you okay, Yoshino….! Did he do anything strange to you!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-err…….Ye-yes. More importantly, Shidou-san is……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Forget about that useless guy! I-I never thought he would do something that perverted to Yoshino when I was sleeping beside her…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo-you're misunderstanding…..I just-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou showed Yoshino's phone he was holding to Natsumi to explain himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----he raised his eyebrows and stopped his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. On Yoshino's phone's calling screen, he saw a familiar name being displayed on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he recognized that, Shidou immediately pressed the accept button and placed the phone on his ears. He was well-aware that calling in the hospital was forbidden but-----his body moved before he was conscious about that fact.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, he could hear a familiar voice coming from the receiver.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Hello, is this Yoshino?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Kotori! Is it Kotori!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied back in an excited voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. What he heard from the other side of the receiver was definitely Shidou's sister- Kotori's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hou, she's safe huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe they reacted to the name Shidou said, the girls raised their voice. Shidou nodded to reply to them before focusing back on the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou? Aah………this is good, it looks like you're safe. How about everyone else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, everyone's safe------I can't say that but, at least they are alive"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. That is great"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, that's my line. Where were you? Is <Fraxinus>okay? I got worried since I couldn't contact you" After Shidou said that, Kotori turned silent for a while. He could only hear regretful breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Right now, we are in the underground facility <Ratatoskr>owns. The crew is safe somehow. But……we lost. Completely too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes wide in shock when he heard the sudden announcement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Just like what I meant. We lost to DEM. The ship damage is over 30%. Running away after using all the <Ygdd Folium>was our limits. <Fraxinus>is being repaired. The ship is being barely maintained by the Territory but………for a while, please start thinking that it's not possible to use it like we used to"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lost his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like he could not understand her words. But, the word [Defeat] and <Fraxinus>does not stick well in his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, thinking rationally, it was something not impossible. <Fraxinus>is an airship. Then things like this happen too. It's Shidou's own fault for thinking that <Fraxinus>was a place with absolute safety.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The <Fraxinus>got………!? But, the <Ratatoskr>realizer's performance should be better than DEM's…………." "Fundamentally yes…………..but, the gap got quite filled in after the development of DEM new model-<Ashcroft β>. Also-----DEM have that woman"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">That woman. The moment Shidou heard those words. The face of a certain girl popped up in Shidou's mind. She has silky pale blonde hair and eyes filled with confidence.-----The face of the strongest Wizard, Ellen Mather.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou probably understood the situation in the silence. Kotori made a sigh before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Well, talking about the past won't do anything. ----More importantly, tell me something. Where did you go? Everyone being alive would mean that, they beat Tobiichi Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou hesitated for a moment before making a sigh and briefly explained the events that happened a few hours ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">About the fact that he got confined by Origami. About Yoshino and Natsumi saving him. And, by the time he reached the place the Spirits was fighting----he saw Origami as a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tobiichi Origami turned into a Spirit…..!?" Kotori made a voice filled with shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is going on? Did <Phantom>appear……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know. But-----That is the only plausible answer" "………………uh, oh damn. Why at a time like this……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said it painfully. However, it was only natural for her to do so. To Kotori, <Phantom>was someone she has deep connections with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, where's Tobiichi Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She flew somewhere……..I don't know where she went"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….I see. I understand. We will look for her. Shidou, you should start preparing your heart too" "Preparing my heart?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that's obvious right. No matter who it is, a Spirit is a Spirit. You have to conquer Tobiichi Origami next you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah………….."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true now that she mentioned it. Shidou's job is to raise the Spirit's affection level and to seal their Reiryoku by kissing them. Of course, Origami was not an exception too.</p>
<p class="null-p">……..but for some reason, when he thinks of Origami being the opponent, the image of being [Eaten] by Origami instead of [Conquering] her popped up in his mind. Even though the sealing must be done, he feels that a big problem would occur once he kisses her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she noticed Shidou's state, Kotori *Haaa* sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------Oh well, there is plenty more stuff I want to ask too but for now, let's do that when we meet up later. It's bad to talk too long in the hospital anyway"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? How did you………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whose phone are you using to have a conversation with me now?" "Ah---I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Kotori's words, Shidou understood. Now that he thinks about it, he had heard before that there is a tracking device placed in the phones given to the Spirits in case any problems comes up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I sent an organization member there to pick you all up just now; it won't be long until they reach there. Please follow the instructions given later. We will deal with the hospital so, set the tracking device"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I get it………but, everyone is injured………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. It won't be as good as <Fraxinus>but, we have medical realizers here prepared too. They will heal faster here than sleeping in the hospital"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Understood"</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, everyone did not have injuries that would prevent them from moving by themselves. Shidou looked at everyone before making a soft sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The member should be there already. I'll leave the details later"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time with Kotori's words, he could hear the sound of a car engine outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stood up from the spot and looked out the window to find several cars instead of ambulances stopping beside the hospital. Most likely, those were the members Kotori was talking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou noticed the surroundings getting darker. The sky was already dark and the moon could clearly be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I get it. Then, see you later----" And.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou finished his greetings and was about to cut the line, ---At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good Work Ellen"</p>
<p class="null-p">After completing her mission magnificently and finishing several missions, Ellen suddenly got called by that voice when she entered her hotel room.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she looked over, she found Isaac Westcott sitting on the room's sofa as if he was waiting for her return.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Iac"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was a magnificent display of skill. I could only say it's as expected from you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, getting hit once was my calculation's mistake. It seems the opponent had an astounding crew with them" Westcott made a small smile while shrugging his shoulders when he heard Ellen's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, is the crew safe?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unknown. I told them to evacuate but, I got refused"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, now that's disappointing. I will pray that many of the crew would survive"</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott mumbled that without any irony mixed in it. Actually, he was being serious. Ellen's target this time was</p>
<p class="null-p"><Ratatoskr>'s airship and not its crew members. They have the power to hinder DEM's actions, shelter the Spirits; it's also more convenient to leave some power around Itsuka Shidou anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, it's not like all of <Ratatoskr>'s members are packed into that ship. Even if all the crew members were annihilated, that man----Woodman will skillfully fill in that gap.</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott probably understood that too. In response to those words, gloominess could be seen on his face. "---More importantly, Iac"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I know"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Ellen said that, Westcott tilted his head forward to tell her he knew before pointing the terminal on the table to Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain image was being shown on screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">---The appearance of Tobiichi Origami in a pure white Astral dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Ellen also detected a new Reiha reading on the observation device installed in the ship but------she still doubted her ears when she got the report from HQ.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, Tobiichi Origami turned into a Spirit when she was battling with a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, this is unexpected even for me too. I never would have thought she would become a Spirit" After saying that, Westcott made a smile as if he was enjoying this from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I should be grieving on the loss of an excellent Wizard here. -----Aah, how could this happen. She would have definitely been a great addition to our forces"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your mouth is smiling, Iac"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oops, my mistake"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he said that, Westcott did not even try to hide his mouth. Ellen made a soft sigh before continuing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, where is she now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, she was flying around Tenguu city just a while ago but, she suddenly disappeared"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her response disappeared? Does she have the ability to conceal her Reiha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected, you think so too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's obvious that we will target her now that she became a Spirit. It's only natural to hide herself"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder. It's proper to think like that but------It's the Spirit's way of doing things that makes our imagination ineffective to them"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Westcott stood up from the sofa and slowly walked over to the window. The cloudless night sky expanded outside the window and one moon was being enshrined right in the middle. "She might unexpectedly be seeing us from there"</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott said that in a joking tone and made a smile, ---At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Well then, I wonder if Origami achieved her goal."</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the moonlight. Sitting at the edge of a building's roof, Kurumi mumbled to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, who knows?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said that, a voice similar to Kurumi's echoed out from her shadow to reply her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's probably impossible. The world is tough. The wish of a girl will easily be grounded into pieces"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-ra, I don't understand. Did you see Origami-san? If she has that much power, it would be possible for her" "What does [Me] think?" Next, her talkative clones started talking. Kurumi *fuu* exhaled before shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't say anything. ----Well, but personally, I wish Origami would achieve her wish"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kurumi said that, her clones in the shadow giggled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, those are words un-like [Me]. Did you get hit by the moonlight?"</p>
<p class="null-p">How rude.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kurumi did not get mad and raised her lips before looking up at the magnificent moon floating in the sky. The moonlight might make a person mad. Then tonight, the whim of the lunatic Kurumi might have been because she got hit by the moon's poison.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well-----It should be alright. Even I feel like doing that now and then"</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Kurumi placed her body weight on her hands and lightly bent her body, ---At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moon floating in the sky---Split in half.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having seen the sky from the hospital window, Shidou opened his eyes wide at the sudden event.</p>
<p class="null-p">The full moon floating in the sky had a crack in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it's impossible for the moon to really split in half. He immediately noticed a shadow appearing in front of the bright moon.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----He had no clue what it is. It's not a cloud, a sort of bird nor was it an airplane. The space was having cracks and that made it look like the moon was nicely getting cut up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, is there something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's dubious voice could be heard from the phone receiver. But, Shidou could not reply back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, those cracks eroded the moon and covered the light as if it ate the moon. No------Shidou noticed something there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….What is this-----" It was not only the moon.</p>
<p class="null-p">The already night sky got covered by those cracks of darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could finally understand when he focused his eyes. Under the dark sky, an even darker darkness was being formed like a spider's nest.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could not see how big the radius of it was. From what all of what he could see, the sky was being encroached by darkness. Maybe a city, or a state, or maybe the whole of Kantou region, or maybe----- It was spreading wider and wider until it made him think that.</p>
<p class="null-p">A different color than the night sky was spreading in the sky. ---That instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">The darkness formed in the sky vibrated like a living-thing and at the same time, the hospital Shidou and the girls were in was shaking violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh-----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-earthquake…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone panicked; some clung onto the curtain and some even hid under the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But………Shidou picked up something by instinct. This was not an earthquake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately when he done that, an unnatural phenomenon attacked the hospital Shidou and the girls were in.------ condensed darkness poured down from the sky like a black beam and pierced through the ceiling, and floors before going through the next floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">And a few moments later, the beam probably hit the ground and caused a stronger shake compared to the previous attack on the group's hospital room. "Wha….! Wha-what is it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, he thought DEM's Wizards appeared above them and attacked the group but-----he was wrong. When he looked out the window, torrents of black beams that attacked the group just now were pouring down from the sky to destroy the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was lost for words when he saw that scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">Several black beams were being pulled to the ground from the sky. Those beams easily pierced through the buildings lined up and destroyed them all instantaneously. Trees were mowed down, vehicles exploded, and roads were being crushed. The quiet city got destroyed in an instant and turned into a chaotic scene from hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what's happening, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka jumped out of the bed in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to show the destruction of the city, a very loud alarm started to rang.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, an alarm could be heard from the phone's receiver which was in-call. It was slightly different from the sounds in <Fraxinus>but----there was no mistake. That alarm signifies the appearance of a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….! Kotori, this is-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a Spirit! But, what is with this phenomenon…..! A strong Spirit like this appearing all of a sudden without any….wa-r-ning……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows when he heard Kotori's words lose their energy half-way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori? Oi, what's wrong"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This readings--------This is not a normal Spirit. This is…an Inverse-type……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes wide when he heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inverse-type. Shidou has only seen one Spirit called like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He does not know the details. But, he heard that it will appear when a Spirit was filled up with deep despair and it will have a power different from its usual self.</p>
<p class="null-p">And-----it's also the negative Spirit that the leader of Shidou's group's enemy--Isaac Westcott was trying to create.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why………..Why would something like that appear suddenly! Is this DEM's work…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know! Anyway, it's dangerous there! Hurry----"</p>
<p class="null-p">But the moment Kotori urged him to evacuate. Several rays of light exploded from the sky and easily destroyed the hospital the group was in. The ground collapsed and his body was thrown into mid-air. The phone slipped off his hands and flew somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His body and rubble were falling to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, someone suddenly carried him from his stomach and pulled him upwards, helping Shidou to get through the rain of rubble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"*Cough*…….*cough*……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay, Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After coughing, he looked over to the person and found out it was Tohka. It seems, she immediately carried Shidou out from the collapsing hospital.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was in her complete Astral Dress that she manifested. ----yes. In the end, he could not get a time to be together and hasn't performed the re-sealing for her Reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next moment, the other Spirits who were in their limited Astral dress descended behind Tohka. It seems everyone's safe.</p>
<p class="null-p">He let out a relieved sigh for now. But, Shidou and the girls weren't the only ones in the hospital. There are still many other patients, nurses and doctors; they should be trapped under the rubble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh….Everyone! lend me a hand! We need to get rid of this rubble----"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, just when Shidou said that, another beam that should be called dark rain splashed down from the sky again and changed the surrounding scenery. The rubble broke even more, and it looks as if it the ground was gouged out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In this situation, there was no way he could rescue them. No, before even that problem, the hospital was not the only place getting destroyed; the destruction of the whole city was spreading out. First off-----they had to do something about the beam falling down from the sky like rain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she inversed, the opponent was still a Spirit. Then just like that time with Tohka, it should be possible to turn her back to normal. Shidou looked up to the sky and looked at the Spirit for her appearance. And----</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou saw a small shadow in the air and let out an astonished voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the black sky. There was one girl, wearing an Astral dress which looks like it's the embodiment of darkness floating in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was hugging her knees and was looking downwards as if she was rejecting the outside world while slowly drifting in the sky by defying gravity. And as if to protect her, the several [Wing] around her were making a circle around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the hell he could see, that place was the only one quiet and calm as if it was isolated away. Her appearance----looks like an embryo floating in the water.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the Spirit's weird appearance wasn't the reason why Shidou's eyes were stolen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she was squatting, he could not see her face and expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou knew her in one glance.</p>
<p class="null-p">The name of the girl he had talked to many times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ori-gami…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The Spirit floating in the darkness was Shidou's classmate-Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka made a dubious voice. And in the next moment, Kaguya and the others were gasping in terror.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……What is [That]….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doubt. Master Origami……..is that you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she raised her eyebrows in horror. Yoshino's and Miku's reactions were similar with Natsumi's.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it was only natural.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was just floating in the air, the overwhelming pressure Origami was giving off could be understood well by Shidou too.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was exactly the manifestation of despair. The appearance of the [Devil King] that would bring destruction to the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-why…..did this-----" Shidou made a sullen face.</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew that Origami turned into a Spirit. Even though it was for a moment, Shidou had seen her and even the girls said that they fought with Origami who was wearing an Astral Dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that should still be the same Spirit transformation like Kotori and Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">It has only been one evening since Shidou recognized Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">---In that short time, does it mean that Origami experienced a despair that would make her overturn her own existence? In that unbelievable imagination, Shidou gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just……….what happened to you, Origami……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted. But of course, there was no way his voice would reach Origami. The arrows of darkness shot from the sky did not weaken and continued overrunning his familiar city.</p>
<p class="null-p">If the demon world really existed then the city would be suitably called that. The scenery was so weird that it made him carry such an obscure thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami who was rooted to the sky was making the world go crazy by making black trees grow out from the ground. A few minutes ago, the city Shidou was familiar with, has turned into a den of chaotic despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou managed to bring his collapsing body up and shouted once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">That Origami has a strong mentality but, it's still unbelievable for him that she turned into that. He could not imagine what had happened to her. Shidou felt an illusion as if his heart was breaking when he saw her like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou can't fall to his knees now.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that the situation was hopeless. But, If Origami was the inverse Spirit then-----there is still a way left. The girls probably knew that too, they nodded while looking over to Shidou's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----I don't know what happened to Tobiichi Origami but, the only human that can make her sane again would be you Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..aah, that's right"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he nodded, the Yamai sisters looked at each other as if they got affected by Tohka and Shidou's words. They poured strength into their body to hold down their trembling legs before standing beside Shidou on each side. "Ka…..kaka, its good you know. If you even spout even one cowardly line, I would forcefully drag you up to the sky"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Contract………Yuguru and Kaguya will bring you to Master Origami.----Shidou, please wake Master Origami up"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to respond to her voice, Tohka manifested <Sandalphon>and readied it with both her hands. Next off, Kaguya and Yuzuru joined their hands before the nearby wind started to swirl and made Shidou's body float up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya, Yuzuru………sorry for making you two join this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu-fuun, don't worry about it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. As payment, please help Master Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….Aah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, a valor song started echoing. At the same time, he felt that the glow coming from the Astral Dress Tohka and the Yamai sisters were wearing turned stronger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miku!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu. It'll be a problem if you forget about me"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Miku showed a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she did that, Natsumi and Yoshino also raised their voice too next.</p>
<p class="null-p">"F-for the ground…………please leave it to me…….. I think I can block some of the beams with <Zadkiel>'s barrier……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………..Fuun, I'll help out since I have no choice. I will turn the rubble into fluffy cotton"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino……..Natsumi…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou sucked in air, he slowly exhaled it out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was not the only one. That was very re-assuring for him. "Thanks……everyone" After Shidou said that, everyone smiled-----and looked upwards to Origami. "Well---------Let's go! I will open the path! Follow me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka shouted and jumped up to the sky after kicking the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. *Toou*"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to continue after that, the wind covered Kaguya and Yuzuru before they flew to the sky. At the same time, Shidou's body floated up like them while he was being carried in the wind they made.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uuoo………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he turned over from the unfamiliar feeling, he somehow managed to regain his balance. Looking at his state, the Yamai Sister's laughed. "You can fly well unexpectedly, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Praise. How skillful"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..well thanks"</p>
<p class="null-p">He replied back while sweat was flowing down like he was being treated like a child.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that conversation did not last long. Origami probably judged them as a threat when they were flying towards her. The several black [Wing] floating systematically around the squatting Origami changed their trajectory as if they got stimulated suddenly and pointed their tip towards them. Black beams were fired from those tips all together at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Clusters of darkness with a more condensed power compared to the [Rain] falling down attacked the group. Of course for Shidou too, everything would end if the Yamai sisters in their manifested limit Astral dress gets a direct hit. ---But, now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-------!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka brandished her sword together with a loud shout while she was flying in front of Shidou and the girls. And following her sword's movements, the Reiryoku slash was released, countering the approaching attacks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take the chance when I block the attacks, and go! ……..I won't last long."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka made a painful expression while readying her sword again-----when he looked carefully at her, he found several parts of her Astral dress broken and Tohka had painful wounds on her skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Tohka was able to manifest her complete Astral dress, there was no way she could fill in the gaps of the overwhelming number of attacks. What's more, Tohka was in a condition where the wounds she got from the fight she had with Origami previously were not healed yet. It was by no means a situation where a wrong decision could</p>
<p class="null-p">be forgiven.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou frowned his face in reflex. However, he shook his face immediately and raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya! Yuzuru! Please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way he would not feel uneasy at all at Tohka's painful appearance even though she has her full powers back. There was no way his heart wouldn't feel painful; that he had to leave this place to Tohka and move on ahead. But, Shidou still had to go on. He had to return Origami back into Origami as fast as possible. That is the only way to repay everyone for lending him their powers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Let's go"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Yamai sisters probably knew Shidou's determination and nodded without even a pinch of hesitation before twisting their body in the sky and charged towards Origami with a tremendous speed after coming out of Tohka's shadow.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----This is a problem, we can't have you hurting an inverse-type"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when that unexpected voice echoed, a slash came from downwards. The barrier of wind carrying Shidou got dispelled, and Shidou's body got thrown into the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rescue. <Raphael>----[El Nahash]!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the floating feeling was just for a moment. The Pendulum Yuzuru shot from above appeared and covered Shidou's body in wind again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, the dangerous situation did not change. Shidou distorted his expression while glaring at the owner of the voice that appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ellen……..Mathers……….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The person that appeared was a DEM wizard in a white CR-unit----Ellen Mathers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Long time no see, Itsuka Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….I never wanted to see you again though"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Shidou said it in detest, Ellen looked behind without giving him any attention and----took a glance at the crouching Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"------It's a beautiful Inverse-type, not inferior to <Princess>'s at that time. Iac would be very happy with this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………… Don't screw with me! I am not handing Origami to you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You won't achieve anything by howling loudly. Quietly-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"----Uooryaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, a loud shout echoed to interrupt Ellen's words.----It was Kaguya. Having manifested a giant lance Angel, Kaguya charged at Ellen with tremendous speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Kaguya can't take on Ellen now that she could only swing her powers in limit form. Actually, Ellen easily blocked Kaguya's charge attack with the laser blade she was holding. "Tsk----"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she managed to create a chance from the strongest Wizard with that sudden Angel charge attack, even though it was for an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Yuzuru!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Respond. Touu"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the timing as if she knew Kaguya's surprise attack, Yuzuru spun her body in the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did that, Shidou's body which was being supported by Yuzuru's pendulum got shot towards Origami like a marble flicked by a finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gravity suddenly attacked his body and it almost caused him to faint but------he somehow managed to resist it by biting his tongue in his mouth. There was no way he could let go of the good opportunity and time created by Kaguya and Yuzuru's sacrifice with such a reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou advanced with the wind's energy and----approached Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instantly, Shidou was wrapped in a weird float. He was ignoring gravity; it was a weird feeling different from the feeling when he was being covered in the Yamai's wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he raised his eye brows at the feeling as if he got lost in another world for a moment, he immediately recalled back on what he should be doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou called out Origami's name when he saw her hugging her knees while squatting in front of him. However, there was no response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, it's me! It's Shidou! Can you hear me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he shook her shoulders, the results were the same. As if she could not hear anything, she remained lifeless and would not even move.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was clearly a weird situation. Just what could cause that Origami to become like this. Shidou clenched his teeth and made a sullen face.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he had no time to be leisurely. Everyone worked hard to help Shidou reach there. Shidou started thinking desperately for a way to break this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………, that's right-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">He then recalled something-----about the time he dealt with an Inverse-type Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few months ago from now, there was a time when Tohka inversed just like Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, forget about everyone, Tohka even forgotten about her own name and just like what it meant; she turned into someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, the method Shidou used to turn Tohka back to normal----and miraculously enough, it was the same method to seal a Spirit. Which means----A kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could not be sure if he was able to seal her Reiryoku. But, it was possible enough to bring back Origami's consciousness like the time with Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………., Alright……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation was very grim. After Shidou made his decision, he touched Origami's head with his hands and lifted her face which was looking downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">But---At that instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt an impact as if his heart got grabbed tightly and his body froze. The reason was simple. It was Origami's----face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face structure was no different from the normal Origami in his memories. She's the beautiful girl that looks like a doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">But her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ori……..gami……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He said it in a blank tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lightless eyes. Her cheeks were ruined with tears. Dry lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a dead face as if she seen all kinds of despair in this world. If a stranger sees her, they would probably mistake her as a corpse; and it won't be a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Shidou intuitively found out something.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Origami was in an unrecoverable situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-i…….Ori,gami…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">His voice leaked out powerlessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou's body which was covered with a weird float suddenly fell towards the ground as if the existence of gravity came back. ------It was as if, Shidou's broken heart was found out. "U-uwaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou fell down, he crashed to the ground like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guah…….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tremendous pain and impact assaulted his body and it made him immobile. His consciousness turned hazy and he could not breathe for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">But not long later, another feeling other than pain was born in Shidou's body. -----It was a scorching heat enough to make him scream out.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, those flames weren't there to burn Shidou's body. It was the healing flames given by the Spirit of flames-Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou clenched his teeth from the scorching feeling, he raised his body while his breathing was rough. All of the wounds formed on his body, his crumbled bones, and several internal organs healed. Shidou calmed his breathing before placing his hands on his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">The face of Origami he saw just now was burned into his mind and would not leave him. She had dead eyes filled with deep darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no disappointment or bad intentions. There was nothing there at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had an empty face as if she threw everything about herself away. Shidou had no idea on what to say to Origami when she's like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">However. Shidou swung his head to deny the resignation that passed by his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Shidou gives up then at that moment, everything about Origami will end. The Origami Shidou knew about will never come back.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that's something----He will never allow happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's calm, frank, and extremely bad with Tohka, most of her actions are extreme, and would always cause trouble for Shidou----but, he does not want to lose that clumsy girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou made a thin sigh to calm his heart, he lifted his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami who was acting like an embryo was still floating in the middle of the sky. Around her, Tohka and the Yamai sisters were having a chaotic battle with the countless [Wing] and Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should he do? He could not give out a clear answer. But, it was clear that he has to reach Origami once more time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the moment Shidou stepped out again, the several units of [Wing] up in the sky pointed its tips at Shidou. "Wha-----!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped. Several ideas ran around in his mind instantly. Just how would he defend against her attacks? Manifest <Sandalphon>and strike down the [Wing]? Make a shield with <Zadkiel>?</p>
<p class="null-p">Or recklessly withstand it by counting on the recovery abilities given by Kotori? Various thoughts came and went. However, when he was doing that, darkness lighted at the tips of the [Wing] and released it accurately at Shidou after taking a good aim.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh……..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He steeled his body for the incoming attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">However----The attack he predicted did not come.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the [Wing] was about to shoot its beam, a light of Maryoku was splashed from the right side and blasted away the [Wing] pointed its tips towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is………"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked over there, he saw a giant airship with severe damage on its frame somehow maintaining its Territory . "<Fraxinus>!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He called out its name by reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The object floating there was the <Fraxinus>which was supposed to be in a half-destroyed state from the fight with DEM's ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-----Like I thought, you were being reckless"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could hear Kotori's tired voice coming from <Fraxinus>'s outer speaker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Retreat for now-----That's what I want to so but, looks like the situation won't allow any leisure huh. Since the teleporter is active we will pick you up and send you to Tobiichi Origami----" But.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Kotori could finish her words, the [Wing] that <Fraxinus>blew away with their attack, performed complex trajectories in the skies and deployed around <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh------!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's anguish groan leaked out from the speaker.</p>
<p class="null-p">But------That was all he could hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">The several [Wing] hovering in the sky fired beams all at once at <Fraxinus>, and easily broke the Territory before the beams pierced through the ship, which was worn-out from four sides.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh! Kotori!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no answer even though he shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having been pierced by the power beams fired all at once, <Fraxinus>fell towards the ground with flames and smoke coming from every part of its frame.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori-----Kotoriiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou let out a shrill shout, he ran towards the direction that <Fraxinus>was falling to while he was in his half-conscious state.</p>
<p class="null-p">No----more specifically, he was about to run to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh………?</p>
<p class="null-p">He raised his eyebrows at the weird feeling assaulting his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Shidou was about to move from the spot, his body suddenly became heavy and caused him to be immobile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-what the heck………is this………."</p>
<p class="null-p">His body lost its energy and it became hard to maintain his posture. Shidou fell to his knees in reflex.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……., ah………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He distorted his face while pouring strength into his legs to somehow bring himself up. But, the tremendous weariness curling around Shidou's body increased its influence as if to discourage Shidou. Yes-----he felt his energy was getting sucked away by someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, this is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having reached that thought, Shidou let out a painful voice and lowered his sights to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then noticed something weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place Shidou was at was destroyed and was lighted by sparks coming from destroyed street lights but------a shadow continued lurking at the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time he found that out, the shadow under Shidou's foot swell like a living thing and one girl crawled out from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a beautiful girl in a black and red dress; she was so beautiful that it gave him the chills. Her eyes were different, her hair was tied up and her left eye carved with the clock numbers was characteristic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu………Long time no see, Shidou-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl------Kurumi giggled before lifting the hem of her skirt and bending her knees exaggeratedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You………….What, do you want……! At a time like, this----"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou distorted his expression and said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Shidou remembered about the shadow spread out under his foot. <Time Devouring Castle>. It's the field Kurumi uses to suck [Time] from humans.</p>
<p class="null-p">However…………..the effect was in a completely different level compared to what Shidou saw before. Having sealed the powers of several Spirits, although he was feeling tired; it was possible for Shidou to move inside the field. However-----this was clearly different. It has an overwhelming power as if it was stealing Shidou's life by the roots. Shidou could not move normally and was stuck on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi took on an elegant pose and smiled when she heard Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, you said something strange. Don't tell me a wonderful person like Shidou-san would forget my goal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……………ch"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's goal. That's------to eat Shidou, and gain the Reiryoku of the Spirits sealed in Shidou's body. Of course, there was no way he forgot about that. Kurumi's smile broadens.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At a time like this………..you say that right? Ufufu, it's the exact opposite you know? The Spirit's look like they are busy. There's no way I won't let this good chance to get away right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Kurumi walked over to Shidou who has fallen to his knees and lifted Shidou's face with bewitching hand movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's word might be true. It's not like Kurumi was their comrades nor was she affiliated with DEM. Their situation was probably not related to Kurumi. Instead, it was an extremely normal thought to take advantage of this chaos to achieve her goal.</p>
<p class="null-p">But…………Shidou couldn't afford to stop now. "Kurumi…..! Please! Don't disturb me!" After Shidou shouted, Kurumi shrug her shoulders as if his reaction was interesting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my oh my, It's sad to have Shidou-san saying that to me.-----In what form am I disturbing you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I………….I have to save Kotori and the others! I have to save Tohka and the girls! Also-----I have to go to Origami no matter what! If not, Origami is going to-----"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah………."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi leaked out a tired sigh when she heard Shidou's words before narrowing her eyes while looking behind----to take a glance at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her playful attitude from just now vanished and she continued talking in a soft tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"----It's useless"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh-----?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought his eyebrows closer when he heard Kurumi's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everything you do becomes meaningless once you become like that. No voice can reach Origami-san now. -----and even if it's Shidou-san too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch, That's-----You won't know unless you try---rig-ht" Shidou stopped his words half way to stop disheartening himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not like he gave up and it's not like all his energy was sucked up by her <Time Devouring Castle>. But, Kurumi was making a discouraged face which Shidou has not seen before while biting her own thumb. "…………Seriously, what did she find out at that time"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not understanding what Kurumi meant, he made a dubious face. However, Kurumi did not reply and sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well------anyway. I will do what I should be doing"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she said that, Kurumi took a step back and raised both her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to match her actions, 2 slender guns flew out from the shadows under her feet and settled in Kurumi's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">One was a long infantry gun. The other one was a short gun. Both of them had delicate antique designs carved; they were guns from the olden ages.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next off, a giant clock with clock numbers on it appeared from the shadows.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Zafkiel>. The time controlling Angel, Kurumi owns.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come, come, <Zafkiel>. Let us begin"</p>
<p class="null-p">After she said that, <Zafkiel>vibrated by responding to Kurumi's words and shadows seeped out from the clock numbers before settling inside her guns through the muzzles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi then distorted her lips to a smile and pointed two slender guns towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Wha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes in reflex at her unexpected actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's goal was to steal the Reiryoku from Shidou. He could not understand Kurumi's action for a moment and became dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he did not have the leisure to talk. He has no clue what kind of effect the bullet loaded in Kurumi's gun has but, it's not hard to imagine that its effect would be to disadvantage Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou grit his teeth and poured his strength into his body to get away from the place by crawling out of the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ori-gami……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Shidou must not get shot here. He has to climb back up to the sky to save Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Kurumi's voice echoed as if to laugh at Shidou's determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I told you.-----everything you do becomes meaningless once you become like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Kurumi pulled the trigger without any hesitation. The percussion hammer fell and a bullet was shot.</p>
<p class="null-p">The concentrated shadow bullet left a path in the black air and pierced through Shidou who was trying to run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh……….!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a painful expression but-----he immediately brought his eyebrows closer at the weird feeling. It did not hurt at all even though he took a direct hit from the bullet.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment there, he thought Kotori's recovery powers immediately activated but……he was wrong. There wasn't the scorching feeling when his wounds are healing.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, Shidou's [Time] did not come back, advance, or stop. At the very least Shidou could not find any aftereffects from the bullet by his cognition.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuru………..mi? What are you planning to do……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou turned to Kurumi when he felt dubious, at that moment, Kurumi made a charming smile and placed her finger into the trigger hole of the other slender gun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, that's right huh, I guess in your words it would be----" She then smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay then-----Let's begin our war?" Kurumi pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The black bullet pierced his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like the bullet just now, this bullet did not hurt even though it landed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But------</p>
<p class="null-p">"U………Ah………uh………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the bullet was shot into his head, Shidou felt a weird feeling as if his body turned into a gel state and was shoved into a mixer before stirred recklessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">He lost his sense of balance, and could not distinguish up from down. His feelings turned weak as if his consciousness was getting cut into small pieces and-----Shidou fainted.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">---His consciousness which has fallen into the darkness slowly came back. During that event, the first thing Shidou felt was it was hot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, it was not like severe heat like Kotori's flames. It was lower in temperature and it felt like the heat from a distant fire.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds. Shidou slightly opened his eyelids.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he immediately closed his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. The moment he opened his eyelids, a blinding light flew into his view and it burned his eyes which became used to darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was in disclosure while he immersed himself in thought. What was that light……?</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Shidou thought he was secured by the hospital or the <Rataoskr>underground facility, and was placed on top a surgery table after losing consciousness from getting shot by Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-----he immediately found out that his imagination was wrong. His eardrums captured the sound of bugs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………….Cicada?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou twist his head and opened his eyelids while placing the palms of his hands in front of his eyes to make a shade.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, he found out he was outside----and what's more, he was sleeping in the middle of the road. Adding on, the sun was shining brilliantly and was illumination his surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh………? Eh………..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou raised his body, he looked around restlessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou thought it became day time when he was unconscious but-----he was wrong. The world Shidou was in right now was clearly weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why……….The city isn't destroyed……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The city that Origami mercilessly destroyed was back to normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows in doubt while looking at his surroundings again to grasp the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place Shidou was lying down was a path with little people passing by. Even if the exposure from the sun was not that bad, sunlight was pouring down reaching to every corners of the road…………rather, it was just a little hot. Just like summer time.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou recalled something he realized just now. ----Yes. Voices of various species of cicadas were echoing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Adding on, green trees could be seen growing beside the road, and the pedestrians were wearing short sleeved clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………….What the heck is this"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was making a surprised expression while he was using his sweaty shirt to fan himself. It's like…….Forget that, it really is summer.</p>
<p class="null-p">---Weird. This is clearly weird. Shidou placed his hands on his forehead and started thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Shidou's memories were correct, then it's November now. It's the time when red leaves should be gone and the footsteps of winter are approaching.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the scenery expanding in his view could only be seen as summer. "No…more importantly"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou swung his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true that he can't ignore this important problem. But, there was something he had to confirm first now. Of course----It was about Tohka, Origami and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka! Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou stood up while staggering, he raised his voice. But, there was no reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori! Yoshino! Natsumi! Miku! Kaguya! Yuzuru!……..Kurumii! Anyone! Is there anyone!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he shouted, there was no one that would respond to his call. There were several pedestrians looking at him with a suspicious sight as if they noticed Shidou's existence because of his voice. "Damn, Just what is going on here………..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched his fist and punched a block wall in irritation.</p>
<p class="null-p">If his hand didn't hurt then, he might be able to laugh off this situation as a dream. But, the dull pain when he punched the concrete was immediately felt at his harden fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the world that Shidou has been seeing until now might be a dream instead? Origami turning into a Spirit was just a nonsensical event and all of that just happened inside Shidou's head? He know that this was not true and that unavoidable thought was erased.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was with this place? Where did Tohka, Origami and the others go? Why is the season different? ---He had no idea on what was happening to his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……..Guh"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he won't understand anything if he stands stills there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou must get as much information possible, so he walked forward in an unsteady state.</p>
<p class="null-p">And not long later, he reached an open space. It was a wide main street. There were various shops lined up on both sides on the road and many people were coming and going.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This…..is……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment. Shidou brought his eyebrows closer. He felt the scenery was familiar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tenguu City…..right…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. This was definitely Tenguu city. This was the road Shidou has passed by countless times already. But……weird. Something's weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">The buildings that should be familiar to him were………..somehow clashing with his memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he was not conscious of the buildings' minor details when passing through, he could not clearly designate which parts were different but----It was a weird feeling, as if he had made his way into a parallel world that looks like his world.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou tried searching for the identity of that weird feeling, he walked forward while looking at his surroundings attentively.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah……….!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked around restlessly while walking and ended up bumping into a girl walking in front him. The girl fell on her butt and the memo she held fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-sorry, I was daydreaming…..!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, I apologize too"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou apologized in panic, the girl immediately stood up and bow down. Shidou bent down and picked up the memo that fell onto the ground before handing it to the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">But………….at that moment, he froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. He knows this small girl wearing glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……….Ta-Tama-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It was Shidou's homeroom teacher-Okamine Tamae.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Tama-chan-sensei opened her eyes wide in an unexpected manner. "You……….How did you know my nickname?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she tilted her head. Shidou made a surprised expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh….? No, what are you saying? It's me. Itsuka Shidou" "Errrr……….."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tama-chan-sensei thought for a while, she opened her eyes wide as if she suddenly realized something and immediately *Poh*……….her cheeks turned red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-is this perhaps, that? Are you hitting on me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Shidou brought his eyebrows closer, it seems that Tama-chan did not worry about it. She was being bashful and continued her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Iyaaa, it really happens huh, this kind of stuff. Ufufu, oh this is embarrassing. Ah, but how old are you? I am often mistaken as underage but, I am already 24 you know?" "………….no, please don't deflate your age by 5 years"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou opened his eyes half-way and said that while sweat was flowing down his forehead. Speaking of the famous teacher Tama-chan of Raizen high school, she's a maiden at the critical age of 29 years old. Everyone in the class knows that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the moment Shidou said that, Tama-chan's [Mumuu!] turned stern.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, I did not deflate my age, how rude!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no, that's because Sensei should be 29……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you saying that again! Enough! Please give me back my memo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan pulled away the memo from Shidou's hands. She then opened it while complaining and started walking to brush aside Shidou while lowering her sights.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How rude of you. To a girl you first met…….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………..uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tama-chan passed by Shidou, he opened his eyes wide when he saw the date in her opened memo.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-what is it…….?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan sent a dubious sight when she saw Shidou suddenly raise a stupid voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the current Shidou did not worry about that. There was only one point----the number printed in the memo was controlling Shidou's consciousness. "So-Sorry, and…..Is that [Today]'s page?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…….? What are you saying? It's obvious right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tama-chan made a suspicious face, she opened her memo and showed Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought his face closer to the page and started at the date printed into the paper. And.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….., 5 years ago….?" He mumbled blankly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The date written was from 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be continued</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterwords</p>
<p class="null-p">How do you do. My favorite lost ship is [Ragudo Mezegis]. It's Tachibana Koushi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Okay with that said, it's finally Volume 10. It's has entered the grand double-digit. And reaching this point, we have Origami as the cover page. It's interesting that Volume 1 was Tohka and Volume 10 is Tobiichi.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's finally the Origami volume. Since the plot of the story is different from the beginning season of [Date], it was quite fun to write it. Origami's cover page was seriously cool. Incidentally, the concept for the Astral Dress this time is Angel + Wedding dress. Tsunako-san drew a beautiful illustration this time too. However, Origami in a wedding dress…………there's an evil feeling coming from it *Mepo*. Ah, this is a completely irrelevant talk but, there was a case where…………a marriage registration form with false information was submitted without the person knowing and all of a sudden, the victim ended up being someone's spouse. That's scary. We have to be careful. Well, that's totally irreverent to this though.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well then, the afterwords page this time is longer than usual this time but, since there is a lot of announcement and information to match up with the length, I think of introducing it by time period.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Volume 0</p>
