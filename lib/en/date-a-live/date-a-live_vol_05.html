<p class="null-h1">Prologue: Reverse Conquest</p>
<p class="null-p">"…How did it end up like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, after muttering hopelessly, blinked to check what kind of situation he was being put in right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou confirmed that there were two girls in his field of vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of them had bright colored hair and it was fixed up. She looked like a girl with an unyielding spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both sides of her cute lips were slightly raised, and a beautiful bold smile floated on her face. From her exposed collarbone to her neck was exquisite curve in contrast to her exaggerated behavior. There was a ticklish charm overflowing out from her that was stirring somewhere in his senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…oh, Shidou. What is troubling you? All you have to do is choose me,</p>
<p class="null-p">Yamai Kaguya. If you do that, I will see to it that all your dreams come to fruition."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, the girl‐Kaguya pulled out her hand elegantly as if she was performing in an opera, and lifted Shidou's chin. It was such a simple action, and yet, it felt like electric shocks were assaulting and flowing inside his brain.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐that wasn't all to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other girl looked strangely like Kaguya‐to the point you could wonder whether she was a Doppelganger‐and her looks were almost the same as the latter's.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hair was braided into three strands, and her eyes had no trace of energy in them. In contrast to that, Shidou's eyes were instinctively fixed on her proportions, while he being charmed by the sexy feeling from looking at it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Temptation. Shidou, instead of Kaguya, please choose Yuzuru. If you were to take Kaguya's weak body, you would only be compensated by a tasteless pleasure."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she used the tip of her fingers to pat Shidou's cheeks. Shidou spontaneously stiffened up at that sensual feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu…give up, give up. If someone like you were to make a move on him, you would only be bothering Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sarcastic laugh. Since you can't beat me directly, you must do something shameful like picking on Yuzuru's actions."</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as Kaguya and Yuzuru's eyes met, both of them looked back at Shidou at the same time, and then, again at the same time, both of them immediately held their hands out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Who would you pick?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, e-even if you say something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was letting cold sweat surface on his face while withdrawing back.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he did that…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey…I am the cuter one, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Is Yuzuru…no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And like that, both of them were looking up at Shidou while asking him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside his head, confusion and questions were spinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is true that in order to save the Spirits, and to save the world, Shidou must conduct his capture.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet…why.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was the one currently being captured by the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Shidou was putting on a fuzzy smile while trying to dodge their questions, Kaguya and Yuzuru stretched their hands even further toward him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well‐From either side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Shidou. Please choose."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: DEM's Plans</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"so, I am going to announce your punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice of a man with a calm but heavy tone resounded in Origami's ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, in one of the JGSDF garrison's room, a few men were sitting in a row, and were staring at Origami, who was in the middle of the room. It seemed as if they were blaming Origami for something.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was only natural.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, an interrogation was being held now, so that Origami could defend herself from her previous deplorable actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man sitting in front of her‐General Kiritani, continued to speak in a dignified manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Master Sergeant Tobiichi will be reprimanded and punished. Think of it that you will not be touching the Realizer a second time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">These were the words she expected. Without changing her expression, she made a weak sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">The outcome was something that had already been decided long before the interrogation even began.</p>
<p class="null-p">Through pro forma, even though the defense direct supervisor superior Kusakabe Ryouko was attending, she had not been giving a lot of proposals. This was, in the end, one of the processes that she was following on punishing Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, that was how messy the situation Origami had caused. This was only normal. Rather than that, the action Origami made had been done despite knowing the consequences.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it is that Spirit. If Origami was able to bring down the fire Spirit 'Ifreet' that killed both her parents, she would no longer care if she doesn't have to fight anymore and pulled the trigger of the annihilation soldier clothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's miscalculation…'Ifreet', Itsuka Kotori, was not her target of revenge for her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">No‐that fact had not been confirmed yet. But Origami also couldn't throw away the words Shidou told her after risking his own life as a total lie. If by any chance what Shidou said was true, that 5 years ago at that place, there was one more Spirit present, then Origami would lose the chance to chase to real culprit right here and now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that fact, Origami who did not get agitated to anything thoughtless, felt like her heart was being pressed tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, the room door opened, and all of the men sitting in a row in the room poured their sights towards that direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, there is an interrogation being held now. Who told you to enter‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time as Kiritani said that while frowning, he also turned his face to look at the intruder, and stopped his words midway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mister Westcott?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the face of discomfort and his puzzled voice, Origami turned behind and took a glance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there, a man was standing, accompanied by a girl who appeared to be a secretary.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was a tall man wearing a jet black suit. His hair was dark ash blond, and he had a pair of sharp eyes as if a knife was used to cut a slit on his face. His age should around 30 years old, yet, he was a mysterious man that gave off a feeling that of being an experienced veteran.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that man's face, and hearing Kiritani saying that person's name, Origami moved her eyebrows a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">DEM Company's managing director, Sir Isaac Ray Peram Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was the substantial top of the manufacturers who were the only ones that could produce the Realizer in the entire world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"aah. Looks like all of you were in the middle of something. Sorry for the rudeness."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Westcott looked around the room, he shrugged his shoulders a little while saying that in fluent Japanese.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh, why is someone like you in a place like this…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiritani said that in a flustered manner and turned his eyes towards Westcott's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well you see, although I managed to give you all a present, the 'White Licorice', I heard that Mana is down. And since I planned to come to Japan too, so while I am at it I thought I would come to give some encouragement to all of you but…something interesting reached my ears along the way. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something interesting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kiritani tilted his head, Westcott nodded exaggeratedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is the AST member who activated the 'White Licorice' and fought with the Spirit in here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">From Westcott words, Kiritani gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was probably a normal reaction. DW-029 'White Licorice', the annihilation soldier clothing that Origami used recklessly, was DEM's experimental unit. It was the crystallization of concealment technology. Before the talk of saying it was difficult for practical use, the said equipment was only permitted for DEM's transferred employee Mana to activate only.</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott probably guessed Kiritani's thoughts and swung his head in a manner as if he was in a play.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should not hastily jump to conclusions. It is not like I was planning, to blame you or use this deplorable act as a shield to make someone forcibly follow my demands."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Then why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is just pure curiosity. Although she was able to ride it for just a few moments, I was curious on what type of a person that Wizard, who was able to ride that crazy thing, would be. Well‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Westcott turned his sights towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think it would be a cute and lovely lady like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In his sights, Origami felt a weird and creepy feeling and *Gulp* she drank down the saliva in her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">He probably thought that by doing that he had transmitted his thoughts, and made a dry smile while shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, as if to interrupt that exchange, General Kiritani purposely coughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please let us properly apologize later regarding on this matter. I was also planning to give the punishment to the First Lieutenant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by punishment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We came to the conclusion that it would be proper to give her a disciplinary discharge following past treatments."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kiritani said it clearly, Westcott made a huge sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying? There aren't many Wizards out there that are in that level to be able to control that thing, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That is not the problem, Mister. This is law within the squads."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">From Kiritani words, Westcott made a pose by exaggeratedly placing his hands on his forehead, and made a thin sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then pointed his hands at Kiritani's desk, and brought his face forward without hesitation before opening his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Do you still not understand, even though I am saying this much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">From Westcott words, all of the military officers sitting in a row gasped at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was certain that he had that much impact but‐that was not all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isaac Westcott was the DEM Company's managing director. Which means, even though he was the man that controls all the Realizers in the world, he was not a man to talk much.</p>
<p class="null-p">30 years ago, a few people gained the technology of miracles.</p>
<p class="null-p">A fragment of "Magic" that could make daydreams manifest into reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was not officially announced to the public, the Realizers were already deployed to each country's major organizations.</p>
<p class="null-p">If by any chance, by the whim of the DEM Company, the situation turned into them not supplying the Realizers to specific countries, there might be a chance that those countries might suffer a huge reduction in their powers.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of General Kiritani gulping down his saliva could be heard. In addition to that, the JGSDF right now had made a huge debt with the DEM Company. If he were to make a mistake in his judgments and make a mistake concerning Westcott's mood, then there is probably no mistake that things would be troubling.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, when Kiritani clenched his teeth, he hit the table with his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Don't underestimate me, you private enterprise. I will not change the decision. First Lieutenant Tobiichi is getting a disciplinary discharge." He said that, and then glared straight at Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, the sound of someone gulping could be heard but‐there was no one who wanted to make an objection.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a normal thing to do. The precedence of things like the JGSDF executives giving into the demands of a foreign enterprise, couldn't be made in a place like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Splendid."</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott who was crossing his sights with Kiritani went silent for a few moments, and made a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then took out a smart phone from the pocket inside his jacket, and then started calling someone with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, nice to meet you. Long time no chat. Yes, but in reality there is something I want to discuss with you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And after exchanging some words with the other side, Westcott handed the phone to Kiritani.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? What are you‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You will understand if you answer it."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Kiritani was distorting his expression to doubt, he then took Westcott's phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, after a few seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Minister of Defense Saeki…?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiritani rocked his chair with a clank, while his face was dyed in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha…but. ‐n, no, there is no way that kind of thing is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While sweat was oozing out of Kiritani's forehead, there was a huge wrinkle carved in between his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiritani finished his telephone call and threw the phone right back at Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooototo. Treat it with care please, since this is the latest model."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…You bastard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, the Siberian control is really a wonderful system, isn't it. Without using physical strength to pin down an opponent, the whole thing can be settled by being a little intimate with one gentleman."</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott then put the phone into his pocket, and send his sights back to Kiritani while shrugging, Westcott then showed his palm of his hands as if to quicken the proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiritani groaned, irritated, raised the scroll he hit away and, slammed it on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…First Lieutenant Origami, will be dealt with a house arrest for an interval of 2 months…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"'</p>
<p class="null-p">From that announcement, all of the executives that were lined up opened their eyes wide. House arrest‐in other words, the prohibition of using the Realizer.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the things Origami knew about, this was an unbelievably soft punishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"General. That is-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Silence. I already told you what the punishment is. The interrogation ends here. Hurry up and get lost!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami was trying to say something, Ryouko panicked and grabbed Origami's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pa,pardon me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that and saluted, she then took Origami and walked out of the room in a fast pace.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that occasion, Westcott raised his hands a little, performing an action as if he was a friend but, Origami replied back by only giving back a glance, she then passed through the door while she was still being pulled by Ryouko.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko then continued taking Origami and walked a little further from the room, and after reaching a distance where their voices could not be heard, Ryouko then let out her words again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Origami, what were you trying to say just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No matter if it was indirect or not, for the JGSDF to give in to the demands of a foreign enterprise is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">During the time she was saying that, Origami was *SUPAN*!, hit on the head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is my line. What are you going to do if you say something untactful and get punished again!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That is a problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami said that, Ryouko scratched her head and sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, isn't it okay like this? Whether or not it is by coincidence, think of it as God sending a angel with a scary face to help you… You want to take revenge, for your parents right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Ryouko's words, Origami nodded while gripping on the scroll tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko face slackened and she lowered her head as if she was satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment Ryouko suddenly frowned, and sent her sights to the depths of the pathway.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she turned her back to that something that was attracting her, she found two heads peeking out from the corner of a bend in the corridor.</p>
<p class="null-p">After exchanging glances with Ryouko, they walked quietly to that spot, and then,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Ryouko suddenly shouted, 2 of the heads twitched and collapsed onto each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ou,ouch ouch…What was that for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mugyuuu, hea, heavy, Mike, you're heavy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The 2 people here were girls that were around their mid teens. One of them was a girl with her hair tied into 2, and was having a Raizen high school uniform covering her body. The other girl, was wearing a slightly bigger white robe over her working clothes and was wearing glasses, she was a girl with blue eyes and blond hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Second-class soldier Takamine Mikie and Second-class non commissioned officer Mildred F. Fujimura. They have a difference of a combat personal and a mechanic but, both parties were AST members just like Origami and Ryouko. Since this duo's ages were close to Origami's they were strangely attached to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mikie and Mily. You girls…What are you doing in a place like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While folding her arms, Ryouko asked them with half her eyes closed. The two girls corrected their posture, and started hastily swinging their hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, err, Well that is about, ehhh, what was it already, Mily?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ueh!? It's troubling even if you swing it to Mily ‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the state of these two, Ryouko made a big sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's probably something like worrying about Origami anyway…seriously."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A, Auuuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mily and Mikie said it apologetically, they narrowed their shoulders in despondence.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Mikie immediately raised her face and sent her sights towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S,so…How did it go, Origami-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mikie shouted and said that, Mily followed her and came forward. From looking at these two states, "Seriously" Ryouko again made a face as if she given up and spilled a long sigh. After that, "Answer them" she jerked her chin to Origami as if to tell her that.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami replied back to Ryouko by lowering her head a little, she moved her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I was told and given a 2 months interval of house arrest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, aah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she heard those words, Mikie lost her strength on her knees and collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she immediately swung her head, and took out a brown envelope with the words "Letter of Resignation" from her pocket, and slammed it on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, now that things has ended like this, I will also quit this job~kyuu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mike, you didn't say it properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mily stroke Mikie's back as if she was calming an animal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, calm down and repeat after what Origami said just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…? It's because Origami-san is getting 2 months of house arrest… Eh? Arere? House arrest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikie wiped her tears with her sleeves and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hou, house arrest, which means you don't have to quit right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Mikie's face which was dyed in despair immediately turned bright.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tha, that's great…!If Origami-san was to get dismissed then I…</p>
<p class="null-p">I…uh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The tears that were wiped away, was once again floating in Mikie's eyes. Mikie, then overpowered with emotions, spread her arms and jumped at Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami- Saaaan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Origami did not respond accordingly, and in order to ward off that small physique coming her way, she instantly twisted her body, and because of the height difference, she was able to give an elbow to the back of the incoming target's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was not like she had the intention to attack her but, the feelings that were carved right into her body, was just an overreaction to the opponent that was coming right at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hebuuu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She raised a strange shout, *Slam*! Mikie got her face vigorously hit to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O, Origami-saan…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I will get surprised if you come like that so suddenly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,No way…Just now, wasn't that a nice emotional scene…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikie was rubbing her red nose and forehead while, slurping her snot.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, while looking at that Mikie with a sidelong glance, Ryouko bent down and picked up the brown envelope that was on the corridor floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu-un…So you want to quit the AST. I guess there is no choice. Although it hurts since we are running out of help, since you were polite enough to prepare something like this, I guess I can't coldly reject the offer huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">She made an exaggerated gesture and shrugged her shoulders, then showed a sigh as if it was done on purpose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one that raised that hysteric voice was obviously Mikie. Her eyes turned swirly with circles and then ran to Ryouko in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, err! That was…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm‐? Yes~. What's wrong Mike? … Aah, sorry for calling you in an overly familiar way, Takamine-san. Don't worry, if it is you, you will most likely do well in your life from now on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Captain, tha-that's a mistake! That's a mistakeee!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikie extended her hands to take back the resignation letter. But, just when she was about to take it, Ryouko held the resignation letter high up with her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tha-that was some kind of a misunderstanding! That was a plot of an evil organization!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Misunderstanding huh…Even though this was written by you."</p>
<p class="null-p">*Hop**Hop* Mikie matched the timing to jump, while Ryouko was held the resignation letter further up each time she jumped to avoid it being taken.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was clear that she was playing. Although it was a rare action for the overly serious Ryouko but…There might have been accumulated stress from just now, so she was just releasing all of it by teasing Mikie with her whole body.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Origami was staring at Ryouko as always, *ahaha* Mily made a cheerful laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, both of you, it's a happy thing that Origami didn't have to get fired…but it's amazing how you managed to get only a 2 month house arrest. Honestly speaking, I didn't think of anything else is possible other than a dismissal."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, wondering where to start, had a problem explaining it. Mily immediately started trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!,Do-dododododon't tell me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mildred?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that she was strange, Origami called her name. But Mily completely did not realize that and blushed; sweat was then running down her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking normally, that act is a punishable class deplorable act…but, what was sentenced to Origaimi was a house arrest…that punishment is unnaturally light…in a dark room…and the lustful smiles of the superior officers…"You don't want to be fired right? Then you should know what to do to avoid that right?"…Ah~, Origami is then made to wear humiliating clothes and to grovel on the ground, and then her maiden part where no one has ever seen‐"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Hey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyann!"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Bam* And Ryouko's fist swung down on Mily's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what was that for! Mily's brain is everyone's treasure you know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! All of the things you were thinking about were leaking out of your mouth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, it was leaking out…Don't tell me you're forcing that maniacal play on me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">One more time, Ryouko's fist swung down on Mily's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch ouch ouch…mouu, is Ryouko going to take responsibility if I get dumb‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's already festered you Mimidoshima"5A 1"."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Ryouko was in a given up state and opening her fist, Mily was rubbing her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment, from the corridor, the sound of 2 person's footsteps echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they turned their sights towards that direction, they saw a man with a black suit, and a girl wearing sunglasses. She was Isaac Westcott's secretary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">*lower* Origami lowered her head. Looking at what Origami was doing, the others seem to have realized Westcott's existence. At that moment, they shut their mouth, stopped fooling around and stood upright.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott realized the gang and moved his eyebrows, and the moment he passed Origami's side, he placed his hands on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have expectations for you, young Wizard. If it is you, you will definitely shoot down the Spirits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not like she felt hostility or killing intent. But, Origami's heart was unbelievably contracting over and over again which was thought to be impossible. It was like‐she felt something like fear from the man that passed by her a moment ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give her that."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Westcott said that, his secretary took a small piece of paper out of her pocket, and handed it to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">She took it without saying anything. Over there was the name I.R.P.Westcott, a list of numbers that looked like phone numbers and a mail address was written there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you have anything that is troubling you, you can call us anytime you like ‐DEUS.EX.MACHINA , will not spare any efforts in helping your cause."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I am thankful."</p>
<p class="null-p">She took the business card and replied softly. But eventually, she could no longer stare back at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether or not he realized what Origami's state was going through, after Westcott made a smile, he then accompanied his secretary and walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E,errr…Who was that person just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikie and Mily was, tilting their heads exactly at the same timing. Ryouko who was making a nervous expression was now scratching her head as if she'd given up, she then faced to the both of them with half her eyes closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the DEM Company's Mr.Westcott. Haven't you seen him on television or magazines?…It's still understandable for Mikie but Mily, Didn't you transfer here from DEM? How come you didn't know that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The DEM Company is the only one in the world that could manufacture the Realizer, the CR-unit's vital part.</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to that, the countries' police organizations or the army which are supplied with the Realizers, would have supervisors or maintenance officials deployed by the DEM company. Mily is also one of those personnel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah" Mily touched her chin with her fingers from hearing Ryouko's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I think about it, there might be someone like that-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that I think about it…Isn't he your boss from your place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, that's because there rarely are chances for mechanics and managers to meet face to face‐. Anyone would be satisfied if the management ranks were keeping quiet while sending out money to Mily and the others anyway‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You made a dangerous remark so easily."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko made a dry smile, but Origami did not hear much of that conversational exchange.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked at the business card that was left on her hand as if glaring at the words and numbers printed on it‐then moistens her throat with her saliva, once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott was making echoes with his footsteps in the corridor, while making a soft sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you see that, Ellen? Everyone there did not see how grave that matter was. All of the incompetent fools joined together, were weird enough to put the blame on a genius that is 1 in 10,000."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess that's true."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was walking behind a few steps before Westcott while the girl‐Ellen replied back quietly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, for an unpurified Wizard to move the 'White Licorice'… If by any chance that Kiritani still does not want to withdraw Tobiichi Origami's punishment, it might have been better if I invited her to my company. The meaning of that, it'll be a little regretful to give up on her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"To the DEM?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. If a magic treatment was carefully conducted, compared to Mana or Artemishia, she might even become a Wizard that could surpass the world's strongest Wizard, Ellen Mathers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott said that while narrowing his eyes while the world's strongest Wizard kept silent. Although he planned it to be a joke, she might have turned a little sullen at it. Westcott thought that she was unbearably cute, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Ellen immediately remembered something and raised her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, there was one report."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that, Ellen opened the file she was holding with her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Report?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The AAA Spirit code-name 'Princess' that often appears in the Kantou vicinity, has stopped being confirmed appearing since 3 months ago, I told you this before a few days ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I heard, but that isn't really rare right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. But, look at this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen took a photograph, and showed it to Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were two girls in the photograph. One of them was First Lieutenant Tobiichi Origami they met earlier. Thinking about now, he heard that she was a reserve member for the AST while half of her time was spent going to school.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐the problem was the other girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was girl with a slender figure, wearing the same uniform as Origami. She had a beautiful appearance, with night colored hair reaching to her hips. A pair of fantasy like crystal eyes, that if anyone were to see it once, would probably never forget about it for the rest their lives.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no mistake. There is no way to mistake it. That was,</p>
<p class="null-p">"…The 'Princess'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Westcott was regulating his heart that has been beating fast, he made a soft voice and said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. The person being shown there was, the Spirit 'Princess' that they were talking about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does this mean? Are you saying that Spirit is using a high level skill to attend school?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Westcott said that while frowning, Ellen opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This girl's name is Yatogami Tohka. It looks like she is a female student who transferred to the Metropolitan Raizen High school, around the period when 'Princess's figure faded."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was the JGDSF's action?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like First Lieutenant Tobiichi reported a female student that resembled the Spirit but because the observation results show no Spirit readings from her, she was classified as a normal person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How was she observed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"An outside observation from the DS-06."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the name of the observation machine used, Westcott placed his right hand on his forehand and made a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They used the low accuracy vehicle type DS-06 once and they decided that she's just another person that just resembles the Spirit, just like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ellen, with this I am certain. A peace-loving idiot is much scarier than anyone with dementia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll urgently request for a re-investigation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Westcott extended his hands to restrain Ellen from doing so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we leave it to those kind of JGSDF VIPs, the best they could do would be a physical examination with the same results."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, we are going take this matter into our own hands. With us doing it, we can definitely solve this quickly and easily."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He stopped Ellen from saying anything further. He understood what she was going to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as Miss Yatogami Tohka has a chance of being a Spirit, it is necessary to prepare the required battle potential to oppose her if she shows her true colors.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, to have enough personnel and equipment to oppose an AAA rank Spirit and use it on the scene, is unbearably difficult hide from the AST.</p>
<p class="null-p">The point is, the situation now was like having a feast placed in front of you, but your hands cannot reach it. He was also thinking of re-requesting the AST to let Ellen enter the JGSDF again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Could you let me see that for a little longer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott pointed his fingers to Ellen's hands, and after making a short reply, she handed the file to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then flipped through the book and‐the side of Westcott's lips distorted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Houu…Isn't this a great timing…Hey Ellen, did your body turn dull recently for not having any Spirits be your opponent lately?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He said that, and Ellen twitched her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirits appear in unexpected places and in unexpected moments by their whims. There is a limit on preparing the strongest battle potential when it appears whenever it likes, if by any chance they get to drive a Spirit to a corner, it'll be meaningless if it goes "Lost".</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if they know about the whereabouts of the Spirit, the way to do it was simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll leave this matter to you Ellen. ‐Ellen. Ellen Mira Mathers. The strongest Wizard that is second to none. If it is you, you'll definitely be able to accomplish it. No matter whom the opponent is, even if it is the being that causes the atrocity of destroying the world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen made one clap before answering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is a given. No matter who the opponent is, I will never lose."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an expected answer that fit his expectations. *hmhm* Westcott made a pleasant smile.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a short breath, Takamiya Mana slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It might have been because she had not been using her eyes for a long time, but her vision was blurry like a mosaic.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could not properly exert strength with her body, and her whole body ache with a dull pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where…am I…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In one moment, the voice she made with her throat, sounded like someone she didn't know. Her dry throat and the buzz in her eardrums. Those factors were enough for her to not recognize her own voice. The only other thing left was her own brain, which could probably could not recognize her own voice. That type of stupid thought passed through her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a few seconds, Mana came to her senses, and confirmed the situation that she was in.</p>
<p class="null-p">A white room. A large bed. Her whole body was wrapped in bandages, her left arm had drips attached to it and her mouth was attached to an oxygen mask.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were electrodes stuck onto her chest, and the Electro-Cardiogram matching with Mana's heartbeat was ringing regularly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana unintentionally made a dry smile. No matter how she looked at it, she was a patient in a critical condition.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why am, I, in such a…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said up to there, and Mana opened her eyes wide. She tore off the oxygen mask, and raised her pain stricken body.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then turned her neck, and turned her eyes to the digital clock placed on a shelf.</p>
<p class="null-p">14:00 7/5 WED.</p>
<p class="null-p">"July…fifth…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the date displayed on it, Mana gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either the clock was broken or someone wanted to deceive Mana by intentionally changing the date, if that is not the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost a month had passed from the day Mana fought with 'Nightmare'‐Tokisaki Kurumi on the rooftop of Raizen High school.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. At that time, Mana was defeated and driven away by the real Kurumi whom had manifested her angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only other people that were at that place with Kurumi and Mana were, Shidou, Tohka and Origami only these three. She thought that, there was probably no one that was able to overturn that situation. Namely to say that means…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onii-sama…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana forcefully pulled out the electrodes stuck to her chest and the drip that was poking into her left arm. The second she did that, the Electro-Cardiogram disordered and *Piiiiii*, and such a sound rang.</p>
<p class="null-p">And finally at that moment, Mana realized something basic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why am…I, not dead…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was certain that her body hurt. Her vision was hazy. It was hard to say that her whole body's senses were in perfect condition.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐She was alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was exposed, defenseless, to that man-eater 'Nightmare', yet she still survived.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which means, the situation became unnecessarily incomprehensible. By the time Mana lost consciousness, the battle situation was at it's worst possible state.</p>
<p class="null-p">On top of the school's rooftop, inside the deepest part of Kurumi's duplication, her Angel that controls time was enshrined there.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a despair-like situation that anyone can see from just one look. There is probably no battle potential that exists in this world, that can defeat that monster.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if that was the case, it still does not explain why she is still alive.‐Unless that perverted woman decided not to exact her revenge, with a reason like it was her own whim that chose not to do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana placed her hands on her aching head. Even if she was still alive, she didn't not know, whether or not the others were out of danger. What on earth happened to everyone there?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And‐Mana, who was immersing herself in her thoughts, made that unexpected noise while raising her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">The door of the sickroom opened, and a few of people wearing black suits entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takamiya Mana, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Who are all you people? You people are a little dark for a doctor or a nurse."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana made a sharp gaze, and the men in black did not move an inch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You will come with us. Although we do not want to resort to violence, if you were to resist, we would have no choice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Aah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mana distorted her face in a bad mood, and glared at the man that said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you know who you are talking to? Resort to violence? Against me? Haa, Try it if you like."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that and stood up, and shaking her wrists to get accustomed to her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Takamiya-san, is there something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The nurse opened the sickroom door ‐and froze in her place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She saw some problems with Takamiya Mana's Electro-Cardiogram and came to check but…the room right now, was empty.</p>
<p class="null-p">On top of the disarranged bed, the removed oxygen mask and the electrodes, the drips from the needle were scattered around, and a small impression was left on the bed as if someone was just sleeping on it just a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, whether she turned her head to the left or right, or even looked under the bed, she could not find the supposedly unconscious patient in the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">The nurse rushed over to the pillow side of the bed, and pushed the button to call the nurse.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"Its over‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time when chime of the bell that he was used to hearing echoed in the school area, Itsuka Shidou fell onto the table as he used up all his energy. There is probably smoke coming out of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was only normal. That is because Shidou was right now, he has just finished his end-term exam, one of school-life's formidable enemies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay Okay, don't slacken up yet. Please stack the answer sheets starting from the back."</p>
<p class="null-p">*clap* *clap* the teacher with glasses standing at the teacher's desk raised her voice and clapped her hands. She was the class' homeroom teacher, Okamine Tamae, nicknamed Tama-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">The students raised their bodies like zombies and passed their sheets to the seats in front of them in sequence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Shidou felt that the zombie modes of the other classmates were stronger than average but, that was also normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition to the fact that this was an exam with a wide variety of topics, just a few days ago all the students in this school were sent to the hospital at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the end of last month, there was a case where, the students and staff members that were in the Raizen school, all collapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a thorough investigation from the schools gas pipes to building materials, and the foreign substance that was released from gas, the school's temporary closing was called off but…mercilessly, the schedule for the end term examination's did not move even one day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, during the time he placed his answer sheet onto the stack of other answer sheets and passed it to the front, he happened to see the girl who was sitting to his right. Just like what Shidou did a few moments before, *fell* on the desk, she threw herself on top of the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka, are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"u, umu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou tried to talk to her, Tohka raised her head dizzily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did it go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"mu…muu, it's just alright"</p>
<p class="null-p">With an exhausted face, Tohka fluttered her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the mid-term test before, she was the girl that only scribbled in the answering sheet (Reine made preparations in secret to make sure Tohka didn't get a red mark) but, after hearing the meaning of a test, she said that she was willing to do her best and started studying. It seemed like, she didn't like the fact that Shidou was studying while she did nothing at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that in on the 'Ratatoskr' , they also wished that Tohka would voluntarily take that action, there was a study meet planned in the Itsuka house before the test but…as expected she had most of her energy drained from doing something she was not used to.</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, one hour into the study meet she started getting a fever. It was a real fever that brings an intellectual growth spurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, now then, all the subjects in one end-term examination, are now over. Good work everyone"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan raised her voice. And the sound of cheers and breaths of relief came from inside the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, since there are some things still left for today, all of you must not go back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan said it to make sure and arranged the stack of answer sheets before leaving the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, matching with that, Tohka wobbly stood up from her chair all and dried up. "shidou…let me drink, some water"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O,Ou. Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu…don't worry about it. I'm just a little tired"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said and stumbled to the classroom door with tired footwork, she then opened the door and walked into the corridor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha…well, she did try hard after all"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou sighed after seeing off Tohka's back, and then leaned back in to his chair‐*twitch* he then twitched his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. The image of the female student sitting at his left side entered the side of his view.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a girl with white colored hair that stopped and tickled the tip of her shoulders. And because her head was turning left‐and looking at towards the windows, although he couldn't catch a glimpse at her face but, he could imagine that there was not a single sign of expression on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tobiichi Origami. She was Shidou's classmate and a member of AST; an organization that hunts down Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…u"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he did not do anything at all, there was a creaky pain on his heart. He unintentionally distorted his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the end of last month's events, Shidou had not spoken to Origami at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, if he were to let this chance get away, he felt that he would miss the chance to have a conversation with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He gathered his resolve and opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O…Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou called her name, Origami twitched her shoulders a little before turning towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"what"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, with her usual soft and accent-less voice, she replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wondered why, but he was a little relieved looking at Origami's state.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, after she stopped talking, there was silence between Shidou and Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"e,errrr"</p>
<p class="null-p">It can't be helped if she wants to keep quiet like this. Shidou was trying to ask her about what happened after the last event that occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, as expected he could not have that kind of conversation in the classroom where the other classmates could overhear them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fortunately there was some time left until homeroom started, and Tohka had stepped out of her seat. After Shidou swallowed the saliva in his throat, he once again opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami. Can we go to a place where both of us can be alone for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the time Shidou said that, Origami moved her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A place, where both of us‐ can be alone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And for some reason, she said it with the words separated from one another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. Look, even on the stairs where we had our last talk would be oka‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"come"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami stood up straight, and just like that she grabbed Shidou's hand with all her strength and walked out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O,oi, Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he called Origami's name she didn't reply. Without even looking at the stairs that lead to the roof, their footsteps echoed in the deepest part of the school building where no one was around.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then just like that, Origami walked towards the girls' washroom located at the end of the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, stop for a bit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time Shidou finished talking and swung his hands, Origami tilted her head in curiosity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since this place is quite far from the classrooms, there won't be anyone coming here during test time"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that might the case but even so!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do not worry"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai, Sto‐no seriously, where are you planning to bring me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no point in resisting. With Shidou hands being pulled, he was then brought to the furthest toilet cubicle just like that, and *Kachin* the door was locked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…errrr"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was facing Origami in this space that was obviously not supposed to be for more than 2 people, Sweat dripped down Shidou's cheeks. And, at the edge of his vision, it seemed that Origami had starting to move around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami, what are you‐" He said, and gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was only normal. When he thought that Origami used both her hands and inserted them into the inside of the sides of her skirt, and just like that she pushed her white underwear halfway down her legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai, Wait a second! STOP! I'll wait outside if you are planning to do your business!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Origami tilted her head and made a face that Shidou's reaction was out of her expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then *Pon* she clapped her hands together, and pulled back her underwear back up, this time she crouched down. And then extended her hands towards Shidou's waist, *Kachin**Kachin* she then unfastened the metal fittings of his belt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hii! He gasped, and grabbed both of Origami arms in a panic to stop her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing! What are you doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Then, why did you bringing me to a place like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the one that brought me here Origami-san, right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was shouting while almost crying, but somehow he managed to adjust his breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I…just want, to talk about the matter regarding last month"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, it was as if Origami came to terms with that but, and for some reason she made a regretful face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What did you thought I was going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected you don't have to say it, I'm sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami stood up straight and looked at Shidou's face, and quietly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"the results of the interrogation, I have been sentenced to 2 months of house arrest"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is about the thing after that event"</p>
<p class="null-p">"House arrest…which means, you don't have to quit the AST!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou spoke in a surprised voice, Origami tilted her head to the front in silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…you didn't get fired huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">He placed his hands on his chest, and made a sigh of relief. When he did that, Origami rocked her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you react like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no…it's certain, that it is true. I wonder why too" Shidou said that, and scratched his head, troubled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou supposedly didn't want Origami to fight the Spirits. If it was possible, he wished that she would pull out from the AST, but even so.</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, the moment he heard those words from from Origami's mouth, he was a little relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"it's not like I have come to terms with it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Origami's words, he gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was probably because he guessed what she was going to say in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fire Spirit, 'Ifreet'. You said that she was not the Spirit that killed both my parents. ‐However, there is no, definite evidence that proves it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"… that is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">To kill the Spirit that killed her parents, Origami enlisted in the AST.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last month. She finally faced the Spirit that she thought was the target of her revenge. It was Shidou's sister‐Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">And of course, Origami threw everything away and even violated the laws and regulations, just to attack and kill Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at that moment, Shidou remembered his past. The memories he had from 5 years ago. The image of the city being covered in flames. And the‐the presence of another Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is true that it might be that case. But…I want you to believe me. I will never lie to‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't mistake me. It's not like I don't believe what Shidou said. I want to believe, in what you said. ‐and also, if I had to say then, I think I want what you said to be true"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If possible I also don't want to kill your sister"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou opened his eyes wide in an instant, she gripped his fist hard and he lowered his head a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is, my line"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, once again averted her eyes, and said that. Not knowing her intentions, Shidou made a faint frown.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami slowly adjusted her glance back to its normal place, she moved her mouth with a bit of hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm thankful… for, you talking to me normally"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no, you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the human that tried to kill your sister. ‐No, even before 3 months ago, I was almost about to kill you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a sour face as if he was chewing something, and scratched his head in a mess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry about it…and I can't say something like that. But‐even so, Origami, is the thought of talking to you like I always do‐is it no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked that, for a moment, Origami showed something like hesitation before, *Swing**swing* swinging her head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou folded his hands together and once again tilted his head forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, how about going back to the classroom soon. Homeroom is going to start soon too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"wait. There is one more last thing that I want to confirm with you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou adjusted his posture by turning to face backwards and said that, Origami stared at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou. Are you, human?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">He unintentionally shortened his words. ‐but, he had pretty much predicted that question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From before, I felt it was a little weird. At that time, there was no mistake that I shot you… however, after a few days, you came to school with not even a single scratch. And also‐ during that time at the amusement park"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. On the day that Origami assaulted Kotori. Shidou sealed Kotori's Reiryoku, and on top of showed Origami his regenerative abilities, he also told her that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori now is human, and 'Ifreet's power is with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why; if you are going to target someone, then target me instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it, Shidou was quite reckless at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although there was no other choice but to persuade Origami, he had just exposed his secret to her, a member of the AST which opposes the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami probably guessed his thoughts by looking at his expression; she opened her mouth without waiting for Shidou words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Relax. I did not report that to the higher ups."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he asked her, Origami was mostly nodding at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, why would…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't just leak out uncertain information and cause confusion among the team members. And also, if by any chance you are confirmed as a Spirit, there is a chance that there will be a suppression order against you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Heartbeat*His heart made a huge beat. Suppression order. There is only one thing that word meant. Which means‐the AST will, the modern day Wizards covered in mechanical armor will, using their entire powers come to kill Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was a reasonable matter. That's because, he can seal the Spirits' power, and although it was just a little portion of it, he was able to use some of that power. It is not surprising that would conclude that he is a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"I…am human. At the very least, I think I am."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou unintentionally expressed what Kotori usual said but, there was no other way to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…you don't doubt it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you before, I want to believe the words you say"</p>
<p class="null-p">She turned her neck a bit to peek at Shidou's face, and then continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someday, if the time comes where you feel like telling me the truth, I hope you would tell me in better detail."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry. Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Origami opened the cubicle door and then exited the washroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">A moment later, Shidou realized that he was left alone in an unbelievably dangerous zone, while relentlessly looking around to examine the surroundings; he hurried and ran out of the washroom. But, when was about to return back to the classroom, he followed Origami and walked in to the corridor,</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the sound of a doubtful Tohka coming from behind, Shidou twitched his shoulders out of surpirse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To,Tohka…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed like Tohka had finished getting a drink and was suspiciously alternating between looking at Shidou and Origami, she continued talking while making a grim face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Why did shidou and Tobiichi Origami, come out from the female</p>
<p class="null-p">toilet?", "guh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, sweat gushed out of his face. They had been completely discovered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no, that is…errr…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tried explaining the situation to her but; there were already stares from the other students appearing around them. He can't say anything untactful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, while being silent, Origami gave a meaningful eye signal to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that just now! What on earth did the both of you do!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not telling. This is a secret between the two of us"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,What did you say!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami stood one of her index fingers up and brought it to the front of her nose. Looking at that comical gesture that was unusual from Origami, Tohka widened her eyes and shouted. Immediately, she shot a sharp gaze in Shidou's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou! What were the both of you doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? No…errr, it's about"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou uncomfortably scratched his head. Although he didn't mind sharing it with Tohka but…having 40 weak students gathering at the classroom windows, he was reluctant to continue with the conversation just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Sorry, I'll see you later"</p>
<p class="null-p">"!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With no other choice Shidou lowered his head, and Tohka made a shocked expression and collapsed to the ground after a dramatic "GAN!" effect appeared behind her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To,Tohka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu,uuuuuuuuuuuu…why is it, why is Tobiichi Origami okay, but I'm</p>
<p class="null-p">not…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She groaned in frustration, and clenched her teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ca,calm down! Later! I'll tell you all about it later!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Re,really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really! Really!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her legs folded and fallen on her knees, when he appealed to her by having his hands in panic, he somehow managed to raise Tohka's anxious face up, but.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…can't say. It's because I was made to do something like that" From Origami words, Tohka's eyes widen in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"shi,shidou…? What on earth, did you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, he could hear the sounds of whispers coming from around him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ee‐…Itsuka-kun's the worst", "It's the first time I saw Tobiichi-san make that kind of face…", "What are you doing in the school in this clear afternoon", "Although you have someone like Tohka-chan you still…", "Damn it…damn it…", "Hey was poison in the acidic group or the chlorine?", "Hurry up and request hymn number 13"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I didn't do anything to her! And the second half! What are you trying to do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He raised a voice filled with excuses. However, the persistent stares coming from around did not completely stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at that moment, he heard the sound of the classroom door opening coming from behind him, and Tama-chan appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, okay, please get back to your seats. Homeroom is about to start"</p>
<p class="null-p">"!, Loo,look Tohka! Go back to your seat for now! Okay!? Everyone too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a help from the heavens above. Shidou made unnecessary loud shouts, and took the initiatives by himself before sitting down on his chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone had something to say but, it couldn't be helped since the had teacher arrived, so they returned to their respective seats.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka "…you have to fill me in on the details later" was saying that before sitting on her spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking at the situation, Tama-chan let a giggle leak out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara‐, looks like you were having fun. What were you doing with everyone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing, don't worry about it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was saying that with sweat oozing out, Tama-chan "Ara ara" made a happy laugh before standing at the teachers' seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, I am going to start the returning homeroom now. But before that, there is something we have to decide first"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes~ what are going to be deciding?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tonomachi raised his hands up high, and threw a question. Tama-chan made a small nod before continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Assigning the class groups for the school trip, and the seating arrangement in the airplane"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Tama-chan said that, Shidou raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, the middle of July was‐just before summer holidays, there was the school trip to Okinawa waiting for them.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the mass unconsciousness incident to the end-term examination. And because of various matters regarding the Spirits, he had totally forgotten about this school life's greatest event.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless, it looked like Shidou was not the only one. Around one third of the class, "Ahh‐…now that you mention it" nodded just like Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"fufufu, everyone's so forgetful huh~. Now, let's hurry and‐oh, yeah"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, Tama-chan, folded up her eyebrows as if she remembered something, and took out a printout that was placed in the attendance book.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before that. ‐the location for school trip this time has been changed"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The voices in the classroom beautifully piled up.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was only normal. That's because there was only half a month left before the school trip. To suddenly change the location of the trip at the last minute was unheard of.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…well it seems that would be the case"</p>
<p class="null-p">"errrrr, so, what did they change the location to?" Once again, Tonomachi threw a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Although he was a little curious as to why the location was changed so suddenly but…the most important matter to everyone was the location.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because the original destination was Okinawa. Travelling to a welcoming paradise with coral reefs, blue sea and white sandy beaches, and while munching on Okinawa sweets and Saatandagi. There were probably many girls that had bought brand new swimsuits for this occasion. If the location was changed to a nonbeach area in Japan, jokes aside a riot might occur.</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably feeling the unrest from the atmosphere with her skin, Tama-chan continued with a nervous voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do,do not worry. The changed location is also, a fantastic place too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why in the end, where is that location?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err…it's Arubi Island"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tama-chan let out that name, around half of the class went "ahh‐…"And raised an "I see" voice, the other half tilted their heads.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of Arubi Island… That's towards Izu's direction right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The heck, it became a nearby area. It's a Grade down huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you can't say that's true. It's not that bad if its sightseeing"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, okay! Please keep quiet"</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to silence the suddenly noisy classroom, Tama-chan clapped her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">In every corner of the class, "Well let's just say that the ocean disappeared for now…" under such ideas, everyone followed the teachers instructions quietly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can read the revised guidelines with the explanations for the minor details by yourself after it is done, for now let's decide how the class will be separated. Please make groups of 4 to 5 with the people you like"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tama-chan gave that order, everyone shifted their sights and examined the surroundings before, *Gata gata* standing up and making a group with their closest friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">In Shidou's case too, Tonomachi was walking to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ou Itsuka, the class group‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Tonomachi's voice was, drowned out by the shout coming from Shidou's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka leaned forward from the desk with her eyes sparkling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That class group or something, lets group together!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…eeh?</p>
<p class="null-p">He unintentionally frowned, and accidentally let out a hysteric voice. But Tohka, tilted her head in curiosity, not knowing why Shidou was shocked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, as expected that is kind of bad"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is that? 5 people in a group right? Then there isn't problem at all", "Y,you can't Yatogami-san. Please group the boys separately from the girls!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably hearing the conversation, Tama-chan shouted from the teacher's desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu…why is that? I'd prefer to be with Shidou though"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W,why is it…err"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan's face turn as red as a ground cherry and *Mumble**mumble* mumbled something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a sigh and then fixed back to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't trouble sensei too much. Anyway, it's no good if the group is not separated to boys and girls"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu…I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's shoulders drooped down in disappointment. But, she immediately raised her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! I know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said that, and ran out of the classroom. And after closing the door with a slam,*Gata**gata* the sound of a locker from the corridor being fiddled with echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">After around one minute, the classroom door opened again, and Tohka entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka wore a jersey as a substitute for the skirt, and her hair was tied up. "…Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wrong. I‐I am, To…ou, yes, Touru"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou called her name for some reason Tohka replied back with an intentionally low voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">He guessed what Tohka's intentions were, it was…</p>
<p class="null-p">"So because of that. Tama-chan sensei. I'm a boy from now on. There's no problem with that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes there is!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan shouted with the feeling of not accumulating enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu…this is still no good huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With an exhausted face Tohka curled her back disappointed. And,</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"wait"</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment an unexpected person came to help Tohka. It was Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wish you would approve Yatogami Tohka's excuse. Please be flexible and support her"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…eehhh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the remark of the person that had such a strained relationship with Tohka, the teacher Tama-chan made a shocked expression. No, sensei was not the only one. The other classmates that were used to seeing them bicker, also made shocked faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You…whats your goal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have learned the deep impression of your unyielding spirit. You have the right to enter a boys group"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Tohka was looking at Origami with her eyes half closed to be alert but, after few seconds, *Fuun* she blew her nose and looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…i,I won't say thanks"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai,wait wait! Why are you two continuing with this conversation! That's no good right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The teacher Tama-chan immediately slammed the teachers' desk, to control the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami continued on without showing much attention of bothering about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, as long as you are attending the school trip as a male, you have to properly follow the rules"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rules?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Whether it's the toilet or entering the bath, all of it you will be together with the boys"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oooh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka gasped and her face was beet red, the same time with that the guys all together started getting excited. To those guys, the other female groups were quietly looking at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, whether if your body is being stared at or, you were to stimulate something, that is the law. That's because you are a boy"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whawhawhawha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's hands trembled, and glared at Origami with her face being close to crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami payed no heed to that, and shifted her glance to Shidou's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, since one girl has become a boy this has caused a serious irregularity. There is a clear need for a replacement"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…? What do you mean by…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since there the number of boys has increased, there is no one else but Shidou to be a girl"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No I don't understand the meaning of that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's wash each other, Shidomi"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that my name!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou could not take it and shouted. The surrounding classmates that were making the face, since honor student Origami is saying this so it should be true, as expected "Hmmm?" they as also tilted their heads in wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment Tohka, for some reason was placing her hands on her chin was swimming in thoughts, opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a sec! If Shidou becomes a girl, doesn't that make us unable to make a group!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can go on living your life strongly as a boy. I'll cheer for you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U, Unuuu, you tricked me, Tobiichi Origami!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah calm down already! Anyway, boys and girls are in separate groups! Gender switching is also forbidden!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou made the loudest voice he has done, the both of them finally kept quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing them calm down just in case, the teacher Tama-chan pat her chest in relief. But‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"We,well, although you can't be in the same group but, the arrangement for the airplane seats is free. If that is case, it's okay for you to sit together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Tama-chan said something unnecessary, both Tohka and Origami's eyes shone again.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: Cyclone Girls</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"A School trip? Aah, I heard about it. It's in Okinawa right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Itsuka Kotori was on the bridge of the flying airship 'Fraxinus', moving the rod of the Chupa Chups in her mouth while responding to the report coming from her subordinate.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a girl with her long hair tied in two with a black ribbon, and a crimson jacket was placed over her shoulders. She had round eyes like an acorn. Her facial features were still childish. No matter how much you look at it, she was a young girl that was not suitable to be in a place like the bridge of an airship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, the planned location was changed in a hurry. The destination is now Arubi Island"</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman wearing an army uniform with thick shadows under her eyes‐Murasame Reine was, swinging her head around as if she was drunk while continuing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A change? At a time like this? Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Aah. A month ago, a travelling company called Cross Travel contacted the school authorities. It would seem they said that for the sake of the PR sightseeing, they would randomly pick a school, and give them invitations to the island. Although there is a condition of them taking photo's for their pamphlet, it looks like all of the school trip expenses are paid by the company's funds"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha‐, they are quite generous aren't they… But, no matter how good the conditions are, is it okay for them to suddenly change the location at the last moment like that. Something like the lodging place was also decided right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It would seem that, the Inn the school booked got crushed and it became unable to be used. And because of that, when the proposal came the school authorities flew to it immediately"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Crushed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not a peaceful talk. Kotori frowned doubtfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Aah. Although I don't know the full details but, I'm afraid the reason is probably due to aging"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun… Well, although I feel that the timing is too good…isn't it okay if the latter party is okay with it? How about Reine go and release some stress too"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori made a small shrug with her shoulders while saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Murasame Reine, an analysis member of 'Ratatoskr organization', while at the same time she is also a vice-homeroom teacher for the 2nd year group 4 of the Raizen high school. It was planned that she will also be attending as a teacher for the school trip this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Reine suddenly lowered her face, and made a groan with a difficult face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, it would be good if I was thinking too much but, it seems that the travelling company Cross Travel‐by tracing back to its origin, is affiliated with DEM industries"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she heard that name, Kotori distorted her face in suspicion.</p>
<p class="null-p">DEUS. EX. MACHINA Industries. It is the world's leading giant corporate that has its headquarters set up in the United Kingdom, if Asgard Electronics, which is the motherly existence of 'Ratatoskr', is left out of the equation, it will be the only company in the world that has the ability to manufacture the Realizers.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, that organization has a principle that opposes Kotori and the team's 'Ratatoskr' which uses peaceful means to seal the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">This means, they directly eliminate the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…It smells suspicious, somehow"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori made the Chupa Chups rod stick out straight and made a deep wrinkle in between her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the many people of Raizen high school that was going on the school trip, Shidou and Tohka was joining them too. They probably aren't prepared for any worst case scenarios.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although it might just be a coincidence, I will have the 'Fraxinus' match its schedule to the trip on that day just in case. Well, it won't be a problem if we make it be able to move immediately when a crisis occurs, although it would probably be just like an essential holiday"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hmm, that's true. That might be good. If any problems happen, I will contact you on that area. It'll be okay if you stand-by until then"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How many days is the school trip again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…From the 17th of July, it'll be a 3 days 2 night stay"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Geh. Is that so? On that day, I will be heading to the headquarters. This is bad"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Kotori was placing her hands on her chin showing that she was troubled, coming from behind *Zan*, the sound of footstep echoed and a man with long hair appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">The 'Fraxinus' Vice-commander, Kannazuki Kyouhei, was making a refreshing smile while making his thumb stand out. His teeth that are despicably white glittered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I give up. What are you telling me to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Kotori, did not look over to him and continued her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Fumu, can't we just change the schedule?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's probably impossible. Days when the Rounds directly gather others, is something that only occurs once in a year"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kotori said that, Kannazuki that was standing behind her took a step forward, Kotori's felt like she heard dramatic sounds like "BOOOOOOOOOOM" or "Dodododododododo" coming from her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that so. If that's the case"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, there is no choice but to leave it to someone in the ship. If possible I would ask for Reine to do it but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I will also be directly attending too. It will also be bad if the contact personnel were gone from the area"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right. I wonder if there is anyone"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she sighed while mumbling, *Spin* *spin* Kannazuki came out dancing in front the both of them. And like a swan, he spreads both his hands with an elegant behavior‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're annoying"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eyes are particle beams!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori dented her eyeballs and on the spot he got hit by a somersault before he fell down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is wrong with you, wandering around randomly from just now. If you're practicing an original dance, how about doing it somewhere else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nonono, what are you saying. From what I have heard from the conversation, the commander is currently looking for a substitute to look after 'Fraxinus' while Shidou-kun is on his school trip"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki immediately spreads both his hands out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That heavy responsibility, is there any other humans that are more suitable than me! No there's none! Your response!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, if this is the case, as expected it would be Mikimoto or Kawagoe"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I wonder. Although they are excellent crew members, I wonder if they are able to take command"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ignore play! Is there something like that too"</p>
<p class="null-p">When they ignored him and continue on with their conversation, Kannazuki started making *haa**haa* excessive breaths. As expected since it was getting irritating, Kotori clicked her tongue followed by fixing her sights back at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…During the time I was gone before, I've heard that you were making quite a mess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay! Because at that time I only went PigBang towards commanders loveagape! Oink! There is no problem this time! I will show you, that I will certainly make sure to see Shidou-kun's one page of youth through!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Reine"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…well, I am also at that area anyway, it'll probably be fine"</p>
<p class="null-p">To brush away the feeling of uncertainty in her chest, Kotori *Haah* made a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">17th of July, Monday. After 3 hours of being rocked around in an airplane, Shidou and the other Raizen 2nd year group were floating above the Pacific Ocean and had reached the island.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O, ooh…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, who had exited the airport, jiggled both her hands with her eyes opened wide in wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it might be something that can't be helped. That was because right now, in her view, a spectacular scenery was spread out and it was impossible to grasp unless that person were to move their neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ocean was spreading out across the road and sand, the horizon was expanding out like it was separating the sky and the earth.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky was clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sun was pouring down magnificently, and painting the ocean with a beautiful gradation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-so this is the…Ocean!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She shouted, and as if she was trying to measure the size of it, she spreads her hands wide apart.</p>
<p class="null-p">But of course, the ocean was not that small, until it could fit into both her arms. What's more, in an excited state, she made her shoulders tremble a little and curved her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha…you're full of energy huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, Tohka probably has not seen the sea directly before. Shidou made a wry smile looking at Tohka's overly excited behavior while shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Arubi Island. It is located between the islands of Izu and Ogasawara; it was an island that had a total area of around 70 square kilometers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the consecutive Space Quakes from 30 years ago, the northern part of the island got scraped off. In the recent years it has been redeveloped into a new sightseeing spot. In a way it is a place that has a similar history to Tenguu City which Shidou and the others were living in.</p>
<p class="null-p">The perfectly re-established towns in the northern block area, and without the exception of other redeveloped areas, are all installed with anti-disaster measures. And again, the beauty and rarity of the beach that was beautifully scraped off by the Space Quake, Japan is also originally, a place that calls many foreign tourists to visit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it might be impudent if they think about the victims that lost their lives because of the Space Quake but…in this island that is continuing on with depopulation, it won't even be exaggerated to say that the Space Quake has accomplished to create a great tourist attraction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unn‐…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was not like Tohka, to Shidou he lacked the sensitivity to feel anything even by being in front of this superb view. He looked around the scenery, and took a good breath while stretching his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment unexpectedly, he leaked one yawn out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fua…aa"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was probably because the gathering time was early in the morning, his eyelids was oddly heavy. Even inside the airplane, he was almost close to sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, nonetheless…</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou swung his hands while still not excited, while sighing he took a glance at Tohka and Origami who were coming out from the entrance of the airport.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether it was fortunate or unfortunate, because the airplane seats are made to 3 in a row, leaving Shidou right in the middle following from left and right, he managed to get Tohka and Origami to sit at that arrangement but…</p>
<p class="null-p">(Shidou, look. The view is pretty)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Shidou! This side is pretty too‐achk! The window is far away!? Tobiichi Origami, you, tricked me!)</p>
<p class="null-p">(It's your own fault for not sending out an application to reserve the seat)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Gununu…)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Shidou. Look, you can see the horizon)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Kuh…, shi-shidou! Over here too, err, it's that! It's amazing! The airplane's pathway is so cool! The beauty of it can't be compared with the horizon!)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Look. You can see the mountain far away. Come closer)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Unuu…, even over here too…! shidou, look! There are gigantic mountains on Reine's chest!)</p>
<p class="null-p">(We passed the clouds. Look. The sea of clouds. The clouds look like a carpet)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ov,over here err…Uh,ugahhh!)</p>
<p class="null-p">…because of the racket made by the stereo-like voice, he couldn't sleep even if he wanted to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately, the Tohka that was making a ruckus made a weird voice and looked relentlessly around the area around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"?, what's wrong, Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…No, I felt something or someone was looking at me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, during the moment Shidou tilted his head, *Chick chak* that sound echoed, and the both of them were covered in a flash.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the sudden event, he unintentionally covered his face with his hands. When he looked towards the direction of light while narrowing his flickering eyes, he found a woman standing there making a stance with her huge camera.</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be called a Nordic blonde; she was a girl with a pale color blonde hair flying in the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had facial features that were clearly different from an Asian's and her white skin was her characteristic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err…is there something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked her while in a perplexed state, the girl lowered her camera and fixed her sights towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I apologize for the rudeness. I am called Ellen Mathers, an attendant cameraman called and deployed by Cross Travels. Starting from today for 3 days, I will be applying everyone's travelling records. ‐I apologize for the rude picture. Please allow me to apologize for hurting your feelings"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, no, it's not like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, he felt like he was told that a cameraman was going to be sent to take pictures for the trip. To think it was a foreigner‐and what's more, a girl that made him think she had an age that was not much different from Shidou and the group.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to have taken your time. Well then"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, after she looked at Shidou and Tohka's personal appearances with curiosity, Ellen made a bow once again, and walked towards everyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was up with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While folding her arms, Tohka tilted her head in wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder too…but, you were right about feeling someone was looking at you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu, umu"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that then turned her sights left and right, and for the ending she raised her head and faced upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…still, I feel there is still someone looking at me though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He raised his eyebrows at those words, and brought his eyes towards where Tohka was looking at but‐over there was, only the refreshing blue sky as if it were giving its blessing to Shidou and the group for their arrival.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"Telegrams received starting from Adeptus 1. The target has entered the island"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Camera number 6, north block, Akaru airport, target confirmed"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She is confirmed from here too. It's 'Princess'"</p>
<p class="null-p">The voices from the lower deck of a ship joined together and echoed, and on the monitor the figure of a girl was being shown.</p>
<p class="null-p">An AAA rank Spirit. Code name 'Princess', to the girl that holds quite a similar physique and appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"fumu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">DEM Industries' 500 meter class airship, the 'Arbatel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">A middle-aged man was sitting on the Captain's seat of the ship; he was making small nods while stroking the beard growing on his chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">James A Paddington. DEM industries second executive head for colonel, and also the captain for 'Arbatel' which was left to handle by Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is disappointing beyond expectations. Is that really a Spirit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please be careful not to let your guard down"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to answer his question, the voice of a young girl echoed from the speaker of the ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">Call sign Adeptus 1, DEM 2nd head executive that was directly at that area, it was Ellen's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She might be a Spirit. Just with that reason, it has enough reasons to be at Level 1 alert"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the right screen, Ellen was being shown on it and was the one saying that but, she replied back while shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will bear that in mind"</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably not satisfied with Paddington's response, Ellen slightly distorted her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…tsk"</p>
<p class="null-p">He clicked his tongue, just loud enough for Ellen to not hear it.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't care whether or not she was the strongest Wizard or whatever, but to be taking orders from a girl, whose age when compared to his was similar to that of a parent and a child, wasn't amusing at all. All the more, she was a woman that had rumors of being Westcott's mistress.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Paddington wasn't that incompetent to not understand the post and situation given to him. He planned not to be childish and use words with bad impression without any reasons. After clearing his throat, he replied back to the girl on the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what are we going to do now? It doesn't Matter if she's a Spirit. If it's the 'Bandersnatch' team, it should be no problem for them to secure one little girl right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is not simple as that. Let's go in carefully. First off, please turn off the radio wave transmission"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger. Perform a parallel start-up of 'Ashcroft- Beta' from machine numbers 25 to 40, activate the Permanent Territory. The target is‐Arubi Island's entire area"</p>
<p class="null-p">Responding to Paddington's voice, the crew moved their hands swiftly and operated the controls.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they did that, on the image of Arubi Island that was being shown on the screen, the sight of a thin dome being painted around the island with CG patterns could be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">It can't be detected by sight; it can't be matched even by touching it, an invisible wall. The Territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now the 'Arbatel' is floating 20000 meters above the sky of Arubi island.</p>
<p class="null-p">From there, using the Realizer 'Ashcroft-Beta' installed on the ship, the Territory used by them is in a scale where it can't be even compared to what the AST personals use, and that Territory is now activated around the entire around the whole island.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which means, transmission from outside or inside the island should no longer pass and only the communication machine prepared by Ellen and the group would work. With that done‐no matter what happens inside the Island, the AST won't be prying their hands into this matter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"and, speaking of which, how about that particular Wizard?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Paddington asked while stroking his chin. It's true that inside the same class as the target; there is a talk about one Wizard belonging to the AST is in it. Well, it would seems that she is forbidden from using the Realizer because of her current house arrest status, she does not pose a threat to them but…the problem is, that particular Wizard had encountered Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That shouldn't be a problem. Since our faces only met for a few seconds, and at that time I was wearing sunglasses. She doesn't seem to have realized‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, in the middle of the conversation Ellen's words got interrupted. When he looked at the monitor, it would seem that her face got covered by the sudden wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is everything alright, Miss executive chief?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. However…it's a little weird"</p>
<p class="null-p">After She said that, Ellen gazed at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Same time with that, the image that was being shown on the big monitor on the bridge started to have changes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Paddington unintentionally frowned his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason is simple. With a velocity that is normally not thinkable.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Sky, the cloud, as if it got whipped by an invisible arm, it started to whirl around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aahh mou, we got left by the others. Come on, let's hurry Tohka"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou started walking quickly while turning back, and then threw his voice towards Tohka who was still tilting her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, after that matter Tohka said that she was still bothered by it and went searching around, before they knew it their friends from school started to move.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…Sorry, but I really felt someone was looking at me"</p>
<p class="null-p">While jogging, Tohka said that to him apologetically. Shidou sighed as if he has given up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's obvious, that you're going to get looked at after making all that commotion"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu, is it something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said that as if she was groaning, and kept silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errr…if I'm clear it should be this way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He tried remembering the map he saw right before departure in his head, and moved left on a fork road. If I remember correctly, the museum we are supposed to visit first should be this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that time, he touched his right ear to confirm the small-scale In-cam he was wearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was told to wear it just in case Tohka's mood collapses in the middle of the trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looks like Kotori said she will be heading towards the Headquarters and won't be here for today but, 'Fraxinus' is floating above the island right now. In a worst case scenario, they probably won't get lost if Shidou were to contact them with the Incom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, he heard Tohka's suspicious voice coming from his back, Shidou stopped his legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he turned back, Tohka was again looking at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oi, stop playing around. No matter how many times you look‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's different. Don't you feel something is weird?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He said that and turned his eyes to the sky‐Shidou lost his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,what the heck…is that"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the sky, that was pretty and refreshing just a moment ago, were grey clouds starting to whirl around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gradually, at a frightening speed, the surroundings changed completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">The clear sky was filled with dark clouds. The calm wind turned into violent gales. The calm water surface turned into raging huge waves.</p>
<p class="null-p">In terms of time, probably only a minute passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within that time, the world around Shidou and the others drastically changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of wind rumbling the ground could be heard echoing in the surroundings. *Rustle**Rustle* The trees that were growing near the area shook about. The storm could be said to be the same level as a large-scale hurricane. A garbage bin probably got rolled over nearby, because newspaper and empty tin cans crossed by his sights.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou immediately grabbed Tohka's shoulder, and lowered her stance. If he didn't do that, they might have gotten blown away by the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What on earth‐is this…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He frowned his eyebrows while using his arms to cover his face</p>
<p class="null-p">According to the Weather Report, the weather should be clear for the entire duration of the school trip. Of course Shidou didn't take it as a 100% prediction but, no matter how you look at the situation, this is too weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka, are you okay!? It's dangerous so let's hurry to the museum‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou! Look out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, right in the middle of talking Tohka thrust away Shidou's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, a garbage bin made of metal flew towards them, and made a critical hit towards Tohka's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyapfuu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She let out such a comical voice and Tohka fell down on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oi ,oi Tohka! Tohka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He shouted in panic, and shakes her shoulders, but Tohka's eyes were completely spinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…I got no choice"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou in an exhausted state somehow managed to carry Tohka on his back, and walked towards the direction of the museum.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slowly, but with certainty, he advanced one leg at a time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're almost there, Tohka…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">and, wondering how long has passed when he started walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, unintentionally raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of the raging sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there, he saw 2 human-like shadows in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou suddenly gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">For human shadows to be flying in the sky, there are only 2 things that came into Shidou's Mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would either be Spirits, or AST Wizards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A bad feeling appeared in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a sudden outbreak of a big storm which is normally unthinkable under normal circumstances. If by any chance, this is something brought out by the power of the Spirit then‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but…the Space Quake alarm didn't ring at all. Then what on</p>
<p class="null-p">earth…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou encircle himself with thoughts for a few moments, he continued moving onwards on the route he planned out.</p>
<p class="null-p">If by any chance the human shadows really belong to Spirits then, he could not just leave it alone. But it's not like he has any proof for his claims and the most important matter right now is to move Tohka to a much safer place as he had planned before. He fixed the fainted Tohka properly on his back, before heading towards the museum.</p>
<p class="null-p">But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped. The shadows that were clashing with each other many times up in the sky, in that moment when both of the noticeable big shock waves clashed together, an extremely violent wind which could not be compared with the others blew towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"U, Uwah…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">To avoid getting blown away he stood firmly, and took a stance that curled his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the two shadows that were clashing up in the sky, blew each other away and both of them fell towards the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">both shadows fell just exactly to the left and right of Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweat was oozing out of Shidou's forehead. The nervous feeling made his heart contract to its limits, and his throat rapidly turned dry.</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant he did that, the big storm that was blowing hard around his area grew weaker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He unintentionally raised his eyebrows, and looked around his surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">The storm calmed down…　, To say that was a faulty expressive remark. Arubi Island is still, having strong winds blowing at it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only Shidou and Tohka's surrounding was, No‐It is more correct to say that only the surroundings of the two shadows that fell to the ground had a Calm Windless Condition like one in the eye of a hurricane.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku,kukukukuku…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, from his right, the girl that has her long hair braided up was, walking out with a fearless smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her age was no different from Shidou and the others. From her orange colored hair, to her mercury colored irises. Right now on the surface of her well-featured facial structure, was a shape distorted to a scornful smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the most characteristic part of her was the outfit she was wearing. Covered in a dark colored coat, and various parts of her body were tightened with something that looks like a belt. In addition to that, locks were placed onto her neck, right hand and right leg, coming out from the locks were torn off chains. She looked like a criminal that had committed an outrageous crime‐otherwise, it would be an outfit that looked like a curiosity-seeking masochist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks like you can put up a good fight, Yuzuru. Or should I say, one would expect from my other half. It should be expected from someone who has a battle record of 25 victories, 25 losses and 49 draws from me. But‐that will also end today"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether to say it's exaggerated, or a little too dramatic, she was a girl that uses strange words.</p>
<p class="null-p">And this time responding to those words, coming from his left side, the other shadow was progressing outwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. The one that controls the count for this 100th battle, does not belong to Kaguya but to Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">Coming from here, she was a girl that had her hair braided into 3. Although she had the same face as the girl called Kaguya but, her expression, was painted with a half opened eye that somehow makes her listless.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl here that was called Yuzuru was also, wearing the same weird designed outfit, she was putting on the same restraining clothes same as Kaguya.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the position of the locks were placed on her neck, left hand and left leg. They were placed on the opposite side compared to Kaguya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu, you babble a lot. How about giving up, and admit that I am the Spirit suitable to be the real Yamai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Denial. The one that will live on will be Yuzuru. Kaguya is not suitable to have the name Yamai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu…what a useless struggle. My future predicting magic eye has already seen what would happen a long time ago. In the next attack, I saw a vision of your body being pierced through by my Sturm Lanze!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pointing out. There are no examples of Kaguya's magic eye's hitting its prediction."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuzuru said that, Kaguya hesitated, and shouted as if she had forgotten the exaggerated state she was in just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shu, Shut up! My predictions came true before! Don't make fun of me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Demand. Yuzuru demands an exhibition of a specific example of her claims from Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…that is, about that. Look…I got the weather of the next day right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ridicule</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sneer. The results of a magic eye that is no different to a wrong side of a Geta"5B 1" (Laugh) Yuzuru can't suppress her snigger"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru placed her hands on her mouth, Fusu‐and leaked out a breath. It seems that she was laughing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Si, silence! I will sentence you to Death, for ridiculing my devil eye techniques! I will have your body be payment for making me angruee!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that that was quite insulting coming from Kaguya eyes. She made her stance while shouting. But, since she failed to end the sentence correctly, there was no coolness following her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Yuzuru did not bother and continued asking questions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Demand. Yuzuru demands another explanation regarding Sturm Lanze from Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu…there is no vessels bound by logic that exists, on my Sturm Lanze. It is tangible yet intangible. It is visible yet invisible. But it has the power and general concept that only specializes in when it comes to piercing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Summary. Which means it does not really have any special reason to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wr,wrong! There is a reason! Yuzuru is the idiot for not understanding it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Then provide an explanation that can make Yuzuru understand. It should be possible for the smart Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is…su, sudden. But don't be sad, for my black brain cells, has ascended to a higher level where you're understandings will never reach. Yes, it is like no lions would tell its intention to an ant‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. This means you are saying you can't do it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku, you…better not make me angry"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sneer. Sturm Lanze (Laugh)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do, don't laughhhhhhhhhhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya shouted with her face beet red, and immediately spread both her hands. The chains from her neck and right hand *Clank**clank* rang and the surrounding violent winds turned even stronger.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time Yuzuru too, took a stance as if she was responding to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, both of them mixed their sights together without lowering their guard. "Sink into the darkness! Haaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Charge. Eiyaaa‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with the loud shout of fighting spirit and the flat voice, both of them kicked the ground exactly on the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped. They are probably helpless if they were to be dragged into a clash of 2 spirits in such a close distance. Although Shidou might be able to heal his wounds from the Reiryoku he took from Kotori but, it is not difficult to imagine what would happen to Tohka that had lost her consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when he was in a hurry, the both of them were approaching closer to Shidou's eye range at a tremendous speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no time to casually think of anything. Shidou took a good and big breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPPPPP"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of Shidou's loud shouting, both of them halted on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, was that voice just now…eeerrrr, yes, it is somewhat similar to the grief of the dead echoing down from the bottom of the Cocytus…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Report. Kaguya, please look at that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru pointed at Shidou, and Kaguya distorted her eyebrows. It would seem that, they really did not realize Shidou and Tohka's existence until just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A human…you say? Impossible. For someone to be stepping foot into our battlefield, who are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Admiration. Yuzuru can't suppress her surprise"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that, and poured her suspicious sights towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, No…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou turned flustered and moved one step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless he did manage to stop the two of them from clashing but, as compensation, he had gained attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">He swallowed down his saliva while, getting glared at with 2 pairs of sharp eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he had no other choice, it was a careless action. That's because, he had purposely just called for the attention of (What's more, there is two of them) Spirits while he had no idea what their character and personality were like. If the case turns out that they are war-liking Spirits, then the situation had taken an incredibly bad turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at that moment a static-like noise shook his right eardrum and following that, he heard a sleepy voice coming from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Shin, can you hear me, Shin"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Reine-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, looks like it finally connected. Where are you right now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tha, that is"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou lowered his voice while, explaining the situation in simple terms. ‐he told her that, there are 2 Spirits, in front of him now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…what did you say? Inside the wind there are‐Don't tell me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I,is there something you know about…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, as if to interrupt Shidou and Reine's conversation, Kaguya that was giving him a sharp look opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To enter and interfere with our sacred duel, you, what intentions do you have? Based on your answer I will…errrr, use Schatten Lanze and pierce through you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pointing out. The name is different from just now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, whatever! Yuzuru you just keep quiet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Yuzuru does not understand why she has to keep quiet"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuzuru said it with a refreshing face, *Growl* Like a flesh-eating animal Kaguya…made that sound with her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou has a lot of things that was bothering him but, he repeated the improper word that was bothering him the most.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Du,duel…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He asked, and Kaguya eyes turned sharp.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is correct. How dare you just interrupt our scared duel that will determine our fate. What are you going to do to take responsibility for this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Restraint. Kaguya, it is a threat if you put it that way"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! And when I thought it would go well this time…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Confirmation. Did you say something"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No,nothing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya *Fuun* exhaled her breath, and looked away from Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, if this keeps up I can't settle my mind down. What am I going to do with this unhap‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, as if Kaguya thought of something good, she opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Aah I see, if it's like that then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then once again faced towards Yuzuru, and if she was slowly evaluating her, she crawled her sights from the top of Yuzuru's head to the tip of her toes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Is there something, Kaguya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…I thought of a good method, Oh Yuzuru. Both of us have done many types of battles. That is to the extent, where I could no longer think of any other events we can compete with"</p>
<p class="null-p">And it was as if she was performing in an opera show, Kaguya made exaggerated gestures while continuing talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But…don't you think we have one more match that we have not decided</p>
<p class="null-p">who the victor of it is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. What is the match that we have not determined who the victor is yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru tilted her head, and Kaguya *kukuku*leaked out a chuckle before looking at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"heh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wondering why‐Shidou felt a rather cold feeling, coming from that expression.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of moving, suddenly a violently strong wind blew, in an instant the scale of it increased, and it turned into a storm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it has come to that condition, they no longer had the leisure to walk around nonchalantly. Every student from the Raizen 2nd years, following the teacher's instructions, they were evacuated to the museum which was the nearest place from the airport. ‐but.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards the strong storm that was creaking the bulky glass window, Origami was clenching her fist while letting out her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside, the number of students that were evacuated inside of the building, Shidou's (and one ground beetle) figure was not in it. They must have gotten separated along the way, and unmistakably was left outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally she tried to rush outside to search for Shidou but, at the very last minute she was stopped by the teachers.</p>
<p class="null-p">No‐if by any chance she had gone outside, she could not even advance forward inside this storm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, the only thing Origami could do was to pray for Shidou's safety. The feeling of being powerless turned into the sense of impatience and was circling inside her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…oi, doesn't the sky somehow, look clear now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, a male student that was close to a window, unexpectedly let out those words. The bustling students then gathered towards the window, and started looking at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami raised her face as if she was flicked away from that voice, she weaves through the crowd of students and ran towards the museum entrance. "Ah…! To,Tobiichi-san! It's still dangerous!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami shook of Tamae's restraint, and opened the door. And just like that when she was about ‐to go outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami unexpectedly stopped her legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of the museum, the figure of the person Origami wanted to search for was already there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O, ou…Origami"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming to have realized Origami was there, Shidou opened his mouth. Probably because of the wind, his hair and clothes was in disordered but, luckily, there were no places injured.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Origami, instead of being relieved she frowned her eyebrows, and sharpened her sights.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's condition is weird…rather than that, it was more to Shidou having weird options following him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first thing was Tohka that Shidou was carrying on his back. It would seem that she had lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, this was okay. No, it isn't okay but, it was not the situation where Origami cannot predict the reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about it Shidou. Instead of that Yuzuru I am more charming right? If you were to choose me, I would not mind letting you make the kiss of contract on any parts on my body?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seducing. Please choose Yuzuru. I will do something good for you. It is a very amazing thing. Kaguya's is not even close to it"</p>
<p class="null-p">From his left and right, there were two girls with the same face in uniform standing there, for some reason they were over-familiarly touching Shidou's body, and were excessively trying to seduce him.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was feeling despair, his body was then bathed with stares from the other students; he then remembered the incident that happened around 10 minutes ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the area covered with a hurricane, the thing that Kaguya said out with a fearless smile was‐these contents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing that we have yet to determine who the victor. Namely that is… "Charm"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While suddenly making a cool pose, Kaguya declared that loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In Yamai the real Spirit and the child of hurricanes, does not only have power and intelligence but also has, loveliness and beauty enough to make the creator of the universe jealous, don't you think that is necessary?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pondering… "</p>
<p class="null-p">Few seconds of keeping silent, Yuzuru also, crawled her sights at Kaguya. From the top of her head to the tip of her toe, as if she was evaluating her, she slowly looked.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after doing that, Fumu, she nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. I see, is what I would answer. It is certain, that we have not compete with each other regarding this yet"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…am I right. But that is only normal. The number of people that has force their way into our conflict is non-existent‐that's because there wasn't supposed to be an appearance of a 3rd person that we have to entrust the decisions of the conflict to‐but, right now"</p>
<p class="null-p">While leaking out a low chuckle *Point*! ,Kaguya pointed her fingers towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, what's your name"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? I-Itsuka…Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou. Fumu. A frail name suitable for the sacrifice. Very well then. Right now you, will be left with the role of being the judge"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…? Eh, no…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could not grasp the meaning she said, his eyes turned to dots.</p>
<p class="null-p">But to Kaguya, she seems to not care about Shidou's will in this matter. She raised her chin as if to laugh it off and continued on with a provocative tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about it Yuzuru. This match, do you have the courage to accept it? Kuku, well, I can already see who the victor is, if I was to use my charms that are able to force the creator of the universe into submission. If you were to coil your tails now, you will not receive the vilifications of a coward"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Negative. That kind of thing is impossible. There is no reason Kaguya can win. Yuzuru was always the one more charming. All men would easily be beaten hands down"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku, only your high spirits are full-fledged"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Declaration. Yuzuru is the one cuter. Honestly speaking, Kaguya's worth is only the upper part of her lower half"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, WHAT THE HELL DID YOU SAY, YOU BASTAARRDDDDDDDDDDDD?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment Kaguya threw her winning state into the lapse of her memory, and shouted with a seriously threatening attitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally although Shidou has his own opinions but, Kaguya was quite beautiful. If she is worth only the upper part of her lower half, then it would probably means that the females of this world are compelled to enter a tough fight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't your face the same as mine! Why are our evaluations so different?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pity. Only facial features are not enough to determine a person's charm. Even if the materials are the same, the ambiance seeping out from us is too different. But do not worry. In the ugly world you are quite high-ranked"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What ugly world?! Isn't your attitude the ugly one for saying that with a calm manner?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reconsideration. I have forgotten that reality does not necessarily become the truth for the person in concern"</p>
<p class="null-p">"THAT ISN'T THE TRUUUUUUUTTTTHHHHHHH!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kaguya was about to scratch her head in mess, she remembered Shidou's existence. She immediately swung her shoulders and *Kohon* coughed. "An,anyways! If you were able to say that much then I have no objections!" Kaguya pointed her finger at Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"this is the last duel! The one, who wins this match, will absorb the opponent and become the real Yamai! The rule for the match is simple and clear! This man‐Shidou, the first one that makes him fall wins!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. ‐that match, I will gladly accept it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai, WAIT A MINUUUUTTEEEEE!"</p>
<p class="null-p">…and thus, coming to the present.</p>
<p class="null-p">He consulted Reine at that spot, since it was dangerous to flat out refuse their demands it turned into the reason where he had to bring them here but…the stares coming from his school friends hurts as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I,Itsuka-kun ? Who are those girls in the left and right? I have not seen them</p>
<p class="null-p">before…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Hitting on the local girls and cosplay? Itsuka were you walking around while holding onto girl uniforms?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought of a good part-time job Itsuka. Marching in the school while holding a signboard with "1 minute 1000 yen Punch all you want" written on it. We definitely will get enough people to build a house"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Noisy**noisy**noisy*. The students were making a commotion. That was probably normal. That's because, the supposedly lost Shidou, came with two unfamiliar girls with him while they were serving him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally by following Reine instructions, he made both of them release their AstralDress, and had them both wear Raizen high school's Summer uniform. Just like that time with Tohka, he had them create the clothes by gathering the information from sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he was in an emergency situation but, if he were to continue to let them wear the AstralDress that looked like a restraining outfit, there might be a chance that Shidou might be misunderstood as someone who holds a special fetish.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, Origami that was standing in front of everyone else from the class, after looking at Kaguya and Yuzuru, she quietly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, who are they?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errrrrr about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While averting his line of sight away Shidou let out his voice awkwardly. He was able to self-consciously admit that there were cold sweats floating closely on his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, at that moment as if to take control of the commotion, coming from behind a sleepy voice echoed across.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, I was waiting. It's the transfer students Yamai Kaguya and Yamai Yuzuru…right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there was the vice homeroom teacher of 2nd year group 4, Murasame Reine, she was standing there while wobbling her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Transfer student?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami asked a question, Reine "ahh" consented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…originally they were supposed to transfer in at the end of the holidays but…since they said they wanted to attend the school trip, it was planned for them to join up with us when we reached the area. I contacted them when we reached the airport just now, so I had him go pick them up"</p>
<p class="null-p">From hearing Reine words, standing beside her Tamae blankly stared into wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Tra,transfer student? Murasame-sensei, I didn't hear any of that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…since it was on short notice, they were probably too late to contact you about this case"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha, haaa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While making a bewildered face, Tamae withdrew. Well, if Reine, the vice homeroom teacher, was informed about the transfer student instead of the homeroom teacher herself, then such a face was not strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami looked at Reine with a doubtful eye, she returned her sights back towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, It's true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He replied back with a nervous voice. And, as if to match with that, Kaguya and Yuzuru that were sticking onto both of Shidou's side nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…it's exactly true. Human, think of it as a privilege to welcome the child of the hurricanes which is I"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Affirmative. There is no mistake of what he said"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just in case, as long as they are here, with the condition that Shidou would be the judge for their duel, he told them to match their speech together when it was needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was still in the state that she did not understand the situation but, since both the teacher and the people in concern were agreeing, she probably decided that it was no use to say anything. She made a small sigh and "I see" said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But once again, Origami sharpened her sights while opening her mouth. "…then, why are both of you sticking yourself onto Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, that is"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. That is"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lo, look! Since it was a strong wind, they did it so they would not get blown away!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to cover Kaguya and Yuzuru answer towards Origami's question, Shidou raised a loud voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">If they were to say something untactful here, the false information they gave with great trouble will lose its meaning. In order for the answer to successfully work, he continued to talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In,instead of that, Sensei, Tohka got hit on the head by a flying garbage bin and is now stretched out. Is there a place where I can let her sleep?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…ooh I see, that is a big problem. Come over here. The transfer student too, there are some important things I have to explain to both of you. Please follow us"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine said that like she was reading in monotone and as if to call Shidou and the others to her she beckoned them to come over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was gathering stares from the surroundings while, walking into the deeper part of the museum following Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Guided by Reine, Shidou that has entered the office located deeper in the museum, after laying Tohka down on the sofa he lowered his heads towards Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, having you help me like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no, don't worry about it. Instead‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that, Reine looked at Shidou‐to be accurate, she brought her eyes towards the two girls that were coiling themselves onto both his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">They separated themselves once when Shidou was dropping Tohka off, but they stuck themselves onto him once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in the state where they did not bother about the change of the environment they are in, they started whispering to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well Shidou. All you have to do is to choose me. Swearing your loyalty to this Yamai Kaguya, that body, and even that heart it will all be okay if you say that you will give me all of the above"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Negative. Nothing good will come if you choose Kaguya. By all means give Yuzuru a clear vote"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if they don't have Reine and Tohka in their eyes, both of them were blowing their breaths at Shidou's ears. And each time, cold sweat would flow down Shidou's face and he would twist his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…looks like it turned into a something troublesome"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">He said it with a heavy voice and nodded. Reine then scratched her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…rather this is beneficial to you right? A human like you, although it is only for a while but you are getting affection from me. Go ahead and cry at your good fortune, there is necessity to weep"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Skeptical. If it's Yuzuru I can still understand but, are there guys that would be happy if they are advanced from Kaguya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu, fun… it's useless no matter how many times you try to provoke me like this. All of it will be clear when you see the conclusion of the duel. Well Shidou, its okay to say it. Me or Yuzuru, which of one of us is charming as a woman?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Yuzuru or the spoiled Kaguya. Which one of us is cuter?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Wait, what is up with that weird sense of insult!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ignore. Instead of the cry-baby Kaguya, Yuzuru is much better"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you somehow making it worse!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While quarreling, Kaguya and Yuzuru were getting closer to Shidou. As if trying to calm both of them down Shidou *MaaMaa* swing his hands while saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai,wait for a second. The two of you have been saying 'duel, duel' for awhile now…why are both of you fighting in the first place anyway?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hmm? Aah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, Kaguya exaggeratedly raised her chin up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't I tell you? ‐both of us, were originally one Spirit called Yamai"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. However, coming to this worlds several times, made Yamai split into two"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Into two…so, how did something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He raised his eyebrows while looking at the both of them alternately. Other than the difference of hairstyle and facial expression, both of them had very similar features. They were so similar that, rather than calling them twins, calling them clones might also sound believable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh, why did something like that happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The only one that knows about this is the goddess of fate that sits in the heavens. Fuun, that ill-natured goddess probably tormented us because of her boredom and fatigue. Occasionally, there are times she uses unsystematic dices to make decisions and ignores following truth and reasons"</p>
<p class="null-p">"heh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Summary. I'm not exactly sure, is what Kaguya is saying"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are no feelings in that"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou nodded from hearing Yuzuru's explanation which finally led him to an understanding, Kaguya raised her voice in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">To return back to her normal state she *Kohon* coughed, and continue on with the explanation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And thus both of us that were separated into two came to seeing each other's face, and in our body, we came to a realization that our mission and fate was carved into our blood. Yes‐we came to understanding that there could only be one true Spirit the Yamai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explanation. We understood that Yuzuru and Kaguya that were separated into two, would eventually join back into one"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand, so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Supplement. "We knew it" is probably the better way to put it. Yuzuru and Kaguya, the instant our existence was split into two, we came to understand what will happen to our own body"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuzuru pointed her finger at her head, she continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explanation. However, the original Yamai has already lost her personality. Which means when the occasion comes, either one of us will become the main personality for Yamai"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, so that's why…the duel"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them nodded at the same time. Shidou let sweat ooze down his cheek while letting out his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In other words, that storm was caused by you two fighting…?" When he asked, Kaguya proudly folded her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be the case. ‐Our competition has been going on for a long time. Yes, in the current stage 99 battles have passed"</p>
<p class="null-p">"99 battles…Were you two fighting that many times!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Correction. Even if we said battles, it does not actually mean that we are doing fist fights all the time. Sprinting, Gendama, eating contest, etc, there were many-types of method for our matches"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were somehow, peaceful matches.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, if these two were to do a sprinting contest, serious damage might appear in the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, the battle results are 25 wins 25 lose and 49 draws. The winner for this 100th duel was supposed to become the real Yamai.‐although that was the case"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya gave a glare, and Shidou shorten his words. 'I see', Shidou seemed to have interrupted their important final duel.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he had no other choice even if he was told about something like that. If Shidou had not stopped the both of them at that time, he had no idea what would happen to Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou kept silent, Kaguya and Yuzuru entwine their arms onto Shidou's once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu…it's okay to no longer bother about that. I should be thankful to you instead. Because of you, we were able to do a battle that we have not done before"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Positive. It's true that Yuzuru thinks that our final battle to be a fist fight which always ends with a draw is a problem. Yuzuru has no objections if this is the match"</p>
<p class="null-p">They said that, and as if to seduce Shidou both of them continued entwining their arms with Shidou's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no, even if you tell me something like that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt his face getting hotter while, as if wanting help he sent his sights towards Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the requested Reine was sitting on a chair while operating a small terminal, she made a difficult *Fumu* and groaned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…as expected, it is no use"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what is no use?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, Reine made a small nod before turning her face to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, communications from 'Fraxinus' has been stopped"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Wh,why again…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…the current reason is unidentified. I will try investigating a bit" After saying that, Reine closed the terminal and stood up from the chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after giving a good glance at Kaguya and Yuzuru who were attached to Shidou, she quietly moved her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…you said you were, Kaguya and Yuzuru right? Both of you, in order to become the real Spirit Yamai, are now competing for Shidou as a match.</p>
<p class="null-p">…there is no mistake in that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Reine said that, Kaguya and Yuzuru turned their eyes towards Reine for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, that is exactly right. I don't mind if you're sightseeing but, if you try to be a hindrance then I will not hold back you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. You are?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…A school teacher"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Reine replied with a random lie, *Turn around* she turned to her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Shin, you take care of Tohka. ‐Kaguya, Yuzuru. There is a little talk I want to do with you two. Please follow me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, Reine-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's dangerous, he sent his sights towards Reine filled with that kind of intentions. Even as a joke, these two are Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Reine, no worries needed, as if to say that she raised her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"kuku…and when I thought what you were going to say. Why does someone like me, have to take orders from a mere human"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reject. Yuzuru wants to stay with Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, both of them stubbornly refused to move. However Reine shrugged her shoulders as if this was within her expectations, and talked as if to make them believe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…unlike his appearance, Shin is thick-headed. Hearing your conversations I think this has no disadvantages to you two"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…judging by his reactions it is clear right? From my eyes, you two are very charming and cute girls. But even so, he still does not choose any one of you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru, stared into wonder and looked at each other faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…what will you do now? From my standpoint, I don't mind whether if it is from one of you two"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that, and opened the office door.</p>
<p class="null-p">When both of them looked at each other once again, they reluctantly separated their hand from Shidou, and followed Reine.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: Double Approach</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">Time had passed, and it was now 18:50.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected even the sun had fallen, and the heat and humidity oppressing the day time had got a little better. And as if to match with that, the voice of the cicada echoing in the afternoon immediately switched to crickets.</p>
<p class="null-p">Later the group that moved to the hotel after waiting for Tohka to wake up, brought their luggage to their own respective rooms, and finished off their dinner before enjoying their free time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes‐everyone but Shidou that is.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa…why do things have to turn out like this again…" Shidou placed his hands on the hotel corridor wall while walking tiredly.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was only normal. That's because 2 unsealed Spirits had appeared and both entangled themselves with Shidou. And what's more, it was accompanied by the condition where not even a single person has evacuated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru, both of them became surprisingly obedient after receiving some kind of explanation from Reine in the museum but… that was not enough to erase his anxiety.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to somehow…do something about this."</p>
<p class="null-p">He made a sullen face while groaning, and continued dragging his legs forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now Shidou was heading towards Reine's room. He was going there to have a discussion about the objectives from now on, he was told to meet her in her room when he was about to exit the museum.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou stopped his legs when he was about to reach a T-junction.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Two heads were coming out of the corner of both sides of the road that was separated into two and they were firmly sending their gazes towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately, he noticed those living things. After Shidou nervously swallowed his saliva, he opened his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what are you doing, Kaguya, Yuzuru?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, both of them walked out from the deepest part of the road.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…not bad for noticing my presence. Or should I say it is to be expected from you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pointing out. It's only because the one hiding was bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! I,I don't want to be told that by Yuzuru! I was hiding better than you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. There is no reason that Kaguya can hide better than Yuzuru."</p>
<p class="null-p">…both of them were obvious from Shidou's perspective but, he refrained from saying it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the both of you, what were you two doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, both of them looked at each other for an instant before looking back at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu…let me tell you. You may follow me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guarantee. Please come this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">And at exact same time both of them pulled Shidou's arms respectively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what's going on, seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While looking left and right with a perplexed feeling, Shidou was being dragged‐before long, they reached a certain place.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were two blue and red flags hanging together next to each other at the entrance, and the words "Male" and "Female" were written on them respectively .</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the entrance to the hotel's famous outdoor bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…The baths?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou tilted his head, Kaguya exaggeratedly nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…the impure darkness has accumulated too much on your body. I permit you to purify that body"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Translation. Please go in the baths and wash away your sweat, was what she was saying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"aah…so that's what it means. But, the bath time is a little later right. I also</p>
<p class="null-p">haven't prepared any change of clothes or towels yet. And what's more, there is a place I have to go right now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said that and about to turn behind, both of his arms were grabbed even tighter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch ouch…wha, what was that for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you think someone like you has the right to choose? Stop grumbling about trivial matters and purify those impurities"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Please go ahead. The preparations for bathing are all assembled here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru lowered her sights downward. And there were bath towels, towel and a yukata folded there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh, why do you have to go that far…what on earth are you two planning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu…there is no way my noble and mysterious thoughts, could be understood and grasped by an ordinary person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Proposal. Something like a big bath-house with no people in it is a nice thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou alternated between looking at the two of them with doubtful eyes, *Haaa* he made a big sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not like Reine had set a strict specific time, there was a chance that the both of them would start acting violently if he were to refuse their instructions now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I understand. Then I will let myself go on in first.", "Kuku…as long as you understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Praise. Yuzuru respects Shidou's decision."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he had not a single clue about what these two's intentions were but, well it was true that he wanted to go to the baths and have his fatigue and sweat washed away. He grabbed the towels and such that were prepared, and entered the male baths.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment when he took a glance behind, for some reason, Kaguya's cheek was red as if she was a little shy and Yuzuru was placing her hands towards her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">While feeling suspicious towards their behavior, Shidou took off his clothes in the undressing room; he then carried a towel in one hand and pulled open the sliding door that had been fogged up by steam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oooh…this is amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, he unintentionally leaked out admiration towards the scenery that was expanding in front of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the gigantic bathtub formed by stones, it was filled with slightly brown hot water and thick steam was floating out of it. Furthermore, the sea was just a little further ahead, the bathtub and the soft sound of ripples echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to it still not being bath time, there were no people other than Shidou. I see, this might the best location according to what Yuzuru said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickly washed his head and body, placed the towel on his head and sunk his body into the hot water.</p>
<p class="null-p">"aah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, he leaked out such a voice that stinks of the elderly. When he extended both his legs and hands, he spread his whole body into the slightly hot water.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, it was at that time. The sound *Roll* appeared and the sliding door for the bath house opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">He brought his eyes towards the entrance wondering if someone entered‐Shidou stiffened up in the water.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was probably a normal reaction. That's because, Kaguya and Yuzuru whom he had separated from just now in the corridor, were now standing there with one bath towel wrapped around their body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, you girls what the hell are you doingggggggggg! This is the male baths you know!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to hold back Shidou shouted, just like that both of them dipped their feet into the bathtub and walked beside Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the steam the thin bath towel stuck onto their skin, and both of their body silhouettes distinctively came outwards. When Shidou face turned red unintentionally, he sunk his face even deeper into the water.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Shidou's reaction, Kaguya folded her arms while blushing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku,kukuku…ho, how about it. As expected even you have no choice but to grovel upon my charm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those words, Yuzuru stood in a manner as if confronting Kaguya *Fusu*‐, leaked out a breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sneer. Charm (laugh). That's the first time Yuzuru heard Kaguya possessed something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…fuun, I will immediately make that face of yours cry. By making that Shidou over there fall for my charm!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Challenge accepted. Yuzuru will take it on."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, both of them slowly bent their legs, and enter the bathtub as if to squeeze Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Originally wearing a bath towel while entering the baths was a violation of manners but, there was no way he could point something like that out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's stiffened up his body nervously, and instinctively closed his eyes. "Kuku…it's okay to resolute yourself Shidou. Allow me to make that body of yours unable to be satisfied unless it's me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. Yuzuru will have Shidou become the victim of my body."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what are you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing both of them Shidou's body stiffened up even harder. Aah, I wonder what kind of amazing things they will do to me. Being captured by the little anticipation from an unknown fear, his mind was spinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing happened, even after a while passed. Shidou slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The both of them were positioning themselves on Shidou's left and right side, and were only mixing their sights as if they were provoking one another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"fu…, Oh kind Yuzuru, I allow you to go first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. It's unnecessary. Rather Kaguya is the one that needs a handicap. I will at least give you the right to start first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaka, you're someone that doesn't get it. Shidou eyes will be nailed onto me the moment I lay my hands on him. How about trying to understand my concerns to allow you to make a moment for yourself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doubt. In reality you have no idea what would be a good thing to do right?" When Yuzuru said that, *Twitch* Kaguya's shoulder twitched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th, there's no way that's true! I'm very ero ero! Wha, what are you saying! I have many adult techniques that someone like you could never think of!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Suspicious. Well, then please show it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…ah, fu, fuun! Alright, watch carefully!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kaguya stood up from her spot, while looking at Shidou's direction, she placed her right hand on her head and placed her left hand on her hip and,… "…u,ufuu~n"</p>
<p class="null-p">She took such a pose that even out-dated gravure models would not.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Yuzuru placed her hands on her mouth and, * Puuukusukusu* leaked out a breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"errrrr…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his cheeks not knowing what is a good thing he should be saying… no, it was not like it wasn't sexy. The wet bath towel sticking onto Kaguya's skin was certainly sexy.</p>
<p class="null-p">However… compared to before, an unbearable feeling was filling Shidou's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at these two reactions, Kaguya's face dyed red and once again dived into the bathtub.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th, the two of you together, What's wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sneer. As expected from Kaguya's charm (Laugh) it's different."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what did you say!? kuh, I mean isn't that it? And what about you, in reality aren't you the one that has no idea what to do!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya pointed her fingers while saying that. When she did that, Yuzuru *twitched* made the edge of her eyebrows move.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Objection. There is no way such a thing is true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa, I wonder! Then how about doing it now and showing me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Acknowledged… as you wish."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Yuzuru said that she turned around and faced Shidou,…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bewitch. Chuuu."</p>
<p class="null-p">And, she blew a flying kiss with the posture of an olden time idol.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…ah, un"</p>
<p class="null-p">And again, while wondering how to give a proper reaction, Shidou let sweat ooze out of his forehead while making a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that pose, Kaguya held her stomach under her arms and laughed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyahahahahahahaha! What is that, whaaat is that! Were you seriously planning to bewitch him with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Disappointed. I do not want to be told that by Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haan, that goes for you too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. With Kaguya's child-like figure, something like seduction is not possible in the first place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! Yo, yours isn't that much of a difference from mine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. Even if it close by a narrow margin from using arithmetic's, the massaging feeling is different."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku, kuku…looks like you don't understand the charm of a slender body."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sneer. Slender (laugh). Reality won't change no matter how much you sugarcoat it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"fu, fuun…! An object like that is nothing but a mass of fat after all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Resentment. Yuzuru cannot pretend to not hear that. I treat that as Kaguya's jealousy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't treat that like jealousy! I'm not envious or anything! It's obvious that Shidou thinks I'm the much cuter one compared to the fatty Yuzuru!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. It is a fatal handicap for a woman to have no breasts when they are trying to appeal to a male. A chicken bone like Kaguya would not be accompanied."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh, WHO THE HELL IS A CHICKEN BONE!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Challenge accepted. Who is a fatty?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, despite having more split ends than me! Hoo-ra~ Shidou, you don't like a woman like that right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pointing out. Kaguya is the one that smells more like sweat compared to Yuzuru. You fall behind in charm as a woman."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh ,What the hell!? Even you have higher fat percentage than me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pity. In the end Yuzuru now knows pity towards Kaguya who only knows how to point that out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! Look! Puyo Puyoo! Puyo Puyoo!"5C 1"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Return fire. Peta Petaa! Peta Petaa!"5C 2"</p>
<p class="null-p">The both of them started quarreling. And‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou twitched his shoulders. The sliding door made a sound once again; it was probably someone else coming it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O,oi…somebody entered. Shouldn't you two hide?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the male baths. And naturally, the new intruder would obviously be a male student.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Kaguya and Yuzuru said it in a calm and relaxed manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…what are you saying, Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. There is no problem. There is no need to worry"</p>
<p class="null-p">"huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not understanding what these two meant, Shidou tilted his head. And,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Toryaa‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a very energetic voice, the new bathing guest energetically jumped into the bathtub.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then Shidou, who had entered the baths earlier saw that person.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a dignified voice tone which he has memories of. Night colored long hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Painted by a beautiful curvy body line, that could not possibly be thought to belong to a male. Yes, that figure was‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Belonged to none other than Yatogami Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment, Tohka also seem to have noticed the previous guest. She then looked at Shidou blankly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of their faces met, and at an exact timing both of them raised a scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka moved her hands hastily in panic, and immediately covered her chest and lower parts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh,whwhwhwhwhwhwhwhwhwh what are you doing here Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,nononono why did you enter here! This is the male baths!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying! I followed exactly what everyone taught me, and entered the red one!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that instant Shidou body suddenly twitched. A cold chill passed through his spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, you girls…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said that and brought his eyes to his left and right side, Kaguya and Yuzuru replied back blankly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, I switched the entrance flag just before Shidou entered. As expected from me. I'm such a tactician."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Is there by any chance, a problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y.o.u giiiirrllllllllsss…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's voice was filled with resentment and he glared at the both of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was almost close to bearing a grudge but now was not the time for that. He turned around to face Tohka and lowered his head with vigor as if he was dipping his face into the bathtub.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka, believe me. I swear I didn't plan to do something like this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O,oo…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While Shidou was desperately trying to appealing to her, Tohka made a confused face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th,then what are you doing here in a place like this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got tricked! Sorry, I'll immediately get out now…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was about to get out of the bathtub while trying his best not to look at Tohka's body, Tohka unexpectedly grabbed his hands. It was like; she was trying to restrain Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what's wrong Tohka"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…that way, is a bad idea I think."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Shidou's eyes turned to dots, the sliding door again opened, and the group of girls entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">He quickly sank back into the bathtub in panic, and hid behind the shade of the rocks.</p>
<p class="null-p">If this was pondered carefully, this was a normal occurrence. It became bath time and Tohka had entered the bath which means, the other girls would all come in to the bath at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yaa‐, isn't this wideee~! The sea is just right theree~~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, transfer student-san, both of you already entered. So fast~~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are, Tobiichi-san aren't you going into the baths?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"there is, something I have to do no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, I see…good luck."</p>
<p class="null-p">He heard the high-pitch voices of the girls. It was probably only a matter of time before he would be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thi,thithithithi this is bad…! wha,what am I going to do …!"</p>
<p class="null-p">From a pinch that he never experience before, Shidou held his head between his hands and made his eyes swim around.</p>
<p class="null-p">If by any chance he were to be found hiding there, he would most probably be ganged up and beaten.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, if that happens it would still be okay. Being pasted with the label of a sex offender that will never disappear in a lifetime, there is no mistake that he has to live his remaining school life, being told it was a mistake of his youth or labeled as a pervert or even being called the incarnation of sexual desire. Rather than that, in a worst case scenario there might be a chance this event would involve the police‐</p>
<p class="null-p">And, while Shidou was trembling, Tohka was moving around as if she was hiding Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To,Tohka…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like its Shidou's fault right…? Then, hurry up and run away using my shadow to hide."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! So,sorry. I owe you one…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Luckily, thanks to the steam of the reddish brown water, it became harder to look at Shidou's figure. With Tohka acting as a wall, there might be a chance to escape outside of the girl's baths.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay… let's go then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O, ou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He nodded at Tohka's voice. When he did that, while being submerged in the bathtub, Tohka began walking like a crab.</p>
<p class="null-p">While hiding behind her back, he continued advancing beneath the water. ‐However,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Tohka-chan spotted~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Why are you at the edge?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly uwaah, your skin is so pretty. You bastard let me massage it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of Tohka, the Ai Mai Mii trio appeared. Inside Shidou's head, the BGM of encountering an enemy in a RPG rang and echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no, nothing is wrong! Don't worry about it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as Tohka said that, the Ai Mai Mii trio was totally interested in her. If this keeps up, they might notice Shidou's figure hiding behind Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaa…! What is a giant wheat bread doing at a place like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka suddenly shouted, and pointed somewhere far. At that moment, the 3 of them turned their attentions towards there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chance. When Shidou turned his body around, he dived into the sea from the edge of the rocks.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, a few gentlemen were gathered in the corners of the male baths in a circle. They were exchanging conversation with soft voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oi Tonomachi, it better be true right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked a question from a classmate, Tonomachi's *Grin* corner of his lips went up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, there is no mistake. Although it is usually unnoticeable when someone enters the bathhouse but, a part of the fence acting as a wall between the female and male baths, has a doubtful gap opened in it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooo…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The comrades of battle that had the same motives raised their voice at the same time. *Un**Un* after Tonomachi nodded, he suddenly held out his hand in the middle of everyone. And naturally, everyone else's hands piled up on his.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you all finished your preparations and resolution?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood! Then follow me! I will show you this world's paradise…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"OOOOHH!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rough voices echoed around, and everyone raised their hands high.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tonomachi cast his eyes downwards as if to taste the lingering thin intoxicating feeling, he then slowly walked. And thus he advanced towards the bath house fence making as little sound as possible, until he reached the target point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, now then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tonomachi looked at his comrades of war, everyone gave him a nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You go first, Tonomachi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You gave all of us courage. You guided all of us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Burn the view properly, into your eyes and soul."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You guys…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tonomachi energetically wiped away his tears using his arms, he replied back by giving a big nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, let's go…look closely at, my way of life!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tonomachi said that and stretch his back to make himself taller; he then peeked inside the part of the fence which has a small gap opened on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He met an eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking over carefully to this side from the female side and belonging to Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…So,sorry to have bothered you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tonomachi said it with a dry voice and returned his foot to its original place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine was operating the small terminal in her room, unexpectedly wrung her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">Coming from outside the door, *step**step* she heard the sound of footsteps.</p>
<p class="null-p">And following with the thought of the sound stopping in front of the room, *knock**knock* someone knocked on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Go on ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Reine said that, the door slowly opened, Shidou,wearing a single towel wrapped around his hips entered the room. For some reason his whole body was dripping wet, *clatter**clatter* and was trembling with his hands holding his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at that state, Reine was immersed in thoughts for a few seconds before‐*Pon* hitting her hand as if she got it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…isn't it a little too early, for you to be doing a night visit?"</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…you inferior humans. Think of it as a privilege to live in the same room as me. It's alright to carve my name highly into your heart. The name of the child of hurricanes, Yamai Kaguya."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl that had turned up in room number 40 which is the room Tohka and the others was staying in, was sitting on top of the table and were arrogantly making a greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was extremely rude but, probably because of Kaguya's high-pitched voice and proud face, her unpleasantness was not that oppressive. She was giving out a pleasant feeling like a little kid acting as their favorite character.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, let's be friends. Nice to meet you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Yup**yup* Tohka nodded while folding her arms. And as if to match up with that, the group members Ai, Mai, and Mii who were sitting beside her, all smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a hurry, when Reine said let this girl stay with all of you for one night, the three of them were shocked but, basically since all of the members here like cute and fun things, they immediately agreed to it. "Kyaaaa!" They made smiling faces as if make it lively and started to poke Kaguya's cheeks or even patted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Iyaaa Moouu, Kaaawaaaaiiiiii. Sooo cutee!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her hair's so silky. Her cheeks are so squishy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you like sweet things? Do you want to eat some Pokey?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"St,stop, You bastards! You all are disrespectful! *munch**munch*…" Kaguya unbearably raised a shout. And by the way she was eating Pokey.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Mii, I also want some Pokey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hai~ Hai~, it's alright Tohka-chan… , ah , so sorry. The one I gave</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya-chan just now was the last one. Do you want to eat YanYanTsukebou"5C</p>
<p class="null-p">3"instead?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…what is that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka was making a serious face and was taking a good look at the cylindrical object handed to her, Ai Mai Mii threw another question at Kaguya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ne‐Ne‐, so, where did Kaguya-chan come from?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's kind of rare to be transferring schools at a time like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Group 4 okay if you enter the new school term?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ai Mai Mii threw question after question in rapid succession. *Swish*and Kaguya crossed her legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where…huh. Fuu, that's a good question. The place I came from is from the summit of the heavens and also the bottom of the ground. It is in the farthest part of the afterlife and just beside the edge of the present world. It is not in the realm of the likes of you people to be able to understand with that category of thoughts.", "After-life…present world…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka tilted her head. However, she could understand that something amazing was being said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu. I see, Kaguya is amazing to know so many hard words!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…looks like you understands. I took a liking to you. What is your name called?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, its Yatogami Tohka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka huh…kuku, it's a nice name. Here, let me pat you."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason Kaguya's mood lighten up, and *rub**rub* patted Tohka's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu? What, what is it, its ticklish."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to be promising. By the darkness of baptism, I will add you into my kinsman."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kinsman? What is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…that is the allowable qualifications to be in the line of battle as I am the general. It means that you are able to put your name into the list of the world's greatest clan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"OOu…! Although I don't really get it but, are you willing to do something that amazing for me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, when Tohka said that honestly, Kaguya's finger trembled as if she was overcome by emotion. Somehow, it was as if it was the first time she met someone who understood her. Much like an inventor or an artist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ou, of course! I will use my whole body and soul to protect you! Think of it as an honor!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, I feel honored!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at these two, Ai Mai Mii placed their hands on their cheeks and "Yaan~!" raised their voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah I seriously can't take it anymore. Tohka-chan and Kaguya-chan are too cute."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, can I take one photo? Eye's over here please~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It makes you think that gender is only a trivial thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, for some reason they would twist their body, make poses with a digital camera and even lick their lips while gazing towards them with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya frowned her eyebrows towards those gazes before her eyes stared into wonder as if she realized something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said you are called Tohka right. Don't tell me you…are that girl that was bearing Shidou's back at that time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"? Did something happen to Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka answered that, Kaguya squinted her eyes, pulled Tohka's hand and walked to the corner of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Arere~, Kaguya-chan where are you going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right now, I am attempting to share very important information with my kinsman.</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to the words having a curse that no normal human can bear, if heard by a normal person's ear that ear will become sore and fall off. But if that is still okay with you, you are allowed to listen"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, A secret talk. Ahaha, we wouldn't do anything like eavesdropping."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aii said that while making a cheerful smile. However, Tohka did not bother with that. While pushing her earlobes with both her hands, her body was trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"e,ears will drop off…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do not worry. It's is not a problem for me and my kinsman such as you, since we hold mysterious powers inside us"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…a kinsman is something amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka mumbled while making a quiet expression, Kaguya nodded satisfied and asked her with the volume of her voice lowered. "Tohka, you, look like you are close to Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu? Umu, I know a lot if it is regarding Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"!, I see. Kuku…if that is the case, there are some questions that I want to ask you."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka said that, Kaguya stood her fingers straight and let out her questions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. I will be under your care for tonight, I am Yamai Yuzuru. Please to meet all of you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, the girl with the listless half-eye pressed three of her fingers in each hand on the floor and lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no, it's okay even if you don't have to be that formal…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reacting to Yuzuru's unnecessary politeness, it seemed like everyone in room 42 was being polite back to her instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moving her hands in a panicked and un-calm manner, she made an awkward dry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Originally this group, having the center as the class's most quiet group members, was composed of the remaining students that had failed to find a group. Since the group members themselves did not have much conversation from the start, the conversation did not advance any further than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami was not bothered by the awkward atmosphere at all. But rather she was quiet as always, due to her usual habit of not making unnecessary conversation , she seemed to have taken a liking to this group.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting at the corner of the room, she was making regretful sighs while looking outside the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">The result of careful research beforehand, she had discovered a gap in a part of the fence acting as a wall between the female and male baths but…she was unable to find Shidou's figure anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, she heard a member; probably unable to bear the silence, call out towards Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"e,errrr…doesn't your leg hurt? If it's okay with you, we have a zabuton"5C 4"</p>
<p class="null-p">…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Grateful. I will take you for your word."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said it shortly, and Yuzuru walked towards the group members.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, the group finally exhaled in ease. The atmosphere of the room, turn softer just by a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am sure you have a lot of problems because of the sudden transfer, just ask if you have something you aren't sure about okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Many thanks. I am greatly obliged to your considerations."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru said that, and again lowered her head. The female student wearing glasses, made a troubled dry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, Yuzuru opened her lips at the same time as she was raising her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Then there is one, question I want to ask but, is it okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, of course. What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. I wish for you to teach me the ways of attracting the affections of a male."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the question let out by the expressionless Yuzuru , the group members stiffened up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E,eerrrr…? What did you say just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Repetition. The ways of attracting the affections of a male. I hope that you will instruct me in the art of coaxing that leads him unable to endure anymore, and release the shackles of reasoning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The group member's faces were dyed red. This was the gathering of a group of nothing but girls that are comparatively plain even in class. They might not have the immunity to this kind of topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, maybe unable to back away after saying she could ask anything, the first girl that called out to Yuzuru opened her mouth nervously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see …something like, coincidentally pretending to touch each other's</p>
<p class="null-p">hand…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no, that kind of Shoujo manga is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh…then what am I suppose to say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errr, let's see…something like, handing over juice that has been partially drank beforehand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naïve"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that conversation, Origami interjected from the side. The group members looked with a surprised face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? To,tobiichi-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you meant by naïve …?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is not even worth talking about. You won't be able to make the target person to fall for you if you use those aimless actions"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami said that, she found that Yuzuru's eyes were quietly shining.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Yuzuru can see that you are no ordinary person. Please instruct me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami sighed, she changed her body's orientation towards Yuzuru, and used her fingers to point in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru immediately stood up, and sat on the place Origami pointed to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First, the most important thing is‐" And then Origami started talking softly.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow managing to come out from the sea and reaching Reine's room, Shidou who was borrowing a spare Yukata, drank up the tea poured into the teacup before sighing loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, for the help…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no. it looks like it was a disaster." After saying that, Reine shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou unintentionally averted his eyes. Reine was wearing the provided Yukata but…probably because the part where the Obi tied was done carelessly, every time she moved, he peeked towards her seductive chest. In the eyes of a healthy male student, it was a somewhat strong poison.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…? Is anything wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no. Rather than that, is communication with the 'Fraxinus' restored?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no, it's no use."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I…see. Errr, then about those two‐Kaguya and Yuzuru…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine made a small nod, and started operating the small note personal computer placed on top of the table. On the screen, taken from a distance, the figure of 2 human shadows dancing in the wind, detailed numbers and sequenced words was being shown on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the physiognomy of the person could not be differentiated with just the picture but‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is…Kaguya and Yuzuru?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, most probably."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou pointed at the screen and raised his voice, Reine brought her head forward a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…in reality, these girls are quite famous between us. Right when I heard you say you saw a two-person Spirit in the wind; I could somehow guess who it was"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by…famous?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked the question, Reine lightly pulled her hands out, as if to talk in steps.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…those girls are called 'Berserk'. Just like what you saw, they are a Spirit accompanied with the wind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Berserk'…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah. They are the two-person spirit confirmed in all around the world of this realm. Appearing into this world, both of them were only always joking around but…the problem was the scale of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"aah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his cheeks while remembering what happened in the afternoon. It was a strong storm that was able to knock down many trees and make the sea rage.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would probably be unbearable if that occurred many more times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is probably those girls' fault for the number of outbreak-natured storms occurring around the world. On top of that, the amount of eye-witness information is unusually high. Having their photos taken in a American gossip magazine, it seems there is a little controversy whether it is an angel, UFO or even the flying spaghetti."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eye-witnesses…, ah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment Shidou realized. Speaking of which, even though there was a Spirit appearing nearby, the Space Quake alarm nearby did not ring.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the northern part of the Arubi Island, it was a place with a high diffusing rate shelter that does not lose to Tenguu city that Shidou and the others are living in. If they were to confirm the omen of a Space Quake, there is no mistake that the alarm will ring.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, those two came to this world silently?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that in fear, Reine swung her head sideways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no, it looks like the omen was confirmed. ‐but, it happened far above in the skies of the Pacific Ocean." Shidou unintentionally stared into wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Pacific Ocean's‐sky?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah. Both of the 'Berserk's Space Quake scale is A rank…it is an explosion incomparable to Tohka and the others. But for some reason most of it, was confirmed in the middle of the sky with nothing in it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, then, why did those two come to this island…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it's simple. They moved here, after appearing into this world from the sky. While both of them were locked in a grapple that was like a transporting cyclone, they moved a distance of a few hundred kilometers, in just a few minutes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it is a hurricane that has the intentions of causing trouble for the world. Although it shows precise intentions of attacking humans, it is not because they hate this world; it is because the after-math of the two of them just quarreling will leave, the forests, mountains, rivers and towns in devastation, they are whimsical berserkers."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Reine was saying that, she then hit the terminals enter key. When she did that, the image of a town wrecked into pieces appeared onto the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…the damage done by those girls is very serious. Adding on, having their figures being exposed to the public's attention, it is an annoyance to the organizations that wants to conceal the existence of Spirits. Due to that, Kaguya and Yuzuru are appointed as priority targets, to 'Ratatoskr' and to the AST…</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there were not many people that were able to get close to them so far."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh,why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it's because of their movement speed and movement radius. There is no one that is able to chase them after they come over to this world. However it could be said that this is luck within luck, that you were able to encounter those two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine continued on after swaying her head a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it's true right now, we are in the situation where communications to 'Fraxinus' are cut off and we can't get support from 'Ratatoskr'. I cannot conduct a proper analysis, with only the equipment I have now. If we were to conduct the capture now, it would probably be much more risky than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐it's not all bad"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And by that you mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aren't those girls, the ones trying to gain your affection right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let sweat droop down his cheeks. Because of that, he experienced a hard time just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…towards the extremely low encounter rate 'Berserk', this is a situation that cannot be wished for. If we were to let this chance get away, not joking, we might not be able to meet Kaguya and Yuzuru a second time again. That's why, I would like the seal to be performed before those girls change their minds."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, to capture them without the assistance of 'Fraxinus'…is what you want to say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Shidou swallowed his own saliva as if he was nervous because of his own words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the choices were 50% helpful but…it is painful to be unable to know the targets' mental state. And most of all, having a backup support behind him, and to be able to have the recognition that he is not alone, makes his psychological state unimaginably calm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I guess you're right. In truth there is one more thing that will be posing a problem to capturing those girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something that will pose a problem…is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it's simple. 'Berserk' has two people in it. What's more, they are now competing with each other on who will be able to seduce you. If by any chance you were to kiss any one of them‐what do you think would happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he does the kiss for the sealing, those girls would probably take the kissed person as the winner of the match.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the winner will lose their Reiryoku the moment she becomes victorious.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if the loser does not agree with the conclusion of the match and starts rampaging‐there won't be anyone capable on stopping her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…although I am not doubting their pride and morals but…I</p>
<p class="null-p">can't take it as a basis for exposing the residents of Arubi island and the students to danger."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess…you're right. Then, then, does it means that I have no other choice but kiss with one of them while hiding from the other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine made a difficult groan, towards Shidou's proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I can't say it is for certain. It looks like those two were originally one Spirit. Just like you, Tohka and the others, there might be a chance that there is a Reiryoku Pass between those two. If that is the case, the other side will probably notice the moment the other one is sealed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, then, what on earth should I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou made a difficult face and asked, Reine lowered her head forwards while folding her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it is not like there is no way to do it. There is one, plan I have already worked on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Plan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah. This afternoon, during the time we talked, I exchanged an agreement with them. On the last day of the school field trip‐which is until the morning of the day after tomorrow, they must make you choose which of them is more charming."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The day after tomorrow…right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah. If they are able to get the results without fail in two days, those girls will probably not pay back the grudges that easily right? At the very least, we are able to gain an extension of one day. To us, this is a very precious‐Date time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Reine's words, Shidou's gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which means…one day tomorrow, you're saying…that I have to make Kaguya and Yuzuru fall for me? But‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no, it's a little different."</p>
<p class="null-p">And, in the middle of Shidou's words, Reine swung her head sideways.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This time, I, will be the one making you fall for me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…that's why you will go above that and will make them fall for you"</p>
<p class="null-p">For an instant he did not understood what Reine said, Shidou opened his eyes and mouth wide. Although he could not understand it by himself but, he was probably making the suitable idiotic face.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Reine did not laugh at Shidou's funny state, but instead continued on with a soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I will hand incam's to Kaguya and Yuzuru and Shin I will help them proceed in giving them a helping hand in capturing you. All you have to do is show favorable responses, and act accordingly to the girls I am giving orders to. ‐She is someone I can trust to support me, and thus, just like that, I want her to think that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, no, wait, I don't get what you are saying…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…if both of them were to get the conclusion that the advice I gave them was accurate‐there is a chance that I can control both of their actions to a certain extent. Yes, for example‐I can make both of them kiss you at the same time, like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou immediately twitched his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiss both of them at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally he had never even tried it before but‐if it were to seal both of their Reiryoku at the same time then, it was probably possible to reduce Reine's worries.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it's no different from a desperate plan. However…if that's able to seal the two of them then, I think this is the only plan we have. So how about it?" Reine said it while giving Shidou a fixed stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How… …you say."</p>
<p class="null-p">While staring back at the eyes decorated on the bear, Shidou dampened his throat with his saliva.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is true that this is an extremely difficult mission. Just one mistake and not only Shidou but, Tohka, Origami, everyone from school and the residence of this island will be dragged into it.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐if Shidou does not do this, there might be another outbreak natured hurricane appearing somewhere in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more. Shidou bit his lips a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing the nature of Kaguya and Yuzuru's relationship, Shidou felt an unbearably disgusting feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">They are quarreling for the sake of sitting on the seat of being the main personality‐the one that loses, will be absorbed by the other and disappear.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the sake of surviving, they have no other choice but to kill their opponent, the worst plot.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment they were born, both of them were burdened with an extremely unreasonable fate of knowing one of them will vanish.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if Shidou succeeds in sealing both of their Reiryoku, there might be a chance that he would be able to change that fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside Shidou's mind, the memories of the Spirits he came in contact until now resurfaced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka. Yoshino. Kurumi. And also‐Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether it was dangerous or whatever, or things like what will happen to the world, he did not mind things like that being his second and third priorities.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirits. He wanted to save those girls trapped and given the worst destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">That reason was more than enough for Shidou to extend his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand…I'll try."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry. That will be helpful."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said that, Reine suddenly removed her sights from Shidou and lightly lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">He will be troubled if she is that formal. Shidou made a dry smile while waving his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way. Even I want to save the Spirits‐" And. When he was about to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Achhkkchooo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a flashy sneeze and shook his shoulders. Speaking of which, he felt that it was a little chilly even though it was summer time. It would seem he got cursed from diving into the sea just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…is it a cold?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…I don't think it's a problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">He said that and slurped his dripping nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at that moment Reine, *Pon* hit her hands as if she thought of something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reine-san? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, as expected it is not good if you don't take care of yourself. Just rest for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? No, as expected that is a little…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…tomorrow, if by any chance you were to go down then, what are you going to do with Kaguya and Yuzuru?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told that, *Muu* Shidou groaned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. Then, I will let myself rest for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason Reine grabbed Shidou's hand, when he said that and was about to stand up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…please wait, Shin.‐You are going to sleep here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not understanding what Reine's words mean, Shidou stared in wonder.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">Approximately 20 minutes had passed after that. Shidou completely understood what Reine's intentions were.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…Oh Shidou I have heard from Reine. It looks like you have gotten a cold. Kaka, a human is such a fragile thing. For their bodies to fall ill after that small degree."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Declaration. Please be at ease. If you are to take Yuzuru's nursing, then you will be at full health by tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, the figures of Kaguya and Yuzuru wearing yukatas entered the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, sorry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said that and made a dry smile while inside a futon, having a wet towel placed on top of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant he wanted to leak out "who's fault did you think it was, who" words like this but, he locked it in the deepest part of his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">He heard the general idea from Reine. The point is to increase their intimacy points by having them nurse him and at the same time, understand both of their movement patterns.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the purpose of avoiding infecting the other students, the teaching staff vacated the room and Shidou slept there alone. Incidentally a hidden camera was installed in the shadows of the objects and was recording every single detail of these two's movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru, will somehow try to gain some points here, and were probably enthusiastic about making Shidou choose. They were in an unusually motivated state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…then I will be bothering you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Discourtesy. Yuzuru will allow herself to enter."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them took off their slippers, and after they entered the room, they sat on the left and right side of Shidou as if to interpose him.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, they looked down at Shidou's face fixedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…err, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Kaguya and Yuzuru immediately raised their face and mixed their sights.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…oh Yuzuru. I am going to say this first. You are going to hurt yourself if you think I am the same Yamai Kaguya from before. I have an excellent kinsman; thanks to her I have been reborn as the new me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sigh. Kaguya's bluffing started again."</p>
<p class="null-p">At Kaguya words, Kaguya shrugged her shoulders like she gave up. It was a straightforward provocation. But Kaguya did not fall for it and distorted her mouth while leaking a fearless smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru also sensed Kaguya's composure too. She squinted her eyes slightly .</p>
<p class="null-p">"Admiration. It looks like that is not an unnecessary lie at all.‐However, that goes for Yuzuru too. Yuzuru has gained a wonderful teacher. You are no longer Yuzuru's enemy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hou…? Interesting. Then let's have a fair fight!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that and Kaguya once again lowered her gaze back at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu"</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing taking a bath and changing in to her sleep-wear, Tohka walked along the hotel corridor, and encountered Origami when she was just about to reach the crossroad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing simply designed sleep-wear, a small pouch-like object hung from her wrist and for some reason she was holding a plate with wrap on it. It would seem that Onigiris were placed on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Tohka was bothered as to why she was holding that but, honestly Origami was not someone that made her happy when she encountered her, but there was nothing in particular that she wanted to talk about. *Pui* Tohka turned her face away and walked towards her targeted location.‐but,</p>
<p class="null-p">"…nu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka frowned dubiously. Origami was following Tohka's back silently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu, why are you following me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am not following you or anything. We're just heading the same way."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, replied back without changing a single part of her expression. Tohka made the wrinkles between her brows even deeper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…you, don't tell me you're planning to go to Reine's room."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka said that, Origami twitched her eyebrows for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Tohka was also, heading towards Reine's room‐in more accurate terms, she was planning to go look after Shidou who was resting in Reine's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just now she wanted to play with Shidou, and when she reached Shidou's room, she was told that he was taking a rest in another room because of his cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐to think that Origami also knew the same information as her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am more than enough to look after Shidou. You can go back to your own room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't joke with me; I'm the one who is going to look after Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do not think that is something possible for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, specifically what are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that kind of thing already determined, first off‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, started talking with full confidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Hiii* Shidou leaked out his breath. After Kaguya looked at his face lightly, she stretched her cheeks as if to strengthen her resolve and entered Shidou's futon cheerfully just like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai, Wait a second! What on earth are you‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…when someone gets a cold all they need to do is get warm, right? And Shidou, judging from the things I've heard, it looks like you love to share a bed with a girl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha…haah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou kept his futon with both his hands while raising a shout. Shidou was also a boy now that he thought about it. Naturally it was not something he would hate,</p>
<p class="null-p">but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,What is up with that. I don't remember saying something like that‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I wrong? My kinsman, said that you were in her futon when she woke up early on a certain morning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…sorry, there was."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied while twitching his cheeks. Most probably, rather there is no mistake, that so called "Kinsman" Kaguya was speaking of probably referred to Tohka. Last time because of Kotori, there certainly was a case where he was thrown into Tohka's futon while he was asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing such a reply from Shidou, *Fufun* Kaguya made a triumphant smile towards Yuzuru and nodded with satisfaction. And just like that, she resumed pushing into Shidou's futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no, that's why‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Shidou pinned down the futon as if to reject her, Kaguya "Ugu…" made her shoulders into the kanji shape 八.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I,I'm…no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! Tha,that isn't the…AhhhhMou!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, made a troubled face and placed his hand on his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"with the gist of it, you have to get warm by sleeping together!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, *Fufun* made a sound out of her noise while confidently folding her arms .</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. She remembered Reine and Kotori, saying that it is important to keep warm when getting a cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Adding on, she liked the warmth when Shidou crawled into Tohka's futon and slept together with her. Although she was surprised at the sudden event at that time but, right now in his current weakened physical condition…well, it was special now.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami swung her head sideways in a given up state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected, you are unworthy for the role. You should quietly head back to your room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,What did you say!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As evidence, you have not prepared anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka glared at her while saying that; Origami lowered her sights to the pouch hanging onto her wrist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A medical thermometer, a cooling sheet, and also a towel meant for wiping his body was also prepared. There are no flaws"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu, Fuun! The towel is also prepared in the room right! Even that much I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that and Origami swung her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no point in doing that. Even if I wipe the sweat with great trouble, if it is the prepared towel, I can't take it back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu, Muu…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not understand a single word Origami said just now. She then rang her throat as if she was groaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's more, you do not understand something very important."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A very important thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Using the towel is the last resort."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Then you can't wipe his sweat if it is like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it was me I would."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami started talking plainly.</p>
<p class="null-p">While the battle between Shidou and Kaguya unfolded, this time Yuzuru, took a step toward Shidou with a calm and easy movement.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, *Bazaaa* she pulled away the futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaah!? What are you doing Yuzuru?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! That's right you, it's unfair for you to interrupt me from sleeping together with him".</p>
<p class="null-p">As if agreeing with Shidou, Kaguya who was trying to enter the futon made a criticizing voice. However Yuzuru was not in the state of stopping and caring about that and *twitch**twitch* moved her nose a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Confirming. Yuzuru can see sweating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"eh? Aah…oh yeah, a little I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a small nod while answering. In order to act as if he had a cold, even though it was night time he was covered in a thick futon in summertime. Naturally, he would sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pointing out. Your body temperature will drop because of the vaporization if you leave the sweat alone. You have to hurry and wipe it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…well, that might be the case but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, while Shidou was blankly staring in wonder , Yuzuru suddenly grabbed Shidou's yukata's awase"5C 5", and stripped him exposing his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru then fell on top of Shidou, stretched her tongue out and licked Shidou's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soft and warm, the wet feeling was creeping around Shidou's chest as if tickling it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the sudden event, Shidou unintentionally "Kyan!" let out a girlish voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yu, Yuzuru!? wai…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, whawhawhawhawhawha what are you doing Yuzuruuu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya matched up with Shidou and shouted, Yuzuru tore herself apart from Shidou who was gripping onto her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did that, Yuzuru licked her lips and made a puzzled face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Why did you stop me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh, why, what the hell are you doing !?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the best way to wipe the sweat, that's what my teacher taught me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou twitched his shoulders, from hearing Yuzuru words… somehow, there was only one person that came to mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">But anyway, his first priority now was to find a way to deal with this situation. After Shidou fixed his exposed chest, he then covered himself with the stolen futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And just like that, using the tongue to lick the sweat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,What's the point of that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka shouted while sweat was oozing out of her cheeks, *Hou* Origami sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel pity for your lack of sensitivity."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wondering why, although she was the one who was supposed to be the right, Tohka ground her teeth with an indescribable sense of defeat. However, she couldn't get overwhelmed by her opponent here. *Bun**bun* after Tohka swung her neck, she shook her throat as if objecting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bu,but in the end, sleeping together is needed after wiping the sweat off right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true, you have a point. Sleeping together is a very important factor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look at that! Even I am useful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However Origami, showed her denial again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even with that, just me is more than enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do,don't joke with me! I'm the one who's much better at sleeping together!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Origami's gazes met and *spark**spark* fireworks exploded all around them.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou covered himself with the futon, and as if she was waiting for this to happen, Kaguya went on all fours while lifting Shidou's futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…looks like Shidou prefers sleeping together with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. Yuzuru is much superior than Kaguya even in terms of sleeping together. If you want warmth then please allow Yuzuru."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's weird! Something is weird!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou became desperate and stopped them, Kaguya and Yuzuru stared into wonder blankly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…? Isn't skin contact the best way to get warm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Yuzuru have heard that is the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I,It is not a snowy mountain so, I'm okay alone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou grabbed tightly onto the futon from his chest, and said that as if trying to escape from them. In terms the appearance, it was like the heroine getting attacked by hoodlums.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, Yuzuru *Pon* hit her hand as if she was convinced about something and made a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then slowly stood up and she unraveled the obi that was tying her yukata together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya's and Shidou's confusion were piled together magnificently.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Yuzuru was not bothered and looked down at Shidou calmly. Peeking at her captivating skin and matching underwear worn on top and bottom from the slit of the unraveled Yukata, Shidou's heartbeat accelerated strangely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"wha, whawha what are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Speaking of which, teacher said there is no meaning unless there is direct skin contact if it is warming up"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is with that super theory!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when Shidou raised a scream-like voice, Yuzuru was not bothered and entered the futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then took Shidou's trembling left arm and slid it into the middle of her Yukata.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's face turned red and he shouted. Although he couldn't see it by himself but, there was probably smoke coming out from his ears and head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"wai, wha,what are you squirming around for!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ignore. It's okay that Kaguya does not know. It is an adult space inside the futon." When Yuzuru said that, Kaguya ground her teeth together in frustration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do, don't look down on meeee!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then placed her hands on her obi with vigor and *BASAAT* removed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's eyes stared into wonder. Since she purged her obi more vigorously than</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru, her Yukata got flipped up for an instant. What's more‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh,why are you naked Kaguyaa!?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Yes. Even Yuzuru was wearing a bra and panties under her yukata, but Kaguya was right now, not wearing anything at all. He closed his eyes in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! Shock. To go to that extent."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru was also opening her eyes in wonder in shock. After looking both of their reactions, Kaguya let out her voice while being confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Aren't yukatas, suppose to be something like this? Because what Tohka said was‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it may be the correct way but even so!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, Eeei, I don't care anymore…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After an excited Kaguya shouted in desperation, just like that, she dove into Shidou's futon.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then took Shidou just like what Yuzuru did, and used both her legs to entwine Shidou's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We,well…Shidou. Feel my healing powers…! I am warmer than the likes of Yuzuru. Look, Yuzuru has a somewhat chilly feeling!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. Kaguya is the one who has the lonely breast; there should be less calorific value."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuha…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Caught up in the dispute between the two of them, Shidou tensed his whole body while exhaling.</p>
<p class="null-p">But as long as he is imprisoned inside the futon, his body will be pushed from both sides. The gentle feeling of their skin clinging onto him, the feeling of breath coming to his ears, or the faint drifting smell of their sweat, if he were to feel all of that it would be bad. As expected it looks like he can't endure much longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Control. Kaguya, Shidou's face is turning very red."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say? Even though both of us are warming him up, are you saying we made his condition even worse?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hypothesis. The reason is probably because of a Kaguya allergy. Try taking some distance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"D,don't say it like someone is house dust!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Proposal. Leaving jokes aside, we must do something about this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do something…what are you saying we should do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Proposal. Speaking of which, while saying to touch directly, don't you think the skin contact zone is limited?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, when he thought Yuzuru said that, she released her hand that was entangled with Shidou's right arm unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Hoou*…he then relaxed a relief sigh. But in the next moment, Shidou stiffened his body once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was something simple. Yuzuru's hands started to unravel the obi that was tying Shidou's yukata together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai, Sto, wha,what!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou became teary-eyed and shouted but, Yuzuru's hand didn't look like it would stop. On the contrary, even Kaguya too had noticed Yuzuru's actions half-way, her face turned red while coming to strip Shidou's yukata undauntedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ki, Kyaaaaaaaaaa! Kyaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up, Silence! You're making it hard to strip!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. It's not like you're an innocent baby anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">The futon stirred relentlessly, and coming from the side *Poi*, the yukata Shidou was wearing got thrown out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Frankly speaking, he had no idea what was done to him. It was like a good magic trick.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the nightmare didn't stop there. The next thing that Yuzuru and Kaguya's placed their fingers on was Shidou's last fortress; his pants.</p>
<p class="null-p">"we,well…This is the last."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Affirmation. Let's do it in one go."</p>
<p class="null-p">While in an excited state their breathing was getting rougher, both of them inserted strength into their hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, Iyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's high-pitched scream, echoed across the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Tohka was facing opposite at Origami and was caught in a stalemate in the hotel corridor, she unexpectedly raised her eyebrows from hearing a scream like sound coming from somewhere and entering her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…nu? Didn't you hear something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That must be an auditory hallucination. You should take care of yourself and head back to your room. Leave Shidou to me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you saying that again…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka pointed at the plate Origami was holding with her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what is that plate!? That is exactly, not needed to look after Shidou right!" When Tohka said that, Origami replied back in a very natural state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is for Shidou's supper. When infected by a cold, you have no choice in any case but to apply energy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu,Fuun! You revealed your true character! The person that has a cold should be eating porridge!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Its true last time, she felt Reine and Kotori said that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Origami was not that much surprised, and replied back uninterested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When getting a cold, giving something good for digestion. Such a thing is normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…? Then why would you‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This will, be made into a paste state by me and will be poured directly into Shidou's mouth on the spot. There is no problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,what was that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka tilted her head. She could not find Origami holding any other utensil looking material with her; she wondered how Origami was going to make it into paste. And by directly what does it…</p>
<p class="null-p">While Tohka immersed herself in these thoughts, Origami started moving forward silently. She immediately opened her eyes wide, and grabbed Origami's shoulders in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"wa,wait! I'm the one who's going to look after Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let go of me. Shidou is waiting for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't joke with me, there is no way that's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, while Origami and Tohka quarrelled in the middle of the hallway, three shadows approached them quickly from behind and crowded around both of their surroundings while lowering their postures.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,what is it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Twitch* Tohka shook her shoulders, and looked at the female students that were spreading around her surroundings. They were faces she remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the Ai Mai Mii trio who were in the same room as Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey~ Hey~ both of you. Looks like both of you are working hard today too~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But in the hallway like this, it will cause trouble for other people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it is okay, how about entrusting that match to us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ai Mai Mii assumed a posture as if they were runners aiming for a theft, said that in order while moving left and right little by little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Origami, surrounded by the three of them looked at each others' eyes in curiosity.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen was clinging onto the wall of the hotel corridor, as if she was peeking. After confirming her target Yatogami Tohka entering the room, she used her finger and pressed the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is Adeptus 1. The target has been confirmed entering the room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Should we dispatch the 'Bandersnatch'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I request at least three units outside the room just in case. However, it looks like master sergeant Tobiichi Origami is also in the room. Just to be sure, please be cautious about the activation radius of the Territory."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. 'Bandersnatch' unit 1 to 3, activate."</p>
<p class="null-p">Obeying Ellen's orders, the Operator made the instructions.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Ellen was about to give out the next set of instructions,</p>
<p class="null-p">"HeBuu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She suddenly received something flying from the room towards her face, and toppled over on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh‐what was that."</p>
<p class="null-p">She raised her body while pressing her nose and her body stiffened in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, I was noticed…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was not that much damage, that single hit was unmistakably targeted right at Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">This should not be possible. Ellen shook her head at the thoughts in her mind. The 'Bandersnatch' had yet taken any action that stood out, and it was not like Ellen had done anything yet. No, however, if it is the Spirits perceptive abilities then…those kinds of thoughts, was filling Ellen's mind for an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever it may be, it does not change the fact that it was a critical situation. Ellen tried to evacuate from that place and‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Cameraman-san spotted~"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the carefree voice echoing from the room, her body was glared at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it's true it's true. You are Ellen-san right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't let her escape, secure heerrrrrrrrrrrr!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While shouting things like that, when Ellen was deep in thought those three girls came approaching towards her from the room, they started circling her as if they were surrounding her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I got surrounded! Ellen grinded her teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">She remembered those girls. They were the students lodging in the same room with the target.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen detested her own carelessness. Those girls were most probably robbed of their free-will from the Spirit. They were most likely in a controlled state. There was no other explanation for this strange behavior.</p>
<p class="null-p">During the time she was thinking about those kinds of thoughts, both Ellen's legs and hands were restrained by Ai Mai Mii, and she was carried into the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh‐what are you…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oi~ the cameraman said she also wants to participate too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Ai said those words, coming from the deep part of the room "Ooh!" Tohka's voice echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I will bury all of you together!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice courage!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She shouted and Tohka and Origami who were staring in the deep part of the room, made a big swing, they seem to have thrown something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I will let you! Cameraman barrier!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at that moment, Ai who was lifting Ellen's leg quickly let her hands go and shrank her body behind Ellen as if she was hiding. At the same time, at Ellen's face, a solid cloth like object made a direct hit consecutively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kahaa…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She released her breath as if coughing blood and Ellen collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E,Elleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnn!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay? Your wounds are light you know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get a hold of yourself, you have your family waiting in your hometown right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They said such things, the real culprits that used Ellen as a shield was, purposely showing themselves wiping tears away as if they were acting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside Ellen's confused consciousness, she confirmed the true identity of the object that made a direct hit onto her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…pillow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with Ellen's mumbling‐the war, had started again.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 6</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing the staff meeting, the homeroom teacher of 2nd year group 4 Okamine Tamae was stopping by the teacher, Murasame Reine's room, which was located right beside her own room.</p>
<p class="null-p">From what she knew, it looked like a student from her class, Itsuka Shidou suddenly fell ill and they had him rest.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be best not to wake him up if he was sleeping, but…just in case, she should at least check up on him and confirm the situation as a homeroom teacher. *knock**knock* Tamae knocked on the door conservatively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka-kun? I heard you've gotten a fever, are you okay?" And while saying that, she slowly opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sto,Stooooooooooooppppppppppppp!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While raising such a miserable shout, the said Itsuka Shidou jumped out from the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, he was naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"heh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, saw Tamae's face and made a shocked expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's and Tamae's scream, echoed throughout the hotel.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Cross-Counter Heart</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">The second day of the school trip began.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, arrived at the Akaru coast located at the northern extremity of Arubi Island.</p>
<p class="null-p">This coast that had been scrapped off due to the Space Quake on this island 30 years ago, it looks like a gentle arc from the view from above, and it would seem that it was called a cool name like the Crescent moon coast from guides.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no signs of any tourist-like shadows there.</p>
<p class="null-p">However that was only normal. Shidou was called and stopped by Reine when he was about to head to the changing room with everyone else, and by using a prepared rental car, he was taken to the private beach located at the edge of the Akaru coast.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would seem she had purposely prepared it yesterday, since there is a high possibility that the Shidou's capture might be interrupted by the other classmates when it was in progress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa…this is amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky is clear. The intense sunlight reflected on the high-transparent water, and made Shidou squint his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Shidou, in contrast compared to normal energetic young boys playing in a swimming pool, muttered with a tone similar to an old man, he then gently caressed the scratch wound made on his chest and cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, a slight pain ran through his skin and made his face flinch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouchouchouch…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Last night, the moment he opened the door in order to run away from Kaguya and Yuzuru, he was attacked by Tama-chan's slash fang.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to Kotori's Reiryoku, Shidou has gained a body that could heal itself no matter how serious the injuries he got but, it would seem that the ability is not subjected to injuries that can be healed by his own body's healing abilities. If he were to enter the sea in his current state, he would probably shed tears because of the severe ocean baptism.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, nonetheless‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Either way, it is not like I can play comfortably…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a sigh. As if to match up with that, a sleepy voice echoed through from the Incam equipped on his right ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Shin, it looks like Kaguya and Yuzuru finished changing their clothes. Are you ready?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Reine's words, Shidou made a deep breath before, answering "Yes".</p>
<p class="null-p">"…just as what I had explained yesterday, I handed Incams to the both of them. They seem to have not tried sea swimming before, so I am thinking of giving them many instructions. Try to match up with it as much as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…in order to avoid crossing our conversation and the advice I am going to give to the girls, I will be closing our communication line for now…is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I will somehow manage it …but honestly, it is a little uneasy though." Recalling back yesterday's incident, he made a tired bitter smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…well, it looks like you had various problem yesterday but, we will be saving to a certain degree today. Now then, mission start. Do not forget to compliment them on their swimsuit."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the end of those words, the communication connection was cut.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, the same time as that, he heard voices of 2 people coming from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…So you were hiding in a place like this huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Discover. Found you, Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was characteristic tones. There was no need to confirm it. Shidou slowly turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru were standing there just as he had predicted. Kaguya was wearing a black bikini with white lace decorations and opposite to that; Yuzuru was wearing a bikini with a white background decorated with black laces.</p>
<p class="null-p">To both sides, it was so suitable on them that it was infuriating. If these girls were to walk side by side on a beach, it would probably not end with one or two guys approaching them spontaneously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O, ou, both of you. It really fits you two. It's really beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou made a compliment to their swimsuit following accordingly to Reine's instructions, Kaguya opened her eyes wide with a red face as if she was surprised while, Yuzuru blankly looked down at her outfit.</p>
<p class="null-p">However in a sudden manner, Kaguya folded her arms together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku,kukuku…isn't that right isn't that right. But don't be mistaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Clothes at this level, would just be overshadowed by my charm"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks. Thank you very much. Yuzuru is very happy." Subsequently, Yuzuru made an obedient bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Confirmation. Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">And when he thought Kaguya and Yuzuru moved their eyebrows unexpectedly, both of them used their hands and poked their own ears respectively. Looking closely, Shidou saw the same type of Incam as his on the girls' ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…I see, acknowledged."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger. Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a bitter smile unintentionally. Since it was an unfamiliar action so it can't be helped but…it was not a strange scene looking at both of them being preoccupied with the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before long, Kaguya and Yuzuru separated their hands from the Incam, and faced back to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh Shidou. This Star Shine is quite unbearable, to me who has everlasting darkness placed inside my body. I allow you to apply the divine protection of the miasma on my body to repel the holy light."</p>
<p class="null-p">"heh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Please help apply on Yuzuru to prevent getting sunburn."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">He finally understood thanks to Yuzuru's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it was only after he realized that it was going to be trouble. That's because, to apply something to prevent sunburns would mean‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"fu…well then, I am counting on you. I am leaving my back to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya, was saying something that was obviously not meant for this kind of situation while, handing over the sunblock lotion to him. Subsequently, Yuzuru also said something similar to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Request. Please."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was thinking where on earth did they get something like this from but, he immediately understood. Just nearby Shidou and the others, a Resting space like area with parasols and leisure sheets were constructed. Most probably, Reine prepared it beforehand.</p>
<p class="null-p">After severely mixing their sights together, both of them lay face down under the parasol shade. They then unhooked their tops and, revealed their white backs to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E,eerr…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While looking at the both of their backs lying side by side, sweat was oozing down the middle of Shidou's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Applying this…would means that, he would have no choice but to use his hands and directly run it around the soft skin of a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thereupon, as expected whether or not they have gotten impatient, Kaguya and Yuzuru touched the Incam and started making soft voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oi, Shidou isn't getting hooked. Isn't this different from what you said?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Is there something wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh, this is bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows. Today's aim was, to increase the credibility of Reine's advice. If Shidou were to hesitate here, it would probably mess up the plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O,okay, I'm going to apply it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said that, Kaguya and Yuzuru faced towards Shidou for an instant before, making a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like Shidou somehow managed to end it without making Reine's advice useless. Shidou made a relaxed sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…so Shidou, it might be something that I don't need to ask but, of course I am going to be the first you apply it on right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Who is Shidou going to apply sunblock first?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…? No, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when he thought both of them were mixing their sights while still lying down, Kaguya suddenly grappled Yuzuru and rode on top of her after rolling Yuzuru's body over. She then raised her voice, while holding down Yuzuru's body with both her hands and legs to stop her from moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, right now. Bestow me with the divine protection of the miasma."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Careless. Ku…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya raised the side of her lips as if elated with victory and Yuzuru leaked an anguished voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, since they were in that kind of posture while their swimsuit tops were off, so Kaguya and Yuzuru's breast being pushed onto each other body's was somehow oddly erotic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hurry up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O, ou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a form of being overpowered, Shidou folded his knees at that spot and took a good amount of lotion on his hands before, touching Kaguya's back. At that instant‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh, Fuaa…"</p>
<p class="null-p">While making a sweet voice unheard until now, Kaguya's whole body twitched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!, So,sorry, was it cold?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It, its okay. Hurry…up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah,aah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, each time Shidou moved his hands, Kaguya would twist her body like it was ticklish while making, excessively sexy voices like "ah…", or</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hnn…".</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru too who was being held down by Kaguya, looked at Kaguya's reaction and "Oou…" let out an envious voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Yuzuru immediately moved her eyebrows in a sudden manner and by taking advantage of the small chance made by Kaguya, she then rotates her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Return fire. Chance taken."</p>
<p class="null-p">"guh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time Yuzuru became the one holding Kaguya down who is now lying face up, Yuzuru turned her eyes towards Shidou. Kaguya who had taken a mount position, looked like she did not have the composure to retaliate against Yuzuru and was *haa**haa* breathing heavily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Shidou, hurry please give… Yuzuru too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh…!? O,ou"</p>
<p class="null-p">He knows she was referring to the sunblock but, towards that oddly sensational sentence and that pose, he mistakenly had a strong heartbeat. When Shidou somehow managed to calm his heart down, he started applying lotion onto Yuzuru's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Twitch. U…aah,h"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, Yuzuru let out breath from her nose in small intervals and made a voice as if she was being squeezed to death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou then nervously with a manner using his hands and when moving his hands accordingly to the muscles around her spine, Yuzuru's body suddenly sprung up as if she finally could not stand it anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E,eerr…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Admi…ration, Shidou, you have…very good skills."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no fair! Next is me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya who looks like she has finally regained her breath raised her body, and reverse their positions.</p>
<p class="null-p">But when Shidou started to apply the lotion again, she would start to raise a lovely voice and shake her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Re…taliation…would not let you."</p>
<p class="null-p">This time Yuzuru was the one who twisted her body and made Kaguya's back get attached to the leisure sheet. The lotion that was excessively applied was flowing onto the sheet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why you, what are you doing…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But this time Kaguya did not let it end with her losing. She immediately grabbed Yuzuru's hand and got back into a mount position.</p>
<p class="null-p">After repeating the same thing over and over for some time, probably slipping because of the lotion, both of them were in a manner where they are respectively in a lying down on their stomach position on the sheet and was glaring at each other. "Errr, in this situation…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou joined his hands together to apply the lotion on the other hand and ran his fingers along both their backs which were lying face down on the ground and lined up at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that‐"‐uh, A,Aaaaaaahh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After the both of them raised a loud voice, they relaxed their hands and legs on the spot completely exhausted and started breathing heavily as if they were sprinting with full-strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ar,are you okay, both of you…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of their vacant eyes met with each other, when Shidou said that while being confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…This from, being unwary of it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shudder…it's the fingers of god…what an unthinkable wolf", "Hu,huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it looks like a message has been transmitted from Reine at that moment. After both of them pushed the Incam at the same time, they started to make small nods after rearranging their berthing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu, fumu, next would be…watermelon splitting…? have Shidou blindfolded…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Con…firm. After spinning around and getting dizzy, wait for the direction…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai, wait a sec! What are you planning to do!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unbearably he shouted‐Shidou moved his shoulders with a twitch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Different from Kaguya and Yuzuru's, he felt as if he heard a voice from somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought it was Reine's voice coming from the incam in an instant but, no. Yes, this is‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh,Tohka…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou called out the name whose voice he had heard before and he turned around in shock. Although there was only the ocean expanding into his view but, he was certain he felt the voice was coming from that direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking, he found Tohka swimming towards him from the open sea, while making tremendous splashes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the form was reckless, she was extremely fast. Incidentally coming from behind, he caught a glimpse of Origami swimming with a beautiful crawl.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">From the coast, Ellen, who was observing the target Yatogami Tohka, was making sighs while massaging her right shoulder. It was quite a while since she did vigorous exercise without the Territory, and it had become a light muscle ache.</p>
<p class="null-p">…In the end, she was dragged yesterday into the pillow fight late into the night and along the way she had gotten tired and fell asleep together with the target.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today for sure, pulling herself together, she was going to observe the target. But, as expected, there were a lot of people in the middle of the day, so it didn't seem like the target would be alone. Waiting for tonight would probably be better‐</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of thinking crossed her mind. And,</p>
<p class="null-p">"hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen's eyebrows frowned doubtfully. The target that was just now looking around relentlessly in panic was unexpectedly heading towards the ocean. "Oo Shidou, you are in such a place!" she shouted that and entered the ocean.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, if that was only the case then it would be good but‐the problem was, the target (And for some reason, Tobiichi Origami too) was swimming in a straight line just like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Arbatel'. Where is the target heading towards to? Can we follow her from here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ellen faced towards the Incam and raised her voice, the voice of the operator immediately replied back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have confirmation. It would seem, that she is heading to the opposite side of the coast"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The opposite side of the coast, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Ellen recalled back the map of Arubi Island which she was on right now. It was certain that Ellen and the others should be on the edge of the arc coast that looked like a crescent moon. Although she could only see a little, the line Tohka and the others were swimming on, was exactly on the course that connects both of the coast's edges.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something on the coast they are headed to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would seem that it is a private beach. We are able to confirm 3 people, male and female there"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing that, Ellen licked her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she did not know why Tohka and Origami started heading there, this was a good opportunity. Unusually, there were less people in this swimming area which was opened to public and she could expect testimonies of the target swimming out to the open sea. This was probably the ideal chance to treat it as a gone missing scenario.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will immediately head there too. Please make 'Bandersnatch' follow me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing the reply, Ellen took along the camera that was made into a stand onto her shoulder, and stood up straight on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oo, camera-san! Here here over here, take a picture take a picture!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly called from behind, Ellen took a single glance towards that direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">She saw a bunch of boys and girls over there having fun with the sand on the beachside. There was a boy with his hair hardened up from wax being buried in the sand, leaving only his head and below the bow. There was also a weird body taking a weird pose made out of sand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally the worst thing was, in his surroundings, she saw the 3 girl students from yesterday who dragged Ellen into the pillow fight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am very sorry but, I am‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it okay, Ellen-san take one picture"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't we friends that gone through a hot night together"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Haaa"</p>
<p class="null-p">After making an annoyed sigh, she set the camera and carelessly pressed the shutter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this okay. Well then, I am in a hurry so"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh, come on take more"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I closed my eyes just now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, where are you going? Let's play"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Ellen was about the walk away while ignoring them, Ai Mai Mii stealthily came from behind and gotten close, they then took the camera that was being held on Ellen's shoulder and ran away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!, what are you doing. Please give that back"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noo, I feel bad for you having to always taking the photos, I will help take some of Ellen-san too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th,there is no need. Please give that back"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay it's okay, you don't have to restrain yourself"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am not restraining myself. I have something important to do so‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hai~~, lead our precious customer to her seat~"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time Mii said that, all the students from random directions grouped together and lightly carried Ellen's body. They then brought her to the beach-side just like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they did that, at the same time with that Ai Mai Mii grabbed a shovel with their hands and, *ZaZaZa* when she thought a human sized hole was dug out in the sandy beach in a flash, Ellen was thrown inside it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, what on earth are you…! Rather, aren't you people digging a little too fast!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu! We practiced high-speed hole digging in the back of the hotel until the ground was full of holes yesterday!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like a sandy beach, to us now is like digging into tofu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, you guys, do it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with Aii's leading command, Ellen's body was buried with sand all at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah Puuh…wha, ple,please stop!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Resisting in vain, Ellen's body was completely buried under the sand. Incidentally on the piled up sand, a body-like sculpture was made on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…this is troubling. Please let me go"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maa Maa, don't be in such a hurry"</p>
<p class="null-p">"One picture for now, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We will add more volume to the breast so‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she lowered her sights to her body, there was an odd amount of sand piled up on her chest area exactly to what Mii said.</p>
<p class="null-p">…it was a completely unneeded assistance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally when she looked at it closely, below on her right side, she was able to confirm the face of the boy that was buried by sand from just now. Forget that‐the body made under Ellen's face was a Queen swinging a whip down and the boys was, a naked man on all four with his butt facing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And most probably in order to bring both sides together, Aii who was a little further away pressed the shutter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ellen twitched her cheeks, the boy that was buried‐if certain, his name was Tonomachi Hiroto or something‐his face was looking over towards this side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha Haa, was it…Ellen-san. This is a little problematic"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaa"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ellen gave a spiritless reply, Tonomachi cheek's lightly blushed while continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How should I put it‐no, haha, I wonder can this kind of things be also, called…fate"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the first time in her life she ever felt like spitting on somebody else.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka and Origami reached the coast, they jogged towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally their outfits were the swimsuits that Shidou bought for them last month. Tohka was dark colored while Origami was a white bikini. Both of them were worth trying on, it matched them greatly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, you were in a place like this! I was looking for you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou. Why are you together with the Yamai sisters?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, Tohka said that cheerful while Origami said it suspiciously. Shidou made a wary smile as if to ambiguously deceive them and took a step backwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, well…about that, ahaha, truthfully speaking, I got lost…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment, somehow managed to correct their breathing, Kaguya and Yuzuru who had their swimsuit tops fixed let out their voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hou? Isn't it Tohka. Kuku…for you to come to your owner's side, what a cute fellow. I give you my compliment"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wonder. Master Origami, why are you in such a place"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, there was talk about Kaguya and Yuzuru being a burden in Tohka and Origami's room respectively. It was not surprising that both of them have remembered their faces… well, whether it was master or owner, he was a little curious as to why those kinds of titles that did not sound much like what a friend should be using was being used.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ooou, Kaguya is also here too. What were you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"kuku…right now, crushing something with the outline dyed with darkness and dark green until its crimson red blood and organs burst out, we are about to proceed on playing the devils game"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what is that. It sounds scary"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explanation. Kaguya is about to play split the watermelon‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Wait, for a little longer"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, in the middle of Yuzuru's words, a sleepy voice can be heard coming from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking over and over there was, Reine wearing a parka over her swimsuit. Probably because the sun rays were strong, she squinted her eyes while making a shade with her hand and her head was wobbling. She looks like an anemic patient that looks like she would fall at any moment but…well, Shidou knows that was Reine's usual condition.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!, Reine-san…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows doubtfully. Right now Reine, was suppose be giving out advice to Kaguya and Yuzuru through the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru were probably having the same doubts, they stared at Reine strangely and touched the Incam equipped on their ears with their hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry but, I forgot to prepare the watermelon.‐instead, since the number of people increased. There is a court built there. How about beach volleyball?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, she pointed towards the end of the beach.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first Kaguya and Yuzuru were unhappy but after a while, they seem to have immediately understand that the objective had been changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun, alright. No matter what I do, it is decided that I will be the on standing on top"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. Yuzuru doesn't mind. Yuzuru is the one to win anyway"</p>
<p class="null-p">When their eyes met after saying that, although it is not a race but, both of them ran at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Tohka started to run as if she was inspired by that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was sending her sights towards Shidou and Reine as if she was not convinced enough but, she probably guessed that there was nothing to gain from asking anymore and walked towards the beach.</p>
<p class="null-p">And as if to follow her, Reine and Shidou also started walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…so, Reine-san. Why did you suddenly come out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah. It's because the irregulars known as Tohka and Origami appearing has occurred. So I had plan switched to plan B. We might be able to do something about it if we use the 'Ratatoskr' 's organization members but…as expected there is a limit if I am the only one"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Plan B, you say"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, by fighting together in the same team, from the unity of you and those girls, it's a plan where you increase your relationship"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the same team…I wonder will those two quietly team up together…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…well, I have an idea for that. Just look"</p>
<p class="null-p">After having such a conversation, Shidou and the others reached the magnificent beach volleyball court constructed on the beach.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that Reine her body leaned over and took a tube-like object that was leaning against the pole.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…now then, let's decide on team separation. 3 people in one team. Please pull a lot"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Starting from Tohka, the tube entrance was pointed towards her and she pulled a rod that was inside it. Shidou hit his hands as if he got it. There was no mistake that those lots are most probably set up so that Kaguya, Yuzuru and Shidou would be in the same team.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…well, Shin too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told that, he pulled one out from the remaining two.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, he brought his eyes towards the tip of the lot and‐Shidou, "heh?" made a stupid look.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, on it was not a symbol or a number, but a drawing of an overly exaggerated man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…well then, the people that pulled out Gregor, Jackson, and Spenser come over here, while those who pulled Alexander, Abraham and Anthony, please go to the other side of the court"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reine, this one is who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Origami showed their lots to Reine as if they were troubled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, this one is Gregor. That one is Spenser"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next Kaguya and Yuzuru did the same thing and showed theirs to Reine similar to before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…you two are Alexander and Abraham. Please go around to the other side"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked at the exaggerated man (most probably Anthony) once more with half his eyes closed… he could not tell the difference from Tohka's and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Team A…Kaguya, Yuzuru and Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Team B…Tohka, Origami and Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya, Yuzuru, Tohka and Origami. 4 people of 6 were not satisfied with the team organization originally but, just by one word "I will tell the winning team a secret that Shidou never wants to be found out by someone else" from Reine, the match started. Shidou's protest with his almost crying face was not accepted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay! Let's do it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka raised a cheerful shout, and released the service shot from the edge of the opposite court.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐"Wha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Bohyuuuuuu! The ball easily penetrated the net together with that sound, and progressed like a bullet. Shidou immediately moved his body towards the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the ball pierced to the spot where Shidou was just now,</p>
<p class="null-p">GyaGyaGyaGyaGyaGyaa! It danced on the beach like a coma before finally stopping.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reine! How many points was that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…0 points"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Muu, technical skill points were not added huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…most probably but, I think you are mistaken with another sport" Probably after looking at Tohka's attack, Kaguya raised a low laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…not bad. It looks like I have to get serious too‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you don't have to. You don't have to!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was going to be exchanges of those types of balls then, even if he had multiple lives it won't be enough. Shidou shook his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun, boring. Well whatever, next is our service right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that said, Kaguya stretched her hands towards the ball that was dug into the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with an unexpected beautiful form, she shot the ball towards the opponent court.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oou, Its coming!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't disturb"</p>
<p class="null-p">Stopping Tohka's movement with her voice, Origami received the ball.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine who was standing behind her when that happened, made a beautiful toss. During that occasion, Reine's breast which was proud of its tremendous mass bounced up and down and Shidou's eye were unintentionally pinned onto that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Warning. It's dangerous"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told that by Yuzuru, he immediately opened his eyes wide. By the time he realized it; in front of him was Tohka who had made an energetic jump enough to cross the net.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with a loud shout filled with energy, Tohka hit the ball with the palm of her hands. Standing there blankly, Shidou was grazed on his cheeks by the bulletlike attack coming from that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, Don't daze away, Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. You're hindering"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru's voice echoed from behind. It would seem, they made a slide in order to get the ball.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, since they reached the same spot at the same time, both of them *Bam* knocked each other on the head and fell down on the spot. During that time, the ball bounced inside the court and *roll**roll**roll* rolled on top of the sand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuhaa! Wha,what are you doing Yuzuru!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. That is my line. Please do not disturb me"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru pressed on their foreheads while glaring at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Okay Tohka, that was one point"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oou! Really!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In regards, the other side of the court was lively. Tohka and Reine *clap*, made a high five. Although Origami looked like she ignored it but, her hand was taken by Reine and was forced to participate.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, not stopping to bother about that, Kaguya and Yuzuru continued their quarrel with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was my territory no matter how much you think about. Don't do anything extra!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. I thought that the simpleton Kaguya would not make it in time"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, What did you say you bastard!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Return fire. What is it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O,Oi, both of you calm down…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, at the same time when Shidou went between the both them to separate them, Reine from the opposite court, whispered something into Tohka and Origami's ear. When she did that,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hou, I get it now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I will definitely get the promised thing later"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying things like that, Tohka and Origami arrogantly looked down at Kaguya and Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu, what, Kaguya and Yuzuru isn't that much of a big deal!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A let-down. To challenge me when you are at that level, you don't know your place"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards those obvious provokes, Kaguya and Yuzuru responded with a twitch.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once more, Reine softly whispered into Tohka and Origami's ear again. Although a little…"more foul languages. You are supposed to do it like that when the time comes" he felt that he heard something like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya is a weak bug and Yuzuru is hopeless! Both of you two joined together are useless!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You XXXXX's. XXXXXXXX should just XXXXXXX. It is suitable for loser's son of a bitch."</p>
<p class="null-p">An excessively childish insult and an excessively bland abuse were falling over from the other side of the court.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards those two's agitation, Kaguya and Yuzuru quietly narrowed their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hey Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. Is there anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…wanna do it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Let's do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them mixed their sights together with a glance.</p>
<p class="null-p">But having the next service, after Origami took the ball with her hands in an extremely calm manner, she shot it towards the corner of the court with a beautiful form.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuzuru!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. I know"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yuzuru slide by the time she was almost finished and received the perfectly close service.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then hit up to Kaguya, who returned it back to the opposite court just like that. It was a beautiful combination play, enough to think that the shameful sight from before was a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the opposing team was not losing. Origami hit up the approaching ball.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Teacher Murasame"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Aah, I know"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next thing after that, Reine *ton* lightly toss the ball. It was the exact same pattern from just now. When somehow managing to brace himself in order to avoid being preoccupied by the breast, he saw Tohka once again jumping high up. "Oooh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She shouted, and released a sharp attack from the far away in a distant sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, stop it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya's shout echoed. Shidou joined his hands while in panic, and prepared for Tohka's attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, after the ball pierced straight towards his face instead of his hands, it then made a violent bounce high up into the sky just like that. The intense impact attacked his head and made his sights dance with glittering stars.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gueeh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay! Shidou will be taken to this team since the ball hit him right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no, I did not hear such a rule before"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could hear things like that from the enemy court. It looks like that was the reason why Tohka's ball had been aiming at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Praise. Nice"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was Yuzuru's voice that he heard inside his hazy consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Establish. Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru kneeled down on that spot and joined both her hands together and made the palm of her hands face upwards. And at the same time with the running Kaguya stepping on it with one leg, Yuzuru lightly threw Kaguya's body up to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He could hear Tohka and Origami's voice coming from the opposing court. The next moment‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya that had jumped high up in the sky, hit down the airborne ball‐it pierced towards the enemy court like an attack from an arrow. It was a really splendid attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay! Same point! Did you see that BASTARDS!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a manner as if she had forgotten her usual tone, Kaguya made a guts pose midair.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after landing and standing on the ground, she exchanged a high five with Yuzuru in an extremely natural way,</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Yahoooooo!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excited. Yahoo"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yaa! That was perfect Yuzuru. Byuun It went up Byuun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Positive. That was a magnificent attack. As expected from Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nono, that was Yuzuru's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, both of them twitched their shoulders at that point, and *fuun* averted their eyes away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun…don't get conceited you lowlife. Think of it as an honor to be stepped by my foot"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unpleasant. The smell has sticked onto my hands. It stinks. It smells like dried mackerel, natto"5D 1" and surstromming"5D 2" mixed together"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, it doesn't stink like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, they started quarreling as if they remembered. It was not a strange aspect at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou did not have the pleasure to carefully observe it right now. While hearing shouts like "Shidou! Are you okay!?" Echoing inside his head, the remainder of his consciousness sank into the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch Ouch…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was rubbing the bump made on his head while, walking sluggishly towards the toilet established at the beachside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, the moment when Shidou said he was going to the toilet, there were a few of them saying that it was dangerous for him to go since he was out-cold just now so they said "I will follow" and tried to help him but, he vigorously refused by politely rubbing his head against the sandy beach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Are you alright, Shin?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, he heard Reine's voice coming from his right ear. Shidou opened his mouth while making a wry smile as if he was tired.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…somehow. How is it on the other end?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…honestly, I still can't say anything. What's left is to agitate their opposition as much as possible but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, Reine suddenly cut off her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reine-san? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He asked while raising his eyebrows but, he immediately found the reason out.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because right after Reine shortened her words, Kaguya popped her face out from the side of the toilet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya…? What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be waiting at where the others are?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…I who holds the divine protection of the hurricane, that kind of distance has no meaning to me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…well that might be true. I was asking about the reason</p>
<p class="null-p">though…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said until there, Shidou immediately was taken back. He slouched forward while shouting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, I told you I don't need any help!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya's face turned red, right after she went blank for an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, I said it following the flow at that spot! Don't take it seriously!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, is that so…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that obvious!? Wh, why must I your…errr…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya hang her head in shame at that point and shortened her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aa! Anyway, I am here for another matter!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O,ou…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He nodded unintentionally. Shidou then lowered his voice and sent his question towards the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reine-san, is this an instruction from your side?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no, I have not said anything"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, while Shidou and Reine was having a conversation, Kaguya called out to him as if she had gotten irritated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't ignore me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"aah, my bad"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou returned his posture back to normal in panic, he then faced back towards Kaguya. But…speaking of which, there is one thing that he was wondering. He stared at Kaguya's face while scratching his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way…are you going to continue using that tone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya made an Oh no face.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then made a cough and cleared her throat awkwardly and took a cool pose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…you have been deceived by my antics. I find you dancing on the palm of my hands very humorous"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…what is with those eyes"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya made her lips go *buu* in displeasure. Shidou made a powerless wry smile while scratching his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…I was thinking about why you would especially force yourself to use that</p>
<p class="null-p">tone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did not force myself! This is normal!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's back its back"</p>
<p class="null-p">"hah…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he thought Kaguya made a shocked face, she then made a sigh and muttered softly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…that's because, it's that. Since I am a Spirit. Aren't I like super powerful?</p>
<p class="null-p">Then there should be some dignity similar to that, isn't something like that needed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…is it something like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought his eyebrows together and *u,un* groaned. He had met many Spirits until now but, he felt as if there were no such girls before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well isn't it obvious. Since I have a cool origin of birth and, I have a tragic circumstances prepared you know? Then I have to have a personality around that level"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well…if Kaguya is okay with it then it's okay. So? What's the matter?" When Shidou said that, Kaguya "ahh" made a nod before continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Its kind of troublesome so I'm going to continue like this, right now me and Yuzuru, are having a battle for you right? So, it's about tomorrow's conclusion", "aah…I guess so. Wait, you, don't tell me. As expected isn't that kind of sneaky?" He frowned, thinking that Kaguya was here to set a groundwork for herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">but Kaguya, spit out a totally unexpected line.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou. Tomorrow‐choose Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards those words that were not in his assumptions, he blankly opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't, heh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya shrugged her shoulders while continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There isn't any point to worry about right? That's because, she is super cute. Although she a little unsociable but, she's obedient, her breasts are big, and she is like a super Moe-like character shaped from guys delusions? And what's more, if you choose her, she would most likely give you lots of services right? There is nothing worth not choosing. That's why‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wa, wait a second!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was sorting out his confused head while, stopping Kaguya words. He couldn't understand what she was saying. No, he could understand the contents of those words. But, choosing Yuzuru tomorrow would mean‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya, you…said that the winner of this match would become the Yamai's main personality right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, I said that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"… You said the loser, would be consumed by the winner and be erased right", "Un, yeah"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, why‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that as if he was squeezing it out from his throat, Kaguya scratched her head while making a troubled smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unn‐…well even I don't want to disappear. But, more than that‐I, want Yuzuru to live. I want her to see even more things, and go all out and have fun in this world"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh, you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Shidou groaned painfully, Kaguya did not bother about it and continued her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, everything would have been solved if you had not barged in at that time. I was going to make a flashy clash and I will "Get defeated" get downed and everything was supposed to end"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya pointed her fingers at Shidou while saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's face distorted. A detestable pain as if his heart was being pulled out, was swirling around his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th,then, the first one to make me fall for them is the winner is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, that? Well that, isn't it obvious Yuzuru is the cuter one. If it is this match, there should be no mistake that Yuzuru would win right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was about to finish, Kaguya moved in front of Shidou in an instance and used her index finger to block Shidou's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did not really ask for Shidou's opinion. All you have to do for tomorrow is say Yuzuru is much cuter, lovely lovely Yuzuru-tan hahaha… if not, I will blast this island away together with all your friends"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya narrowed her eyes in the middle of her words and said it in a low voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou *gulp* gulped. The threat that he had forgotten until now, was revived by that sight and words.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was standing there nervous without moving, *Fuu* Kaguya loosen her expression and pulled her legs away.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then *turn* she turned her body facing direction and took on an excessively cool pose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…well then, I'm off human. The exchange in that occasion was aFlame of purgatory blood pact. Know your body will be scorched by the Feegefoia franme right down to your medulla if you fail to keep the pact!" She said that, and Kaguya ran away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou could only stand still on that spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Shin"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while. He twitched his shoulders from Reine's voice echoing through his right ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reine-san, that was‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, I heard. This has…turned out into something difficult. If that was Kaguya's true feelings instead of a strategy…then tomorrow, there might be a chance Kaguya would not react to the kiss even if you stir her up.‐in order to let Yuzuru win"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…guh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clutched his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Its true there's that. It is a grave situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, more than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya's determination to let herself die in order to let Yuzuru live‐was heavily, hanging onto Shidou's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he can't let himself continue getting dumbfounded here. Shidou started walking by dragging his heavy legs. If he were to stay missing any longer, Tohka, Origami and more importantly Yuzuru would get suspicious‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop. Shidou, please stop"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly a voice came from his back, and Shidou twitched his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was unmistakably Yuzuru's voice. For an instant, he thought that it was an auditory hallucination but…it was wrong. Wondering when she was there, Yuzuru was standing right behind him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yu,Yuzuru…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. Yes, is what Yuzuru replied"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a voice that has no accent. In a calm behavior. In an extremely calm manner, Yuzuru nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,whats wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked her while having sweat flowing from his forehead, *Fuu* Yuzuru turned her face towards the direction Kaguya ran off to and quietly opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question.‐with Kaguya, what did you two talk about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gasped. His heartbeat that had calmed down was once again throbbing roughly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did…errr"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Shidou was being immersed in his thoughts, Yuzuru made a small shrug with her shoulders while sighing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take back. No, as expected its okay. Yuzuru could guess pretty much"</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh, I,is…that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Affirmative. Most likely‐in the occasion for tomorrow's selection, she said to choose her right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…that is"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou about to release his words, Yuzuru used the palm of her hands and stopped him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Although Yuzuru don't care about that but, did Kaguya do anything during that time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…as in?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Example. Yuzuru is asking whether for example hugging Shidou and crawling her tongue around Shidou's nape or putting Shidou's face in between her chest or putting her hands into Shidou's swimsuit and touching your groin"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sh, she did not do something like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards those unexpected words, Shidou shouted unintentionally. Yuzuru *good grief* shakes her head as if she given up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Disappointment. Kaguya that's not good. You are too naïve. If Kaguya were to seduce properly, you would easily drop Shidou to the level of a monkey in mating season"</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like he was somehow being insulted but, more importantly Shidou felt Yuzuru's way of speaking was out of place.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because, Yuzuru's words were as if‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Yuzuru has a request for Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, as if to interrupt Shidou's thoughts, Yuzuru let out her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Request…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing a word like that, there were chills running up Shidou's spine. He unintentionally swallowed his saliva.</p>
<p class="null-p">His throat hurt and his heart beat started to pump faster. *babump* *babump*. His blood vessels quickly expanded, and the feeling was like his whole body was being poured with blood vigorously.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Shidou's mind was contrastively, as if intoxicated, was getting hazy. But inside that, there was only one‐the words he heard just a few minutes ago, were vividly brought back into his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. That is correct"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Yuzuru made a deep nod and continued her words without getting enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Appeal. Shidou, this match, please by all means choose Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">His voice did not come out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mostly likely at the point when Yuzuru appeared, he could already somehow predict the outcome.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at Shidou's reaction, Yuzuru tilted her head in doubt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Yuzuru feels that Shidou's reaction is out of place"</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh, no, nothing at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"request. More importantly, please. Tomorrow, Shidou must pick Kaguya. It's a promise"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-why…something like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explanation. Kaguya is much more superior to Yuzuru. There is no room for worrying. Even Shidou should also know about Kaguya's cuteness. Although Kaguya somewhat pretends to be tough, she is earnest, and has a fragile body that looks like it will break when touched and the feeling when hugging it could only be described as heaven. Most likely if Shidou chooses Kaguya, Kaguya would do a lot of things for you. By all means, Kaguya‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because, if Kaguya wins, then Yuzuru will‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Yuzuru cast her eyes downwards and nodded. The only things Shidou is thinking about now are all words that were thought over and over carefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya is the spirit most fit to be the true Yamai. Even Shidou knows about that clearly in this one day right? Kaguya is very charming. There is no reason not to choose her"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tha,that's because, both of you, were so competitive…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explanation. Although Kaguya looks like that, she is a shy girl. Unless Kaguya is stirred up, she won't appeal to you like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou became silent, Yuzuru walked closer to Shidou and whispered towards his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reminder. Tomorrow, please say Shidou would choose Kaguya. If not, misfortune will be brought to Shidou's friends"</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving threatening words similar to Kaguya's, Yuzuru ran off.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">"…" Reaching gathering time, Ellen who was finally dug out from the sand pit was sitting along the coast on the floor, grasping her knees while viewing the sea.</p>
<p class="null-p">The target had already come over to this side of the coast and has gone to the changing room in order to change her clothes. She had also passed by Ellen who just now was buried in the sand (The part of the body made by sand was changed and improved into the shape of a body builder), and unmistakably should have laughed while holding her stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, the boy Tonomachi who was dug out one step earlier than her, extended his hands in a respectful manner, but since it was irritating, Ellen threw him into the hole she was dug in, and filled it up once again with sand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Miss executive officer, errr"</p>
<p class="null-p">Coming from the Incam, the awkward voice of the operator echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm okay. Don't worry. This is nothing. I'll do my favored method in the night. There is no problem. I will catch her properly in the hotel"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I,I guess so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice of the kind operator was somehow the one that was tired.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 6</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no taste during dinner on that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not like the hotel chef took too much consideration on the guest's health or Shidou's sense of taste was dull. It was just simply because his mind wandered off somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing his meal without exchanging any conversations with the others, he was immersing himself in his thoughts absentmindedly while sluggishly walking in the hotel corridor.</p>
<p class="null-p">During daytime, the words Kaguya and Yuzuru spewed out was still swirling inside his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to let their other-self live, they chose to eliminate themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Shidou heard that, he was unable to understand those girls in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, for example.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Shidou does not sacrifice his life, then his sister Kotori would die.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most definitely‐he would, respond to that by shaking his head without hesitating.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not like those types of narcissistic motives, like self-sacrificing or devotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">But simply, without consideration, that was the only choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that kind of thing, that kind of option is still invalid then, his head would just only make judgments.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dou"</p>
<p class="null-p">No, not only that. Rather‐Shidou might be happy knowing that, Kaguya and Yuzuru think of each other to this extend. But‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oi, Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A loud voice was released at his ears and Shidou immediately opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, you finally realized Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, not knowing when she was there, Tohka in yukata state *Puff* bulged her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To,Tohka…how long were you there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have been walking beside you for quite a while"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Tohka stared at Shidou's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka *Fuu* averted her sights, she made a small smile with her lips and held Shidou's hands tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, if it is okay, why don't we go outside for a little?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The sea in the night‐I want to see"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that and pulled Shidou's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wai, wait a sec…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou braced his legs in panic and stopped Tohka's progress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, isn't it bad going outside on our own accord. The teachers should be coming to patrol about now too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that, Tohka stuck out her lips while *Haa* sighing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…sorry, Shidou. I made a little lie"</p>
<p class="null-p">"eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"err…how to put it, even though we came to the school trip, but for some reason…we haven't been talking with each other right? That's why‐together with Shidou, I wanted the both of us to talk"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am…not allowed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she made an upward glance while looking at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…no, that, is"</p>
<p class="null-p">If there is a guy that can say no after that, by all means he wants to see someone like that. In the next instant, Shidou was pulled by Tohka who has a smile in her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haai! It is everyone's long awaited Trump tiiiiiiiiiiiiiime!…and, aree?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Aii who jumped into the room while shouting, looked around the rooms interior while tilting her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the room, were only Mai and Mii.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aree, Where's Tohka-chan? And Kaguya-chan too"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she asked, Mai who was lying down and flipping through the travel guide and Mii who was having a boxing match with the string coming down from the light, faced towards her direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un‐, if it is Tohka-chan then she was together with Itsuka-kun. Isn't she getting cozy with him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also saw Kaguya-chan. She was hiding behind the walls and looking at them" Towards both of their words, Aii "HoHoo…" patted her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're kidding; don't tell me it's a love triangle? Kyaa‐ it somehow smells like an afternoon drama"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Aii made a mischievous smile, she then dropped her sights towards the trump on her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But well, if that is the case then we don't have enough people. I was thinking on playing Daifugou "5D 3" though"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Aii said that while shrugging her shoulders, both of them *ahaha* laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that is the case then we need 5 people"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about calling Yuzuru-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I did head towards her room but, it looks like Yuzuru-chan is not there too. Although I found Ellen-san but I lost her half-way. I wonder where everyone went"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Aii *Fuu* made a sigh, then how about, let's play shichinarabe "5D 4"? And started shuffling the cards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa, Haa"</p>
<p class="null-p">While sticking onto the wall outside of the hotel, Ellen was taking a breath to rearrange her rough breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then peeked back inside the hotel, and made a relaxing sigh after confirming no one was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…That was a close call"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking to herself in monologue, she then wiped the sweat of her forehead. After seeing the target Yatogami Tohka going outside with a male student. The moment she thought that this was a good chance and was about to follow them, coming from behind, "Ellen-saaaaaaaaaann! Let's plaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy!" The voice of her natural enemy echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then withdrew away from the area in panic, honestly speaking, her heart was still beating hard even now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We,well, no matter, this is a chance"</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking another peek at the hotel's condition just in case, Ellen extended her hands to the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Arbatell', are you seeing this? The target has distanced herself from the hotel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Time to commence"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And also…Please send one 'Bandersnatch' around this area, and have it on stand-by."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind but, why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is master sergeant Tobiichi inside the hotel. I think it is an unnecessary anxiety but…by any chance she is seen to make strange movements, I'm leaving the counter response to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger"</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming the operator's voice, Ellen stepped out into the dark night.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 7</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no one in the beach at night, the uproar in the middle of the day fall into silent as if it was a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, the private beach Shidou and the others were at, was quiet even in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Tohka, in a slow pace, were walking beside the breakwater while exchanging various conversations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"then, yesterday night, I had a pillow fight with Aii Mai Mii"</p>
<p class="null-p">"haha…did you seriously do something like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu. At first it was a match with Tobiichi Origami to determine who will be going to look after Shidou but, it became heated up half-way, and we did it until both of us became tired and sleepy"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I, I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a wry laugh powerlessly. If their match were to finish faster and either one of them had some energy left then yesterday night would most probably be another great disaster waiting for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">But no matter…how would you put it. Although they were exchanging a meaningless conversation with each other, for some reason his mood became relaxed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, after walking a little bit further ahead, Tohka suddenly turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So‐Shidou. What on earth happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being told that, *Babump* Shidou felt his heart jumping out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh, what do you mean"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, although I am not very sure about it but, something happened right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh, why do you think that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou asked, Tohka "unnnn…" touched her chin with her index finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow, I can feel Shidou is troubled. I guess‐err, at that time, the feeling was a little similar with at that time with Kurumi"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said that while groaning a little. Shidou opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tokisaki Kurumi. An evil spirit that kills humans under her own volition.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last month, Shidou was knocked into reality by finding out that girl's true nature‐and then, he was saved by Tohka's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, if there is nothing then it's okay. It might be because, I am thinking too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards Tohka's words, Shidou made a big sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that why, Tohka. For that reason you took me outside?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…well, that's. No, it is true I want to talk with Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said that while her cheeks were slightly blushed. That gesture was cute beyond belief‐and, gratefully, Shidou unintentionally loosen his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hey, Tohka. Will you hear me out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"mu? Umu, I will listen to anything"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka nodded. After Shidou made a nod, he started slowly talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's Kaguya and Yuzuru right? It is a talk that kind of sounds like a lie, in reality those two are‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While skillfully obscuring the charm contest and such, he explained that those two are spirits, are in dispute and…the loser will lose their life.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first Tohka was *Fumu**fumu* nodding but, immediately she made a shocked face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…that kind of thing is"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. And so‐ the main topic is starting from here. Actually…this afternoon, I was told by Kaguya to "choose Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…? That is absurd, if that happens then Kaguya will‐" Saying until there, Tohka shook her head a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but, I see. Me too, if I am told Shidou will die if I don't die then…I might also do that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka…"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_15.jpg">
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Tohka shook her shoulders in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu, no, nothing! Just continue!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A,aah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He continued after scratching his cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And… immediately after that, I was told the same thing by Yuzuru. She said "Please choose Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, opened her eyes in wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…then Kaguya and Yuzuru are"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…both of them are, trying to keep the other alive. Even if their own self were to disappear, Kaguya to Yuzuru, Yuzuru to Kaguya, they are thinking of wanting the latter to survive. And so‐how should I put it, I don't know what is the right thing to do"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Tohka *umu*, groaned and turned silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that for a short while, she frowned her eyebrows as if she was thinking very hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after a few seconds, Tohka started moving her mouth with a meek expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey…Shidou. This is what I think but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And‐at that moment. Coming from the front, the sound of a foot standing firmly onto the ground echoed and, Shidou raised his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then noticed a girl wearing a yukata there, and his body stiffened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Yamai Kaguya was, standing over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ka,Kaguya…!? Why are you here…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that…just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without answering the question, Kaguya released a silent‐but violent voice filled with anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuzuru…me? Hah…? I don't understand the meaning. What are you saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While muttering to herself like an internal monologue, Kaguya grinded her teeth hard, and clenched her fist. After she did that, as if to match up with that, a cold wind swirled around the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya, calm down‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While being pressured by uneasiness in his heart, Shidou said that. But, it looks like Kaguya completely did not hear what he said. She was only inserting force into her fist and her body trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐right after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!? Yuzuru…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou turned back from hearing the footstep coming from behind, over there was, Yuzuru was facing her face downwards performing the same thing as Kaguya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Demand‐repetition. Kaguya said…choose Yuzuru? Is what Kaguya said?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuzuru, listen to‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't screw with me…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, at the same time both of them released a voice similar to an angry roar, tremendous wind pressure was released from both of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Tohka who were just close to them, hit the ground with their backs from the sudden gust.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow managing to cling onto the nearby break water while raising his body, he then returned his sights back to those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">The intense wind current coiled about Kaguya's and Yuzuru's body and the clothes that were on their bodies turned into light particles.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, in exchange, a straightjacket appeared and tightened around their whole body and locks were placed on their neck, hands and legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">AstralDress. The absolute armor that protects the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more, it did not end at that point.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya's right hand, Yuzuru's left hand, both of them put them up to the front respectively.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they did that, an inorganic wing appeared on Kaguya's right shoulder. As if that was the starting point, a metal gauntlet that holds brilliance was constructed on her right arm‐and on the end of her hand, a giant lance that easily exceeds her body height appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Raphael' ‐"El Re'em"!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And in an exact timing with that, an inorganic wing grew out of Yuzuru's left shoulder. Her left arm is then covered in armor and on her hand; she grasped a string with diamond shape blade on its tip. It looks like a pendulum used for dowsing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Concord. 'Raphael'‐"El Nachash"."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya made a stance with her lance while Yuzuru made the blade attached to the tip of the pendulum float mid-air.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's face turned blue.</p>
<p class="null-p">The thing both of them manifested just now was unmistakably the "Angel". The Spirits prided strongest weapon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the interval of an instant, various thoughts coursed about in the inside of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't screw with me". The meaning of the word those two released. Whether it was something faced towards Shidou for leaking their secret‐or, was it faced towards Tohka for talking together with Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it looks like none of them were right to be accurate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya to Yuzuru, Yuzuru to Kaguya, both of them glared at each other with piercing sights and opened their mouth detestably.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…looks like you did something to screw with me, Yuzuru. Choose me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rebuttal. Kaguya too, what are you planning. Yuzuru does not remember requesting something like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with those words, the winds swirling nearby intensified even further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"it's no good. As expected, no good. I thought this battle method would give a quiet and reasonable conclusion but, I forgot to put your idiocy inside my calculations"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Consent. Yuzuru has lost patience to Kaguya's degree of foolishness. ‐In the end, it will turn out like this. The match both of us started, to let it end by the hands of someone else, it is just asking too much"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, both of them readied their lance, and pendulum.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess you're right. As expected, it looks like we have no choice but to end it with just the both of us. It's just right. Right now I am, at the highest point of my life pissed off at you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Return fire. Yuzuru too. Yuzuru can't hide her irritation and anger of Kaguya's thoughtlessness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"the duel method is"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naturally. That is obvious"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru once again opened their mouth at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐The first one to fall, Wins"</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing that shows that is.</p>
<p class="null-p">A conflict‐that will not end until one of them gets defeated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sto‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without hearing Shidou's voice of desisting, both of them clashed with tremendous wind pressure accompanying them.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 8</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, *Go**go**go*‐, when she thought the sound of the wind from outside resounded like the ground rumbling, the outer wall of the hotel *creak**creak* started creaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were various reactions coming from the students inside the hotel. Those who turned on the television to confirm the weather forecast, those who were scared of the storm and thus quickly covered themselves with the a futon and those nonchalant people laughing at the fact it was a good thing the storm did not occur in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nonetheless naturally, no one went outside the hotel on purpose to get blown by the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the exception of, Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Silently putting on her shoes, she placed her hands on the hotel door.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was plain and simple. When she was about to go look for Shidou just now, coming from Aii living in the same room as Tohka, she gained the information that she saw Tohka taking Shidou and heading outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's actions were swift. She knocked down Aii's hand who came to invite her for a game of trump, and while she was running towards the hotel entrance, halfway there she received a warning from Tamae "You should not run in the corridor". Origami's leg could not stop just because there was a storm.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was not pleased about Shidou and Tohka going outside together but, more importantly, in a storm like this, it is extremely dangerous to be outside of the hotel which is particularly close to the sea. She has to bring Shidou back as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is true the storm is strong but, it wasn't as strong as to not being able to walk outside. Origami proceeded on walking outside‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt a presence behind her and immediately jumped away from her spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, coming from the spot where Origami was at just now, *clash*. Such a metallic sound echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked at the thing that appeared there and slightly raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">A thing that has a human shape was standing there with its fist thrusted into the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a moment, Origami thought that was an AST personnel. In reality that equipment looks like a CR-unit that looks similar to the AST official accepted equipment, and she felt the slight headache of when the Territory is activated at close-range. There was most probably no mistake that it has the Realizer activated.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐no. The unit that was being worn by that thing was clearly not human.</p>
<p class="null-p">An inorganic exterior that makes one think that it has no life. It had crooked hands and legs designed only important for efficiency.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a human shaped machine that would generally be described as a robot or a doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What on earth…is this"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami said that as if she was squeezing her voice out from her throat. The Realizer, cannot be controlled if a human's brain wave is not used. For a human-type robot to use a Territory‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of thought was interrupted half-way. The mechanical doll leaped towards Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Avoiding at the very end, she took as much distance as she could.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Betting on the small hope she tried talking to it, but as expected the doll did not reply back. While not showing back any reactions at all, it came attacking with consecutive strikes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami dodged in paper-thin difference while, picking up a strange feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">As far as she could see, the doll was equipped with the basic equipment's such as the laser blade or the gun. But for some reason showing no signs of using it in response to Origami, it came punching bare-handedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like; it was trying to capture Origami unharmed‐just like it was here to prevent Origami to advance further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, don't disturb‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Avoiding by jumping backwards, Origami quivered her throat in detest. Even though danger was getting to closer to Shidou, she was stuck doing this.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus‐at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Tobiichi Origami, what are you doing. Outside is dangerous, hurry up and come back into the hotel"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami exiting the hotel was probably told by someone, coming from the direction Origami came from, the sleepy voice of teacher Murasame Reine echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensei, go back‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, faster than Origami finishing her sentence, the doll that was confronting Origami, *creak**creak* turned its head towards Reine direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hmm? who are you. I'm sorry but our student…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, she said that towards to the doll, Reine stopped her words. Most probably she finally, noticed the object she directed her voice to was not human.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it was already too late. The doll changed its target to Reine from Origami, swinging its log-like arm in full vigor, it charged towards Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami exhaled her breath, she immediately kicked the floor and pushed Reine away.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, the next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ka‐ha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Receiving a heavy strike in the stomach from the doll, Origami got blown backwards easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her side intensely hurt and her breathing became difficult. Her consciousness turned hazy and her eyes turned blurry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensei…hurry, run aw…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, with the image of the doll's shadow drawing near to Reine's back in her view, Origami's consciousness fell into the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 9</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh! Vice commander, around the vicinity of the northern part of Arubi Island, a tremendous storm has occurred!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with the alarm ringing in the bridge of the "Fraxinus" floating above Arubi island, "Deep love" Minowa shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A storm…occurred?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki who is standing beside the captain seat gently brushed his chin doubtfully. Wind is something from the flow of air. Normally, it is not something that suddenly occurs in a starting point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there any contact from Analysis officer Reine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki *Fumu* groaned. They were supposed to be contacted In case a problem occurs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please try by opening the line here once. It's okay even if there is nothing"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the crew member who started operating the console, immediately let out a doubtful voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The connection…won't connect. I'm afraid there is something blocking the communications!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fumu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki moved his eyebrows with a twitch. Even until making us attempt to open the communication line on this side, and the source of the blocking is still not detected, what on earth‐</p>
<p class="null-p">But, his decision was very fast. Without even waiting for a few seconds, he gave a command to the crew.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no choice. It is a little dangerous but, let's send the communication personals directly there. After lowering the altitude to 1000 meters, transfer the personals to the Arubi island northern block and conduct the communication via the deployed 'Yggd. Folium'. After that please confirm the safety of Analysis officer Murasame Reine, Shidou-kun and also Tohka-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Responding to Kannuzuki's command, the crew operated the console.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they did that, a low driving sound echoed across the bridge, and their bodies had a slight floating feeling similar to being inside an elevator.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without even needing a few minutes, "Fraxinus" descended to 1000 meters altitude in the sky of the Arubi Island from 15000 meters above.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have reached to the designated target. There is no reaction from the permanent Territory"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fraxinus" has 8 Control Realizer's and 10 large-type basic Realizer installed, normally the surroundings of the ship have the Territory deployed around it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that Territory then manipulate the visible light rays, making the giant ship body of the 'Fraxinus' invisible. Not only that, it was also made to automatically evade the moment a plane or bird touches the Territory to avoid collision.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, during the occasion of transferring machinery or humans to the ground from the teleporter located in the lower section of the ship or, when the independent unit 'Yggd .Folium' equipped in the back of the ship is activated, the invisibility will then be interrupted for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, whenever they use the 'Yggd. Folium' and make a communication relay point in lower altitude point, they would have to be careful and check whether there is an aircraft around to avoid having the 'Fraxinus' being sensed by its radar. "Okay. Well then, please activate the 'Yggd. Folium'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with Kannazuki's instruction, the invisible wall wrapping the "Fraxinus" slowly disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Similarly, on the altitude of 1000 meters above the sky of Arubi Island.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside DEM's 500 meter class airship 'Arbatel', the shout of the crew echoed across.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!, Captain, There is a reading on the radar!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"An aircraft?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…this is, an airship!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…what did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time with Paddington doubtfully moving his eyebrows and siting on the captain seat, the image of the sky was shown out on the main monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not an aircraft, unmistakably that was an airship. Behind the ship with a sharp form, there were several small heat sinks like object attached to it; it made him think it was a giant tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where on earth did it appear from"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The readings suddenly appeared. Most probably‐Invisible mode was used"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say? What's the identification number?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's unknown. We cannot confirm the ship model falling under the DEM Company" Paddington made a sullen face, and strokes his beard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"An airship that has Invisible equipped…? Impossible. The ability to turn invisible with the Territory was just made successful recently by the DEM industries"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Invisible is the DEM Company's completed latest Realizer the beta series of the 'Ashcroft' and it is the latest technology first implemented. The only ships that has that equipped currently are, only 3 ships with the 'Arbatel' included in the count.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, at that moment, the heat sink-like object detached itself from the ship being shown on the monitor, and floated midair independently.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in the next moment, the ship that was being talked about once again vanished into the sky as if it had finished its task.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! The reading disappeared!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The crew member who was observing the radar raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is without a doubt the unidentified ship had already used the installed Invisible function. Using his eyes, he has confirmed that function.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that kind of thing should not be in existence‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, don't tell me"</p>
<p class="null-p">Paddington opened his eyes wide in surprise. Speaking of which, he had heard of something before.</p>
<p class="null-p">The name of another organization that holds the Realizer besides DEM Company.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Ratatoskr' organization"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Paddington said that word, the crew members that were in the bridge gulped down their breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">DEM's second executives‐if it was the people affiliated in the shadow execution team of the DEM Company then, it was not weird that they have heard of that name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Paddington himself was told about that existence. ‐from that person Isaac Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pretext, there is an organization with technology more advanced than DEM.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pretext, there is an eccentric group that decides to settle the spacequakes with peaceful ways.</p>
<p class="null-p">our</p>
<p class="null-p">Pretext‐that is, DEM's enemy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By any chance it is spotted, immediately‐eliminate it"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Paddington released that from his mouth, *snicker**snicker* he laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, I have good luck"</p>
<p class="null-p">He stood up from that spot, and threw a command at his crews.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Prepare the main cannon! Put magic from 'Ashcroft-Beta' number 10 to number 20! The target is‐the unidentified ship!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh, Captain…it is better to ask for instructions from the executive Chief‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">A crew member said that with a distorted face anxiously. Paddington clicked his tongue irritated. Even more than Paddington, are you saying that young girl words are more important.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't mind that! If the 'Bandersnatch' team is there then it is enough for the executive chief's mission! If that is maintained then there is no complains right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, Understood…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if getting overwhelmed by Paddington's manner of speaking, the crew members started operating the console.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon enough a low driving sound echoed in the bridge and the 'Arbatel' changed its course.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cannon, magic charge complete!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Target, the area the unidentified ship disappeared to!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Invisible deactivate! Change the Territory property to anti-shock!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming the voices of the crew members, Paddington pointed his fingers towards the screen and said it as if he was muttering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fire"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time with the sound of rumbling, 'Fraxinus' bridge was shaking violently as if it got struck by an earthquake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noise ran through the monitor and the emergency call echoed loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, suddenly a response appeared on the radar screen, and on the monitor that was showing the exterior image, a giant craft appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ratatoskr' crew member‐Shiizaki Hinako instinctively used both her hands and covered her head. Towards the impact she had never experienced before, her head immediately turned into disarray.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was only natural. In reality, a part of the crew that were on the bridge showed the same reaction as Hinako.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is true inside 'Fraxinus', in case of an emergencies, it is equipped with weapons for battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">When joining 'Ratatoskr', they are explained that there is a chance such battles will occur, and they received battle training.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐at the very least Hinako had not experienced a real battle until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Left side port Territory, reduced by 20%!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Basic Realizer</p>
<p class="null-p">"AR-008 number 30 is losing its output!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The craft damage is minor! But, what on earth is this‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The shouts of the bridges crew member flew around and mixed together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tha,that was…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Hinako made a shrill voice, Kannazuki who was standing beside the commander seat, *fumu* used his hands and touched his chin. Even though that was such an intense shaking, his posture had not crumbled at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fumu, it looks like we are getting attacked. Even when approach this close and readings are still not confirmed, this means…that side is also usingour Invisible huh. This is weird. This technology should be impossible other than Asgard Company's Realizer…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heat source confirmed! A second attack is coming!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Opps‐Deactivate Invisible as well as Avoid. Please transfer all the generated magic from the Basic Realizer to the Protect Realizer to activate it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ro,Roger!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with the shout of the crew members, the properties of the Territory deployed around the 'Fraxinus', the Invisible changed to Protect mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, the shock inside the Bridge calmed down once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"kuh‐this power even with a protective barrier…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kawagoe who was sitting on the lower bridge, groaned while making a frown with his face. It was exactly as he said; it was an impact that makes one think the magic from the camouflage effect was not transferred to the protective barrier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To bring out such a direct attack, it looks like they have great confidence in their ships performance. Hnnn…this is nice, it makes me tremble. Aahh, make it more rough!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">…as expected this person is hopeless. Hinako opened her eyes half-way and operated the console at her hands reach.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ship will sink if this drags on. She opened the secret line and proceeded in making an emergency call.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before long, Commander Itsuka Kotori appeared on the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Shiizaki? what's wrong, using the secret line. What on earth happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's an emergency! I'm begging you Commander, please take command…!" After Hinako said it like a disaster was approaching, Kotori's face turned stern.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, Kannazuki made a strange choice selection and made Tohka's mood get worse again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's much more serious. If this goes on…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what I am saying, what happened… uh, don't tell me, Kannazuki directly went in and barged in on school trip, and made a strip show in front of Tohka or Shidou‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said that in a horrified state. *Bun**bun* Hinako shakes her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No that's not it, it's an enemy…! An unidentified airship appeared, and we are under fire! If this keeps up 'Fraxinus' will…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hinako said that to her desperately. That was only normal. That's because her life is being placed on the line.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the moment Kotori heard Hinako's words; she made a half-eyed look like she just lost interest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh…it's about that"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she then made a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I seriously thought that idiot went on ahead and done something stupid. Don't scare me like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, it's about that‐it's a serious case for the ship you know…!?" When she made a shout, Kotori spread her hands as if stopping Hinako.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay, you don't have to worry that much"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ho,how can you be so calm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Hinako said that in a hopeless feeling, Kotori shrugs her shoulder while moving her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because right now, Kannazuki is there right?"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: The Light that Splits the Wind</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">The forest that separated the Southern part and the Northern block of Arubi Island was being mowed down by a violent hurricane.</p>
<p class="null-p">Healthy green leaves and branches that appeared at the same time with summer were now being blown and ripped into bits, and was thrown up into the sky, spinning as if it was thrown into a mixer. Slender trees were being dug out and were being thrown around the surroundings like a bullet.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was exactly what the march of an outraged berserker means. The incarnation of violence without reason, was all one could see with their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who on earth could imagine this outcome.</p>
<p class="null-p">the main reason for that sudden storm was, brought forth from a big fight between two young girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought about this before! You burden yourself alone and plan to deal with</p>
<p class="null-p">it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kaguya was thrusting her giant lance while shouting, the tip of the lance spun with high-speeds like a drill and produced a tremendous tornado. She mowed down the lance pointing towards Yuzuru, as if she was going to clean sweep everything with the tornado.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. That word, Yuzuru will return it back to Kaguya with a present wrapped in excessive wrappings and have a paper card and ribbon attached on it…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Yuzuru, even though she was being approached with a cluster of destructive wind, she was extremely calm and made a complicated move with her left hand. When she did that, the pendulum Yuzuru was holding, squirmed around like it has its own thoughts and formed a magic circle in front of Yuzuru. After it easily blocked the tornado attack whirled up by Kaguya, it once again returned to string state and then turned into a spiral state wrapping Yuzuru's body surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are too kind! Since I am willing to hand over the seat of the main personality, you should just quietly accept it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reject. From the start, Yuzuru has no intentions to be the main personality"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, how many hardships did you think I suffered losing skillfully in our matches until now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. That also goes for Yuzuru too. Even though Yuzuru managed to gain losing marks, it is not once or twice Kaguya made Yuzuru irritated for not attacking back"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Yamai is the king of hurricanes that knocks down all creation! Aren't you the only one suitable to be that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Deny. That is a mistake. The true name of the Yamai, should be gained by Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh, even though you can fly faster than me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya is the one that has more power than Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you have better style than me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya has prettier skin"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you are cuter!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Objection. Yuzuru cannot yield to that. It is obvious Kaguya is much cuter than Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">While exchanging words that sounds like a quarrel or not, Kaguya's lance that was spinning in high revolution and Yuzuru's string that was complicatedly made into a sword clashed together. The power was completely equal. The moment of impact, the wind at the surroundings turned wild and attacked Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou curved his body while supporting Tohka, and somehow managed to resist it.</p>
<p class="null-p">If his body did not have the protection of a Spirit then Shidou would have probably been blown away by the wind by now. He was very confident of that because, the fight between these two‐to put it correctly, the byproducts in the sidelines that were dragged into it would suffer terrible damage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each time these two's Angels clashed, sudden gusts would spread around and surrounding objects nearby would be plucked out from their roots and blown away.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shidou shook his head as if to shake away these thoughts, and glared at both of them as he somehow resisted the wind and raised his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya wants Yuzuru to live, Yuzuru wants Kaguya to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them, thought this thoroughly about each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is‐for the sake of the other, one would throw away even her own life.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, why.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why‐did things turned out this way…!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised shouts that would only crush his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop! Both of you! You guys, don't you love each other very much!" He shouted but, there was no reaction coming from those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether it was because of the sound of the wind that Shidou's voice vanished or, they could only hear each other's offences and defenses inside their dreams, or‐they were ignoring him. Although he could not distinguish which one is it but, it is certain Kaguya and Yuzuru were still going to continue their intense fight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was too powerless. Shidou covered his face with his hands while grinding his teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou! Be careful! There is something here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Coming from his side, Tohka's voice echoed and made Shidou twitched his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then looked around at his surroundings‐and raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">During the few seconds Shidou was chasing Kaguya and Yuzuru with his sights.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to surround Shidou and Tohka, around 10 humanly shaped shadows were standing in a row.</p>
<p class="null-p">No‐wrong. Their bodies had limbs and a head just like normal human body but, their shape was obviously different than those of a human's.</p>
<p class="null-p">They have a range of slender body and smooth head like a full face helmet, they also have legs with joints facing the opposite direction compared to humans and it was stepped firmly into the ground. In opposed to that, their arms were large and it somewhat gave an unbalanced impression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting all of that in place was a glassy and smooth polished metal armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, he saw CR-unit looking parts on their bodies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,what…are these guys!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a hunchback-looking posture, he felt a mysterious unknown fear coming from the group of dolls that were gradually closing their distances, Shidou released a voice that sounded like a groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"DD-007 'Bandersnatch'…even if I say that, you still would not understand"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he said that, in response to the scream-like voice, a young girl walked out from the background of the dolls.</p>
<p class="null-p">it was the attendant cameraman, Ellen Mathers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ellen…san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nu, you are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Tohka and Shidou let out their voices at the same time, Ellen made an exaggerated nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You finally came to a place with no people, Tohka-san. It looks like there is one unnecessary person here but‐well, if that is all then it is still okay, I guess" She said that and took a glance at Shidou, she then snorted uninterested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, I am surprised. To think those two were Spirits.‐and what's more, it's the primary target, the 'Berserk's. It seems like they're good compensation for all that piled up misfortune"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He unintentionally frowned. ‐just now this girl called Kaguya and Yuzuru 'Berserk'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You…who on earth are you. Don't tell me you're from the AST…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"!, houu…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou shouted full of detest, Ellen moved her eyebrows as if it was the first time she found Shidou interesting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know of the Anti-Spirit team of the JGSDF huh. ‐but, sadly that is off"</p>
<p class="null-p">She hung out her hand after saying that and as if following with that, the dolls called 'Bandersnatch' lowered their posture all at once and leaped towards Shidou and Tohka's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou immediately gasped instinctively and closed his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, even after a few seconds, there was no impact running at his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">He slowly opened his eyes thinking it was weird, and over there was,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…are you alright, Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">Manifesting a limited Astral dress around her yukata, Tohka was there holding a glowing sword 'Sandalphon' in her hands. It looks like, the moment</p>
<p class="null-p">'Bandersnatch' leap over; she released the limiter for her Maryoku, and deflected the attack with 'Sandalphon'.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, looking at Tohka's state, Ellen, a little excited, opened her eyes wide. "‐'Princess'. It really is the real thing as expected"</p>
<p class="null-p">"uh, even Tohka's codename…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought his eyebrow roots together. Even though he had to stop Kaguya and Yuzuru as soon as possible, to think an unknown and mysterious enemy appeared here.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Ellen, as if she wasn't even bothered with what thoughts Shidou was having, stretched her hands towards Tohka's direction as if she were trying to reach her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka-san. Would you like to come together with me? I promise you will get the best treatment"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't bullshit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with Tohka yelling that, she pointed the tip of 'Sandalphon' towards Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O, oi Tohka, isn't using 'Sandalphon' towards a normal human a little too‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wrong"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After replying Shidou's question, Tohka continued talking while glaring at Ellen with a face covered with nervousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I noticed this when we are facing each other like this for the first time. ‐this woman, has a really bad feeling about her. Yeah…it feels like the AST aura growing darker to its limits"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, as if matching with what Tohka said, Ellen for the first time has made a smilelike face by making the edges of her lips go up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What an interesting remark"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Ellen leisurely spread both her hands as if she was taunting Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did that, a pale glow immediately covered Ellen's body, and after a moment, that body was equipped with a wiring suit and a CR-unit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her suit has a different form from those of the AST's. It covered the important areas of her body and the parts were meant to look like mechanical armor. And also, there was a giant sword-like equipment on her back, which especially drew his attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Bandersnatch' team, don't lay your hands for now. I want to have a little test to know how strong the 'Princess' I have heard about is."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she pulled out the sword equipped on the back of her right hand, and a sword of light manifested from the body of the blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to invite Tohka, *Gui*, the fingers on her left hand were bent and shown to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't look down on me…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shouting, Tohka kicked the ground and head towards Ellen. At the same time, she held up 'Sandalphon' and hit down at Ellen's head with a speed that can't be captured with his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐Ellen easily stopped that, with the sword held by one hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, is that it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting out an anguished voice, Tohka swung 'Sandalphon' continuously.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, all of the attacks were defended, and Ellen's unit did not even have a single scratch on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking on the sword strikes several times, Ellen made a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is that all you have, 'Princess'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐What did you say!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I even went as far to equip 'Pendragon' but‐it looks like it was not needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a disappointment. Let's end this."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Ellen swung down the giant laser blade at Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka prepared 'Sandalphon' to attempt to defend against that attack. But‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the next instant, dumbfounded voices were leaked out of Shidou and Tohka's throat at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was only natural. That was because, the moment Tohka took on Ellen's sword strike, the body of 'Sandalphon' that she made a stance with was easily smashed into pieces.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short anguished moment, Ellen's attack easily blew Tohka's small body backwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuaah…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's body was then grazed the ground several times, and fell down facedownwards. Continuing with that, delayed in one beat, the smashed and repelled away 'Sandalphon' turned into light particles and melted away into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To,Tohka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou shouted, he tried to approach towards Tohka. But‐on the directions towards her, two 'Bandersnatch' appeared and obstruct Shidou from advancing. There were several 'Bandersnatch' starting to swarm together, at Tohka's direction</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a kill-joy. Please make her faint quickly and bring her to the 'Arbatel'"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that Ellen snapped her finger and the armor decorating her body disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards, as if losing interest even on Tohka, she *pui* turned her face and crossed her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the predicament did not change. While still lying face-down and not moving, both Tohka arms were grabbed by two 'Bandersnatch' one on the left and the other on the right and her body was carried up. And when he thought one more doll walked towards the limp Tohka from the front, the hand that has claws growing out of it was closing in onto Tohka's forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gu‐aa…‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka let out a painful voice and twist her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka! What are you doing you bastards! Damn it, get lost!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he shouted, the dolls standing in front of him blocking his way did not move. During the time he was like that, a painful voice that sounded of anguish and shriek mixed together, echoed out of Tohka's throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised a scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">And absurd amount of powerless and despair feeling, overrun the inside of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Shidou could not do anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether it is stopping Kaguya and Yuzuru or saving Tohka from the predicament.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sealing ability that is inside his hands, was currently useless for this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only thing left was the healing ability borrowed from Kotori and the gained Spirit protection from Tohka and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, one more. If only he had the power to cut this doll into pieces so and through.</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, Kurumi's‐the face of the worst Spirit that kills human with her own will, passed the inside his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The feeling he had at that time, was the powerless feeling of not being to do anything. In the end…the despair from being unable to save Kurumi was running around in his brain.</p>
<p class="null-p">not again, I don't want to go through that again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou heard some kind of snapping sound inside his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't care if it is a one in a lifetime opportunity. I don't care if I only can do it once.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now in this hands, if I had the power to save Tohka‐!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohkaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant‐Shidou naturally, raised his right hand up.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he let out his voice dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he swung down the right hand that was raised up, the upper body of the 'Bandersnatch' standing and blocking in front of him, disappeared cleanly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And one more 'Bandersnatch' that was further front‐the head of the unit that was restraining Tohka's hand was, slide diagonally off its place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"*cough*…,*cough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This…is"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, in a state where he found the thing he was seeing unbelievable, looked at his own right hand. Over there was.</p>
<p class="null-p">When that happened, in a similar fashion where she was pulled, Tohka's body collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was holding, a sword glowing in light.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Set a Protect territory area towards 1'o clock, the coordinates 132-50-39. Radius 255-246"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ro,roger. Protect territory set; coordinates are 132-50-39. Radius 255-246"</p>
<p class="null-p">Repeating Kannazuki's instruction again, 'Deep love' Minowa quickly hit the console.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she did that, the Territory placed around the 'Fraxinus' transformed, it condensed into Kannazuki's instructed direction and radius, and an invisible wall was constructed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, right on that spot, the enemy's Maryoku cannon exploded on it. Although an intense light wrapped the monitor projecting the ships outer image but, there was only a small shake in the bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">All of the crew members of 'Fraxinus' had all of their breath taken all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Protect territory, just as its name describes, is a special type of territory which is placed for the goal of avoiding attacks to the interior area. Specifically, the wider the radius of the territory gets the lower the strength becomes but, if it condenses and wraps just barely around the surface of the target then the strength of it increases remarkably.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, just now what Kannazuki instructed was one level ahead. It was a method where a wall-like territory was condensed only towards a specific spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, if that was done then the strength of the Territory would exceedingly increase. The result of it, was right now experienced by all of the crew members.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that is an extremely dangerous double-edge sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a simple reason. If the territory was deployed on a limited radius, then the other parts will turn into a completely defenseless state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"next, on the same direction, designate a Protect territory with the radius 50.69", "Fi,fifty point sixty nine…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please hurry, if not we will die. ‐aah, but it's true that, I always wanted to get the feeling of pain from a near death experience, I don't know what to do</p>
<p class="null-p">anymo…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Protect Territory designated, radius is 50.69!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of Kannazuki's words, the Territory was deployed on the designated spot. Then on the very small set radius Territory, an even more powerful Maryoku cannon was released on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely, it was a power that would damage the ship's body if the previous setting was used. That is why Kannazuki designated the activation into one with a smaller radius, as if he has foreseen that.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more, it was not once or twice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually after the first cannon hit, the number of Maryoku cannons released was 12 times. And all of it was precisely avoided by Kannazuki Kyouhei.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is true that there is only one enemy. The attack direction could roughly be estimated. Following theory, it was probably not impossible. But‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, I somehow managed to grasp the rhythm. In reality I wanted to be tortu… Attacked a little more but, I can't have more damages be placed on commander Itsuka's world tree"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kannazuki suddenly hang out his hands as if to collect everyone's attention, he then glared at the enemy ship shown on the main monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Prepare the convergence Maryoku cannon 'Mystletainn'"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_16.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Why can't it hit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Paddington hit the handrails of the captain seat with his clenched fist together with releasing an angry roar.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though they were shooting the Maryoku cannon multiple times just now, but the 'Ratatoskr' ship was still floating in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more, when this side intercepts them, they won't take an evasive action but rather they were sitting in one spot while accurately defending themselves from the cannon attacks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes‐it was like they were making a fool out of this 'Arbatel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th,the moment the cannon attack reached them, it seems that a Protect territory was deployed on the estimated place of impact!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't joke with me! How could anyone do something like that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bu,but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the crew was about to say anything, the alarm in the bridge rang and echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Heat source confirmed! The enemy ship, is concentrating Maryoku on the main cannon located at the tip of the ships body!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh… Turn right at 1-0-4! Transfer all the generated Maryoku to the Protect Territory!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger. Turning right at 1-0-4"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Paddington's command, the 'Arbatel' moved the direction of its giant body.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, when he thought a glittering light appeared on the tip of the enemy ship, an intense torrent of Maryoku was released out from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It pierced through the Territory of the 'Arbatel' which has its course diverted, and then passed through after scratching the ship's body, it then cut open the clouds before disappearing to the end of the sky. An intense shaking attacked the bridge of the 'Arbatel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it‐Damn it damn it damn ittttttttt!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Paddington shook his throat, he then released the next command.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Turn all of the driving force of the 'Ash Croft-beta' to maximum from number 50! After shrinking the size of the Territory until 3 meters above the surface of the ship, turn left! All speed ahead! scrape of the enemy ship's territory!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ro,roger…!"</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"ahh~ahh~, Origami is having a vacation on the southern island by now. I'm so envious‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a hanger part of the JSDF Tenguu garrison, Mily was tapping on a thin tablet while fanning herself and mumbling in a slow tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Move your hand instead of your mouth"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, while Ryouko was sighing as if she'd given up, she then pulled on the goggle worn on Mily's fore head and quickly let her hand go. *smack* together with that sound, an impact shock ran on Mily's forehead, and she toppled backwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch! Wha, what was that for!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, the next one is this. I am going to be using this later so hurry it up"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she showed one of the Combat Realizer unit she obtained, the laser knuckles 'Nut Crackers'. Coming from the metal covering the fist and the forearm of the glove, a single cable extended towards Mily.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a close-combat specialized equipment which allows the user to perform handto-hand combat by cladding the fist with Maryoku generated by the Realizer but, due to the reach being extremely short, it was a special equipment with not many users even in the team. At the very least, Ryouko is probably the only one that took this as a main equipment on her own accord.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mouu…Ryouko resort to violence every single time-. Please take care of the mechanics head‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While complaining, Mily took the cables in her hand and connected it to the cable; she then touched the screen and commenced tuning the equipment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying. I am the seriously kind type. The captain when I was assigned to the AST was, dangerous enough that remembering back makes it repulsive"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, Ryouko said that while her face turned pale as if she remembered something scary. Mily faced towards her while operating the tablet. "Dangerous…was she that strict?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather than strict, how should I put it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mily asked with a doubtful face, Ryouko continued talking as if she was troubled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see. For example, she would probably hit us for talking useless chatter like right now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah yeah"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, if someone quietly goes near the captain, and *pon*…placed their hands on her shoulders. If that happens then it's an out. On that whole day, you have to wear an embarrassing cosplay shirt chosen by the captain. Of course in the middle of training too, they have to wear it on top of the wiring suits"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eehh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mily raised her eyebrows as much as she could. On that moment her fingers went into disorder and there was number errors popping out. While correcting it in panic, she talked back to Ryouko.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, you mean costume play"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes… and what's more, that was just the beginning. The second out, was a penalty with that person in cosplay state and an add-on of stepping on the captain"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh? They have to step on the captain-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The members that received the penalty have to step on the captain" Mily twitched her cheeks while letting sweat float on her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder…but well, everyone became systematic from being disgusted"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, then, what will happen in the 3rd warning…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…you want to hear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sensing a serious feeling coming from Ryouko's expression who said that, Mily *swing**swing* swung her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th, that captain has quite a personality"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…well, I guess so. There might be a chance if I run through the filter of beautiful Japanese words, probably only a very little amount left has, the possibility of forming that kind of euphemistic expression"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha,haha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards Ryouko who was unusually using a black manner of speaking, Mily unintentionally made a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, "however" Ryouko continued talking with that word.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is true that person is an unthinkable pervert but…his skills are the real thing. Without joking, that person's with the Realizer was a level different from the other members. There is no mistake that person is the AST's ace"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha,haa, is that so… err, then, why is that person not here? If that person was that strong then, the higher ups would have their eyes on that person"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Mily said that, Ryouko raised her eyebrows as if she was bewildered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is…I don't really know. Suddenly one day "I, I have to go find a suitable master who I can serve! Aah, forgive me my comrade's in arm! Don't stop me my companion! So long my sworn friend!" That person said something like that and disappeared. Just in case, that person seems to have left a slight reinstatement wish before taking a register…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously…I wonder what that person is doing"</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Mystletainn', was avoided…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oyah, I missed huh. Hnn, as expected, it would seem I am weak in attacking"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kannazuki said it jokingly, the crew members all together made a powerless wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Enemy ship is coming this way!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, it's coming to scrape off our Realizer directly"</p>
<p class="null-p">A battle between ships equipped with Realizers, if thought carefully, would come to a conclusion of, whether which ship would be the first one to tear off the opponent's territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki *fumu* made a breath before releasing a loud voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Set all of the Basic Realizer to parallel drive. Please transfer all the generated Maryoku to the Territory. At the same time shrink the area. Squeeze it until it is 2 meters after the ship's surface"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger, AR- 008 from machine 1 to 10, parallel drive activate"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, and also for the Control Realizer too, please leave one and have the others to generate Maryoku"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rog‐eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The crew member, who faithfully repeated after Kannazuki, stopped his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was probably a natural reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Fraxinus' is equipped and largely divided into 2 kinds of Realizers. The Basic</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizer with the purpose of generating Maryoku for the use of the cannon and Territory, and the Control Realizer with the purpose of controlling the Basic Territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as the Control Realizer remains as a Realizer, although it is inefficient, it is possible to generate Maryoku like the Basic Territory. It is certain; in order to oppose the approaching enemy ship with large Maryoku output, this kind of method is probably the only way left.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, by abandoning a large portion of the Control Realizer would mean, it would be equivalent to taking the CPU out of a computer. Even if generating large Maryoku output becomes possible, there might be a chance that it would not be even possible to set it to the Territory.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kannazuki groaned thinking that it was normal the crew members would uneasy, he took a black headset from the back of the captain seat, and equipped it on his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's going to be alright. If it's about the replacement for the Control Realizer, it's over here"</p>
<p class="null-p">He said that and pointed his fingers to his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave the explanations to later. If you don't want the 'Fraxinus' to fall then, please follow my instructions"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh‐Roger…! Control Realizer‐machine number 2 to number 8, switching to Maryoku generation!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After the crew members operated the console, in an instant, the Territory that wrapped around the 'Fraxinus' disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">And was immediately restored.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Im,impossible…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Vice-commander, what on earth did you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, the basics are no different from the AST's wiring suits. They use their own brain waves to control the Maryoku generated by the Realizer right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Control…the aircraft's equipped Control Realizer is 7 times from that you know…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave the talking to later. It's coming"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time with Kannazuki saying that, the bridge's alarm rang and echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enemy ship, the Territory output is rising!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun…are you coming to attack? To this 'Arbatel'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Contact with Territory! Please prepare for impact!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The same time with the crew member shouting, the 'Arbatel's bridge was shaking intensely like an earthquake had struck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuuh, activate the Territory radius! Condense it onto the contact surface with the enemy ship! We'll crush them in one go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger! Territory radius activates!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The crew members operated the console. And thus, the Territory deployed on the ship's surface, shrunk towards the enemy ship's direction. The enemy ship has still not shown any signs of movement.</p>
<p class="null-p">I've won‐! Paddington grasp his fist tightly. On the time of contact, judging by the impact, the Territory output is most likely equal. Since this side managed to shrink the area first, the strength of it should grow. If they were to shrink it now, they would not make it. The poor 'Ratatoskr's ship was crushed by the 'Arbatel'‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Paddington opened his eyes wide in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, the sound of explosion echoed from the back of the 'Arbatel'.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought it was a cannon attack from the enemy ship for an instant but, that was an unthinkable cause. That's because, the sound of the explosion happened after the enemy ship crossed to the opposite side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, what on earth happened!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The starboard has slight damages! It is confirmed to be damage from an outer impact!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Outer impact…!? Is it enemy fire!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, I don't know! The cause is unknown!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The crew member raised a shrill voice. And thus, another crew member raised a shout as if he was following the one before him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh! Captain, there's a big problem! From that explosion, block B2 has caught on fire, the control room used for controlling the 'Bandersnatch' team for far distances has been damaged!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you say…!? Hurry and extinguish the fire!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, what was that just now…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the bridge of 'Fraxinus' after the tremor calmed down, Hinako was looking at the enemy ship retreat while mumbling dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though the enemy shrunk the size of their Territory and increased its strength, when they got impatient on Kannazuki for not showing any signs of making any counter-measures, the enemy ship suddenly caught on fire, and distances itself from the 'Fraxinus'.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more, the part where the enemy ship got damaged was totally different from the place it came in contact with 'Fraxinus'. Who on earth could have attacked the enemy ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would seem Hinako was not the only one having that doubt. A big portion of the crew shortens their words, and sent their sights towards Kannazuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kannazuki noticed everyone's stares, he then shrugs his shoulders and hit the small monitor on his arm reach.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if, to tell everyone to look at their hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Obeying that gesture, the crew members looked at their own monitors‐and their eyes stared into wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">On it was the enemy ship making a rotation while caught on fire and‐ they confirmed a small leaf-like silhouette using Invisible mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is‐'Yggd folium' …?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Just now, right before the enemy ship appeared, it was the independent unit that was released to set a relay point for communications with Arubi Island.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone understood at once. And at the same time, was horrified.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the 'Yggd folium', many types of small-scaled Realizers was equipped on it. By using that, they will be able to remote control it from 'Fraxinus', and possibly activate the Territory on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, to be able to deploy the Territory would mean, it could not serve its purpose of only capturing signals.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki controlled that object that was released to make a communication relay from a distance, and used it as a mine.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, even in normal conditions, he was able to compensate for the Control Realizer which created the strain of 7 Realizers while remote controlling something so small, it was offhand unbelievable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably realizing what everyone thoughts are, Kannazuki moved his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, how should I say this. It is quite sad I guess, no matter how advanced the technology one has, right now people could, not create a head for a single human" After saying that, he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, there is no way such humans exist, these thoughts‐were apparently not caught on by him.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…this is‐'Sandalphon'…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his voice while being shocked at the sword that appeared in his right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">A Wide Blade giving off a glowing light. A hand guard with delicate craftsmanship applied on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That is without a doubt, Tohka's "Miracle that holds a shape" ‐Angel 'Sandalphon'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shi,dou…? wh,why can Shidou use 'Sandalphon'…!?" Tohka was also shocked while looking at Shidou's direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was probably normal. That's because 'Sandalphon', which was just shattered by Ellen, had appeared in Shidou's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐while Shidou was surprised, He was somewhat aware of himself to be able to accept the situation calmly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's healing abilities doesn't belong to him in the first place; it was something that appeared after sealing Kotori's Reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Judging by that, the others‐if Shidou's body who has the Maryoku of the spirits sealed inside of it, has become adapted to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then it is possible to think, he is able to use the power of other Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in reality, there is actual proof proving that hypothesis to be correct.</p>
<p class="null-p">due to the Angel manifesting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Angel…? What's more, it's the same as 'Princess's…? That was supposed to be broken by me just now. Before anything else, why is someone like you able to‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen, who was uninterested just now, suddenly changed and looked at Shidou with eyes that reflect inquisitiveness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You call yourself Itsuka‐Shidou right? What on earth are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…human. As far as it goes"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Ellen frown her eyebrows from hearing Shidou's reply, she then hang her hands upwards. Following that movement, the surrounding 'Bandersnatch's lowered their posture as if to show their alertness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've change my mind. Itsuka Shidou. I will have you come with us too. I don't recommend resisting"</p>
<p class="null-p">"guh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gripped onto 'Sandalphon' while making a sullen face.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is true Shidou just now has managed to make two 'Bandersnatch's go into suspension state. Above having the remaining eight 'Bandersnatch's moving in alert mode, there is that unidentified Wizard who has easily beaten Tohka in limit break mode waiting at the far back.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was easy to imagine how difficult it would become in succeeding to run away with Tohka in this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Bandersnatch' team. Please capture him. If there is resistance then I don't mind breaking his arms and legs"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen said that and swung down the hand that was hanging out towards Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, the 'Bandersnatch' that was deployed in the surroundings, attacked Shidou all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, why you…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He suddenly swung 'Sandalphon' he was holding in his hand but, the sword strike he did just now did not come out. The dimly light blade was only drawing traces in the dead night.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, those strikes did not hit the 'Bandersnatch's. Easily dodging Shidou's attack, the 'Bandersnatch's extended its arm towards Shidou's right hand which was holding 'Sandalphon'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, when he thought the sound of a button being pushed sounded, the mechanical dolls surrounding Shidou and Tohka, had sparks bursting out from their heads and their bodies twisted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What on earth, is going on…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He frowned his eyebrows doubtfully. The mechanical dolls that were moving fluently until now were, starting to move awkwardly like an electronic toy that suddenly had its power cut off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at that, Ellen who was staring at the sword being gripped by Shidou's hand, distorted her face inexplicably. And as if she realized something, she placed her hand on her ear and starting moving her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The 'Bandersnatch' team's response is getting disturbed. Did something happen" And then, she shook her throat as if moaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Control Realizer got hit? What do you mean by that… uh, a battle with an aircraft? I don't remember giving any orders like that‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't let this opportunity get away. Shidou immediately kicked the ground and quickly grabbed Tohka's hand before running away from that spot at full speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…what, what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know! But this is a chance!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He said that and as if to get away from the dolls, he ran towards the forest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! We can't let them get away. Please chase them"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time with Ellen letting out her command from behind, a few numbers of the 'Bandersnatch' moved its head towards Shidou to give chase.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐after immediately moving their hands and legs randomly like broken marionettes, they then fell down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…what are you doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen clicked her tongue as if she gotten impatient before, started running to catch Shidou and Tohka herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uguuu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then step on the hole opened up on the ground, and *Suteen*! Fell inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh,why is there a hole in a place like this…!? Don't tell me, this is the high speed hole digging‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally at that moment, one 'Bandersnatch' like it was leaning towards Ellen, fell inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, u, uwaahh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It would seem it was a catastrophic idea to nonchalantly release the CR-unit after bringing Tohka down. Ellen in a state where she has gotten ambushed got buried under the heavy-looking mechanical doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th, this is impossible…I, I am the strongest…wizard‐Mukyuuu" After raising an odd voice, she totally stopped moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, since he doesn't know when Ellen would wake up or when the 'Bandersnatch' functions would recover. Shidou stopped looking back and faced forward, *Gou**gou* he then ran inside the sound of winds.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, wondering how much he advanced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! That is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"muu"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Tohka who were running side by side, shook their throats at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. On the sky above the forest that was having its trees mowed down, they saw Kaguya and Yuzuru clashing at each other repeatedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya‐Yuzuru!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Originally, they had to get away from Ellen as fast as possible but‐Shidou unintentionally stopped his legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he does not stop both of them here and now, mostly likely the battle between both of them would conclude here.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the conclusion would mean‐Kaguya and Yuzuru, either one of them would be annihilated.</p>
<p class="null-p">By any chance if the results were not decided here, it would be the same thing as both of them LOST towards the other world.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to save both of them, Shidou has to seal their Spirit powers, right here and right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both of you! Stop it! There might be a way where both of you can live!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when he shouted, it looks like they did not hear his voice. Although the distance between them was not that far, the wall of wind swirling around both of them probably shut-out any sound coming from the outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, what should I‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said that and suddenly opened his eyes wide, before looking down on his right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right there, he was still holding Tohka's Angel 'Sandalphon'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. If it is the Angel's strike that defeated the 'Bandersnatch' then, it might be possible to slice off the storm wall covering Kaguya and Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, he does not think both of them can be stopped by only that. But, Shidou averted his attention away for an instant; it might be possible to let them hear what I have to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a weak possibility. But, that is the only way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry Tohka, Please get away from me a little bit…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…? U,umu"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka groaned honestly, she separated herself from Shidou's hand and walked a few steps behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou confirmed that from the edge of his view, he made a stance with 'Sandalphon' with both his hands, and slashed down towards the winds covering Kaguya and Yuzuru as if he was trying to cut it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐'Sandalphon' did not release the light like that time it first shown it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He tried multiple times but, the results were the same. 'Sandalphon' was only cutting the air around the radius of its blade,it would not show its absolute authority compared to when Tohka handles it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's no use…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clenched his teeth, and gripped 'Sandalphon's handle harder.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, not yet. Shidou turned his neck and faced towards 'Sandalphon's real master.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka…! I beg you, use 'Sandalphon' and stop those two!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka let out her voice doubtfully. But, probably after looking at Kaguya and Yuzuru who were violently clashing and looking at Shidou's unusual behavior, she guessed the situation and nodded as if she discarded all hindering thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I beg you…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, he pointed 'Sandalphon's grip towards Tohka, and held it out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu, leave it to me"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka nodded once more, she took 'Sandalphon' in her hands. However‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, she made a small breath and brought her eyebrow roots together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"it's no use. The me right now can't swing this 'Sandalphon'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou made question marks float, Tohka stared at Shidou's eye's intensely while continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Sandalphon' is not an ordinary sword. It's an "Angel" manifested by the wish of the user who has Spirit Maryoku. It'll be different if I am in full Reiryoku state but, right now, I can't use 'Sandalphon' which was summoned by Shidou's wish"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way‐then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his face with a desperate feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the sky, the two Spirits were still, continuing mercilessly and going all-out to let the other one live.</p>
<p class="null-p">While praising the opponent each time they open their mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering carefully about the opponent while throwing punches and kicks at the opponent.</p>
<p class="null-p">While conveying their affections with each attack thrown.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hopelessly loving each other, it was the continuation of this distorted fight by these hopeless bunglers.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to kill themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way…like I can allow that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted and grasped 'Sandalphon's handle tightly, and swung once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there was no difference compared to just now. But, there was no other way. Without giving up, he repeated it for the 2nd and 3rd time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it, damn it…! Isn't there a way! If this continues, both of them</p>
<p class="null-p">will…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If Shidou uses the sealed powers, he can seal both of their Reiryoku. If he did that then maybe, both of them don't have to turn into one Yamai and can continue staying in that state.</p>
<p class="null-p">He does not have to step into the middle of the storm. But just on strike. If only he could slice the wind with that one strike, and direct both of their attention towards Shidou‐!</p>
<p class="null-p">And, Tohka placed her hands on Shidou's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…, Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He returned his face to Tohka back from looking up at the sky, and Shidou gulped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka's hand placed on his shoulders was, not something kind as if to comfort Shidou's frustration, but instead it was strong as if she was scolding him harshly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm kind of jealous. To have Shidou say something like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou let out a semi-dumbfounded voice, Tohka made a bitter smile for an instant before nodding with all her strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although I said it just now but, as expected, I think there is no other choice other than everyone talking and understanding each other. If Shidou knows a way to let both of them live, then Kaguya and Yuzuru would probably lower their swords" It was very simple, but it was true.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, what should we‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said it before, the 'Sandalphon' right now, is something summoned from Shidou's wish. If that is the case, if it isn't Shidou who will grant it then who else will"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! Me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Tohka nodded, Shidou grasped the handle tightly. She then brought her body to Shidou's back, and wrapped her hands around Shidou's body as if she was planning to swing 'Sandalphon' together with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">But…as one would expect, their body physique were too different. After "Muu…" groaning, this time she passed under Shidou's arm and came in front.</p>
<p class="null-p">While both of them were in a haori"5E 1"-like state, on Shidou's hand which was gripping onto 'Sandalphon's handle, she gently accompanied her hands together with his.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tohka…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Calm your heart. And remember back. What Shidou wants to do now. What is the thing Shidou wishes for now. Other things now are trivial. Ignore it. Only one, imagine your wish in your heart and swing the sword.‐if you do that, the Angel will definitely answer you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gulped, closed his eyes, and thinly exhaled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Following what Tohka said, he calmed his heart down and arranged his breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">He placed his thoughts away, whether it's the sound of the wind shaking his eardrums, or the storm disturbing his hair, or even the soft and warm feeling from Tohka that is being transmitted to his chest and hands, but only one was imagined in his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru. Whether its coincidence or inevitability, the Spirit that was separated into two.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment they were born, a created existence with the fate of either one of them having to disappear.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even confirming that and yet‐both of them right now, in order to let the other live, they are fighting with their beloved other half.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou grinded his teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like hell, I will, let that happen"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Even when both of them are idiotically kind, something like either one of them having to disappear is just, something that shouldn't be.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, before both of them finish their battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">An absolute and ruthless strike that will crush both of their so called noble battle‐!</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou immediately opened his eyes. 'Sandalphon's blade was emitting a strong light that couldn't even be compared from just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou fixed his grip back, and Tohka was too, added strength to her hand that was accompanying his, she then brought her head forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou once again lifts his head up and captured the bunglers that were making a ruckus unfolding in the sky into his sights.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOhhhhhhhhhhhhhh‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with a shout, swing 'Sandalphon' down aiming at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, light overflowed out of 'Sandalphon'‐as if the sword strike made by the blade was extending, it extended towards the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then 'Sandalphon's light easily sliced through the castle of wind that was blowing violently, and passed between Kaguya and Yuzuru before going into the sky. Splitting the cloud that was swirling into two, the face of the moon that was hiding until now was brought out.</p>
<p class="null-p">When that happened, the wind that was blowing around ceased like it was a lie, and he heard voices filled with confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uneasiness. This is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru who were directing their lance and pendulum at each other, opened their eyes in surprise and probably looking for the source of that sword strike, both of them directed their eyes downwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them recognized Shidou's figure there, both of them raised their eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou…!? That just now, was that you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shock. Impossible. That was a tremendous amount of Reiryoku"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou used 'Sandalphon' like a walking stick, and while he was supported by Tohka, as if to respond to both of their question, he opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya‐Yuzuru…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">One strike. Even it was just one strike, his whole body hurts like crazy. But, if he let this chance go, there might be a chance his voice won't reach anymore. Saying it until his throat felt like it was getting crushed, he raised a loud voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I beg you…stop, fighting!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However when Shidou appealed to them, Kaguya and Yuzuru distorted their face in displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…you, didn't you heard me? Me and Yuzuru, can only exist when one of us absorbs the other"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. That is exactly right. Please do not bother us. Right now Yuzuru has to give a lesson to this blockhead Kaguya, until Kaguya understands she is an excellent Spirit"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, You're still saying that…! I already told you it can't be helped if someone like me doesn't survive!? Why can't you understand! Yuzuru! You should be the one to live!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Deny. Yuzuru doesn't think so. Kaguya should be the one live"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you so…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enraged. Kaguya too‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I!"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he let this momentum go on then, the hardly achieved interruption would go to waste and the battle would start again. He raised his voice as if to interrupt both of their words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't plan to stop being the judge of your battle! I‐will choose! The Spirit suitable for being the true Yamai! The one who should stay alive!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, Kaguya and Yuzuru opened their eyes wide in shock‐the immediately glared at Shidou with piercing stares.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, they didn't try to say anything to him. Tentatively, they plan to hear what he has to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">However it was easy to understand the reason for their fixed stares. Coming from both sides, he felt a pressure strong enough to give him chills on his skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">…the point is, both of them are thinking like this. It will be okay if you choose the opponent. But if you try to choose me, then I will pierce your heart before you finish the name.</p>
<p class="null-p">And since they are the wind spirit 'Berserk'. They probably have the power to make it reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a gulp nervously before opening his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, he placed his choice in his voice and let it out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The one I choose is‐Both of you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou voice echoed throughout the forest that has silence brought out when the wind stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru stared at Shidou for a few seconds before‐both of them, released a big sigh together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…What's up with that. Are you joking with us?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Scorn. It's an answer below elementary school level. A guy with no decisiveness is disgraceful"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying, both of them released a given up voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou wasn't planning on joking around; he wasn't also planning to make fun of them. He seriously, continued his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped! Since both of you have many different good things about you, I can't choose!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">".…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya's cheeks turned red while Yuzuru opened her eyes halfway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Many you say……Don't say it like you know about it! What can someone like you‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know! At the very least, I know something for each one of you faster than both of you did!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Question. And that is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards Yuzuru question, Shidou clutched his fist while squeezing his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For Kaguya, the thought and feelings she has for Yuzuru, is much stronger than Yuzuru towards herself‐while for Yuzuru, she values Kaguya more preciously than Kaguya does to herself"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them kept quiet as if they were at a lost for words. Shidou added more strength to his body which was almost close to collapsing, he mustered up all his strength in his body before continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You two!! You two have the right to select these choices for the future! Choose! ①. Yuzuru absorbs Kaguya and becomes the true Yamai! ②. Kaguya absorbs Yuzuru and becomes the true Yamai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them heeded Shidou's words, what kind of obvious question is that, they made such a face while opening their mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that obvious. ①.‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. There is no need to think. ②.‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou didn't hear the replies and continued talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"③! In exchange for the loss of your Spirit powers, both of you will live…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Shidou said that, Kaguya and Yuzuru opened their eyes in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…? What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Request. Just now, what did you"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou coughed violently. And Tohka turned her head worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he couldn't afford to stop his words here. He moistens his throat with his saliva and squeezes his voice out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry but, I've only been given three choices to choose from for a long time.…I can't allow, to have it only be two choices"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…are you saying? That sort of thing, there is no way it's possible"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doubt. Yes. Yuzuru has not heard of that method before"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru, faced towards him with doubtful eyes. It stands for a reason. The one who says to believe him is the one that is absurd.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Shidou raised a shout.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I beg of you two! Please believe me! Only once is okay! Give me a chance to let you two live…! If it is a failure then, I don't mind if you do whatever you want with me! If that is the case, then you could even kill me! That's why…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…what are you. Aren't you human? That kind of‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just now, did you forget who was the one that sliced your prided wind?", "uh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thought… "</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru lost their words, and looked at each other. Rather than finding the true motives in Shidou words, they were confused in the sudden turn of events.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why‐stop! Both of you don't need to fight with each other anymore…! Something like, one of you having to vanish, no longer‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of his words, Shidou felt an intense drowsiness, and collapsed on that spot. 'Sandalphon' fell on the ground, and turned into light particles before vanishing into the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka let out a worried voice and shook his shoulders. But, it was difficult for him to reply back to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tentatively he has his consciousness but, *Hyuu**Hyuu* he was only releasing air out from his throat and probably can no longer let out his voice anymore. It would seem‐Shidou's body has long crossed its limits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the sky, Kaguya and Yuzuru stared at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya quietly opened her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…that's what he said. What do you think? Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Distrust. It is impossible to think so. Even if that strike was really something from</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, Yuzuru has not heard about stealing the Spirit's Reiryoku away before"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true‐… I think so too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…! …!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside Shidou's blurry view, he somehow tried to squeeze his voice out from his lungs. But‐no matter how much he tried shaking his throat, his breath would not be covered with sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no good. He couldn't manage to make them believe him. Shidou felt his view getting blurry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stop, stop, stop. I really have the power to save both of you. If I stretch out my hand, I can grab them.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou's voice which doesn't sound like a voice didn't reach the sky. Kaguya and Yuzuru were, gazing at each other's eyes while continuing with their words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, Shidou is troubling guy. To disturb us twice"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Seriously. Even though Yuzuru was close to beating Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying? Even I was about to release a one-hit kill"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sneer. Was it the Suturm Lante (Laugh)"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sh,shut up. If you say that one more time, I seriously will get angry"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Challenge accepted. By all means, please do what you like. It's going to be Yuzuru's win anyway. Yuzuru will definitely make Kaguya survive"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't let that happen. I will be the one to win. You have to live no matter what"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rebuttal. Kaguya should"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya made a stance with her lance, while Yuzuru does it with her pendulum. Nearby them, the wind started blowing again.</p>
<p class="null-p">but.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hey, Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. What is it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is persistently just a talk. An if talk. A possibility talk. ‐if by any chance what Shidou said is true then, what do you think"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Petition. Would you give Yuzuru the time limit to think"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Approved. Only 3 seconds"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, the end. So?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply… I think, it's very wonderful"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…fuun. You're unexpectedly quite a romanticist."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Discouraged. Then what about Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…coincidently, me too"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. If both of us live then, what does Kaguya want to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me? Let's see…ah, the thing Tohka said. I might want to try eating that Kinako bread. It seems like its super delicious"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. It does sound delicious"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about Yuzuru?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply.‐Yuzuru would want to try going to school"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…that's nice. Ahaha, if its Yuzuru, then you would definitely be the object of adoration from the guys in the school"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Deny. Yuzuru think that's not possible"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heh? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. That's because Kaguya would be together. Most definitely, Kaguya would be the one getting the popularity"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha,ha…together with me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Affirmative. That's because, since persistently this is just a talk. Yuzuru does not remember a restriction was given"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah…didn't I. I guess so, then when class finishes, let's wander around the town after school"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. That's wonderful. Yuzuru would want to try entering a café"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah Yeah, I get it. But you have to properly split the cost okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Deny. That is unfair. Kaguya eats more than Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I,its not that much of a difference"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Question. Is that so"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the end of those words, both of them were silent for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the sound of wind, the one that restarted the conversation was Kaguya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hey, Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Reply. What is it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I told a lie.…I"</p>
<p class="null-p">Large drops of tears spilled out from Kaguya's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want, to die…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with sobbing, she continued talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to live…I, I want to be with Yuzuru more"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rep‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next thing, on Yuzuru's cheeks, a straight of tears flowed along it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuzuru…too. Yuzuru doesn't want to disappear. Yuzuru wants to live with Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuzuru…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them mixed their sights, and moved their lips at the same time. "‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the voice that came out from their throat, did not reach to one another.</p>
<p class="null-p">More importantly, a giant sound of a motor from far away, roared further above the sky from Kaguya and Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gazing. That's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru looked upwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there was, a floating giant black warship with smoke coming out from its rear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Captain! It will be dangerous if we lower the altitude any further than this! In the state where Invisible isn't used, there might be a chance the residents will notice‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside 'Arbatel's bridge, the screams of the crew member's dyed in uneasiness, echoed throughout.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Silence!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Paddington, who was sitting on the captain seat, silenced them in one roar.</p>
<p class="null-p">The residents will notice? What meaning does that have? In reality, when the 'Arbatel' started nose diving, 'Ratatoskr's airship stopped pursuing us.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fortunately, it would seem the Captain on the order side has the same mediocre thoughts as the crew members on this side. Due to them being secretive as their foremost thoughts, they allowed their wounded enemies to escape under their nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No‐that's wrong huh" Paddington licked his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">If they had the goal of keeping their own ship a secret then, they could use the method of attacking the 'Arbatel' even if they don't give chase. They could use the convergence Maryoku cannon to shoot, or use that mysterious mine they used just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, by any chance the events of them proceeded on attacking, there might be a possibility they would brought forth casualties on the island.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was that captain that belongs to a capricious organization that tries to persuade the Spirit using peaceful means then, he thought that might be the case but…it would seems he had hit the mark.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐that was not enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Losing few units of the 'Bandersnatch', damaging the 'Arbatel', and running back. At that point, Paddington's disgrace would be final.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to cancel all that, he needs a better outcome to compensate for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Paddington glared at the two girls being shown on the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just now, just before the communication was cut off, according to the information given by Ellen, that is Spirit 'Berserk'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fire is extinguished in the Control room right! Make all the remaining 'Bandersnatch's in the ship takeoff! We have to capture 'Berserk' and 'Princess' no matter what!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bu,but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just do it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to Paddington's shout, the crew skipped a beat and hit the console while grinding his teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Yuzuru wish it could read the mood"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru looked at the giant cluster of metal up in the sky while, letting out unhappy voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was the reconciliation with their beloved other half, that thing disturbed them with perfect timing.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it did not end at there.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they thought the hatch installed at the rear of the warship opened, coming out from there separately, dolls packed with various weapons on its back and limbs fell out from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Organic and having a smooth form. Tentatively, they were dolls with head's and limbs but, rather than it being human, demi-humans or devils from story books come into mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">What's more, those mechanical dolls, after opening the wiring at its back mid-air, the unexpectedly circled around the sky easily and started flying around as if they were trying to surround Kaguya and Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, in the next moment, the doll that was flying around the surroundings, pointed their right hand equipped with a tube-like object at both of them and beams was released from them. "Uoou!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kaguya and Yuzuru dodged those just when they was about to hit, *Kiii* they glared at the dolls.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the other dolls immediately made a stance with its cannon as if to follow that, and commenced attacking Kaguya and Yuzuru.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, what's with these dolls"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kaguya made the tip of the lance she was holding in her right hand spin, it created a small scale typhoon and mowed down the dolls that were grouping there. "Offensive. It's irritating"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuzuru also controlled the pendulum on her left hand, and blew away the dolls that were around their surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the dolls that were scattered about from both of their attacks, fixed back their posture as if nothing happened and once again faced towards both of them while ignoring gravity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru distorted their eyebrows unpleasantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu…what a disgusting bunch"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Honestly, Yuzuru doesn't want to be touched by that"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kaguya and Yuzuru blew the dolls away again, they once again gaze at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would seems the dolls have not stop coming down. The dolls were still individually, being dropped down from the giant ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them got fed up and bent their shoulders from looking at that, they opened their mouth at the exact same time. If this was the case then, it would never end no matter how many dolls they defeat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Yuzuru"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Suggestion. Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their voices perfectly overlapped. After Kaguya and Yuzuru suddenly opened their eyes in shock, they looked at each other's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, coming from both sides, "Fufu" such a voice leaked out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wanna do it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Let's do it"</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them made a small nod, Kaguya held out her left hand, while Yuzuru does it with her right hand‐they perfectly, joined them together.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they did that, both of their AstralDress and Angel shined in brightly and‐the wing growing out of Kaguya's right shoulder and the wing growing out of Yuzuru left shoulder joined together, and formed a bow-like shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, Yuzuru's pendulum became the bowstring and connected the wings together from one side to another‐Kaguya's Lance became the arrow and was nocked on the bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, Kaguya using her right hand, while Yuzuru using her left.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the hands wrapped in the AstralDress armor, their left and right hand pulled the bowstring at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bow that had been pulled to its limit was then pointed towards the warship up in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Raphael'‐'Ell Kanaph'!!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_17.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Both of them, released their hands at the exact same time, and that giant arrow was shot high up to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, a wind pressure that could not even be compared with before attacked nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Tohka who were right underneath them were still okay but, the dolls that were flying around them got blown away just by the aftermath. The remaining trees were mowed down and the forest rustled about like it is waving.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is nothing in existence that can stop the advancement of the arrow covered in the winds protection.</p>
<p class="null-p">An absolute and invincible single concentrated attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">A shot that was first done by both the Yamai's joining forces, the strongest arrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards the warship that is a product of humans, there should be no reason, for it to be able to dodge it.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a span of an instant, the giant warship got pierced by 'Raphael's arrow, and due to it being wrapped in wind pressure, the interiors were messed up and destroyed‐the night sky dyed red together with the sound of a giant explosion.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 6</p>
<p class="null-p">"…kuh, ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with a groan-like voice, Origami slightly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The view that is being projected now was not the sky of the island being blown by wind, but rather it was the ceiling of a hotel room being illuminated by a square lighting. For an instant, she thought she was attacked by a hallucination as if what happened all this time was just a dream but‐wrong. It was certain that a dull pain was left on her side.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she made a wry face while touching her chest, she found out medical treatment was done with bandages and fomentation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What on earth happened…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, you woke up"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, coming from the side of the pillow, she heard a sleepy voice. It was the vicehomeroom teacher Murasame Reine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensei…where am I"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it's my room. I'm sorry but, I will have you moved here. Since it will probably cause a commotion if the other students see this"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err…the dolls‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, after you lost consciousness, for some reason it suddenly stopped moving"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami said that shortly, she somehow managed to raise her creaking body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it's better not to force yourself. Stay quiet for today"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was the treatment done by sensei?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah. Sorry I used what was available"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No… thank you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…the one who should say thanks is me. Thanks to you I was saved. Thank you"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Reine lowered her head. Origami drank down her saliva before continuing talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sensei, about that doll"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I didn't tell anyone. Is it better that way?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami looked back at Reine silently.</p>
<p class="null-p">…She felt that this teacher Murasame, is oddly calm even though she was suddenly attacked. And above that, she performed medical treatment on Origami with calm judgment and did not talk to anyone about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's true, for Origami she does not want the information about mysterious doll be recklessly spread but…how to put it, she felt it was a little too perfect.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes‐it was like, she knows about the existence of the CR-unit.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami stopped those thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's because a more important matter appeared in her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…hnn?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where's Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…aah, he's okay. It looks like he's heading this way"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those words, Origami made a sigh of ease‐she twitched her shoulders with a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How, do you know that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami said that, Reine scratched her cheeks and made her eyes wander around as if "Oh no" she made a mistake. And after a moment of silence, she opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…intuition?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was silently crawled out of the futon. Even if she was guaranteed of Shidou's safety with that weak reason, there is no way she could not be worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the moment she stood up from that spot, a dull pain rain across her stomach, and made Origami fall on her knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…that's why I said it before. You shouldn't force yourself. What, he'll be back soon"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…kuh"</p>
<p class="null-p">While being on all fours, Origami punched the floor with her fist. Although a light pain rain at her stomach from that impact but, she didn't register it and punched the floor once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just an attack. Just from an attack with no weapon. From a doll that was not a Spirit or anything's attack, and this.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Origami now, who had her Realizer stolen from her, was sorrowfully just a normal human.</p>
<p class="null-p">So weak, and so powerless. She was just coincidently hanging onto the life she picked up. If the doll did not stop its function on that spot, then she might have been killed together with Reine. She was a weak girl that could not bring back Shidou‐her lover from that dangerous place. That right now is Tobiichi Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">She clenched her teeth. She could lightly taste blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"ger"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…un?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reine tilted her head. But it was not a word for Reine to hear. As if to say it to herself, she chant that once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want…to be stronger. Not relying on anything, enough…to protect</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether she heard those words or didn't hear it‐Reine, quietly cast her eyes down and gently put her coat on Origami's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 7</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Arbatel'. This is Adeptus 1. Please respond, 'Arbatel'"</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow managing to get her consciousness back, Ellen who has crawled out from under the 'Bandersnatch' shouted but, she could only hear noise coming from the other side of the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen clicked her tongue inside her mouth, and distorted her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Arbatel' is probably 8 out of 9 defeated. Just now, there was no mistake all of the 'Bandersnatch' have stopped functioning all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">She encircled herself with thoughts. It was still okay if the 'Arbatel' was completely destroyed leaving nothing at all, and everyone including Paddington died. But, she can't let that ship be handed over to 'Ratatoskr' at all cost‐</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Ellen shook her shoulders lightly. It was because she heard some kind of sound coming from the Incam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this the 'Arbatel'? How's the situation‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the communication partner she predicted was someone different. A giggle she heard before was shaking Ellen's eardrum.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu…Judging by that state, it looks like the plan failed. Isn't this quite rare for someone like you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ike"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That voice belonged to none other than Isaac Westcott.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm very sorry. Everything is my responsibility"</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, her mind did not think that way. It was the fault of that incompetent fool who went overboard with the powerful toy he was given and‐the devilish female school students.</p>
<p class="null-p">Westcott made a laugh once more as if he looked through Ellen's thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, how about 'Princess'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry. I failed in capturing her"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was she a Spirit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ye,Yes. I have confirmed that. There is no mistake. Yatogami Tohka is the Spirit 'Princess'"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Ellen said that, Westcott rang his throat as if he was satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, what, looks like you properly identified her. Just knowing that gives the plan this time a significant meaning. ‐Good job. Return back to base"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dissatisfied?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No such thing. Only‐lastly, there is one question I want to ask"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Houu, What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen quietly opened her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something like a human able to control the Spirit's power, do you think it exists?"</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 8</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was borrowing Tohka's shoulder while, sluggishly walking towards the hotel.</p>
<p class="null-p">The forest fell completely into ruins compared to its original self; it became very visible compared to the time he came here, and it was also much easier to walk. He gazed ahead at the dim road while, murmuring worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…this, has gotta be okay right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou said that, he felt that…he heard the sound of Kaguya and Yuzuru gulping.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when they approached near the hotel, Shidou and the group found something strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…? That's…done by the…'Bandersnatch' right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to Kaguya's and Yuzuru's wind, it would seem that it was blown over here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Its head had a caved-in like damage. It was probably knocked in when it was falling.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, when Shidou was encircling himself with thoughts, he heard Kaguya made a chuckle from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…it's because of our intense hurricane. A doll like this would only be played around like garbage"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Yuzuru and Kaguya's wind is the strongest"</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them said that, they bumped their fist and smile at each other. It was a unthinkable reconciliation between these two judging from what had happed before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"More importantly‐ly. Shidou, hurry up and seal our powers"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Although there is still time but, the faster the better"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, no, that's"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou looked towards Tohka direction, his words turned unclear. Tohka, looked back at him unhappily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Si,since I have to make plenty of preparations. So we'll do it quickly tomorrow's morning, please wait a little longer"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, he can't do it in front of Tohka. Shidou made a random excuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuun…it better not be a lie? If you send forth a lie towards this child of the typhoon then, think of it that your bone would not even be left"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lyching. Until Shidou's full of dents"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I,I didn't make up a lie"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them looked at Shidou with suspicious eyes, they made a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…well that's okay I guess. I'll believe you. By the way Tohka"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu? What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Request. For a little while, could Tohka lend us Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to finish Kaguya's word, Yuzuru said that. Tohka unpleasantly tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind but…why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It, it's okay, just a little while, you wait here"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kaguya said that, Tohka took her hand away from Shidou's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">And just like that she let both of them carry Shidou, before entering the side of the forest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha,what is it seriously"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay so keep quiet"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agree. Silence is golden"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told by them authoritatively, Shidou quietly shut his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, when they reach a spot where they couldn't see Tohka, both of them stopped their legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Shidou. Well, how'd I put this, thank you. In many ways"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks. Thanks to Shidou, Yuzuru and Kaguya's fighting ended"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was taken back, from the sudden gentleness. Shidou made a wry smile as if he was troubled.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, after Kaguya and Yuzuru made an eye signal to each other, they returned their sights back at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, well, it's something boring but, we thought of giving you a gift"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Petition. Please close your eyes"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Eyes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows while, quietly obeying their orders.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he did that‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Coming from left and right.</p>
<p class="null-p">His lip's right and left, a soft feeling was produced at the same time and Shidou turned surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Kaguya and Yuzuru were, giving Shidou a kiss at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, you two, what are you‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tha,that's why I said it before. It's an exchange gift. It's the first kiss of two super beauties, Yuzuru and me you know? You dancing in joy is still okay but, that reaction is still nice"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apology. Was it a bother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya folded her arms while her face was red, and Yuzuru hangs her head down apologetically. And‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Surprise. This is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya and Yuzuru let out a voice filled with panic out from her throat. But that is only normal. That's because, both of their straightjackets and chains that were covering their body turned into light particles and disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, ukyaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Panic. Ecchi-desu"5E 2"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them together covered their chest, and squat down on that spot. Shidou return a follow in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cal, calm down both of you! Actually, in order to seal the Reiryoku, that was an important‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou? There was something glowing but, what happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!? Tohka!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And making the situation worse, Tohka who was supposed to be waiting behind, *hyokon*, brought her face out.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, after suddenly opening her eyes in shock, she probably understood the situation and Tohka's face turned beet red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shi, Shidou!? Wha, whawhawhat were you doing!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N,no, you're wrong! I didn't‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou suddenly stripped off my clothes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shedding tears. Yuzuru can't become a bride anymore"</p>
<p class="null-p">Coming from his back, becoming the final blow, Kaguya and Yuzuru's cover fire entered. After Tohka's cheeks turned even redder, she glared at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidoooouuuuu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai, wait! Rig,right now my body is…uh, a,aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's bitter shout echoed throughout the forest night.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue: Shidou, I‐</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">The night with a storm blowing turned dawn, and it became the next day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and the group had departed from the hotel were looking at the mowed-down trees from the bus' window while moving towards the airport in order to go back to Tenguu city.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the students listened to some important reminders and Checked-In their luggage, The students were told to stand-by at the lobby while waiting for their airplane to take off. Although they should have bought enough stuff already, they either went scavenging in the sale spaces or were smacking their lips in the Airport's food court gourmet.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected from high school students. They were high school student in the midst of their youth. Even though they were completely playing around the beach yesterday, it would seem they still have stamina left.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou sitting on the lobby's chair completely exhausted while, haha…making a powerless smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Iyaaah, everything ended in a flash"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, right beside Shidou, Tonomachi who for some reason had a sunburn only from his neck to his head said that while cheerfully smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"aah…yeah I guess"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied back like a completely withered old tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last night, after manifesting 'Sandalphon', his body was attacked by a strong feeling of despondency but‐after sleeping for one night, an intense muscle ache was added on top of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, if this is the price to pay for swinging the "Angel"'s power which is excessive for the human body, and, if this is the price to pay for saving both Kaguya and Yuzuru then, it might be something cheap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I say this, I didn't get much of that school trip feeling…"</p>
<p class="null-p">He said that and made a sigh. In the end, because he was dragged into various troubles, he didn't join much of the group activities.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh Ahh, what's with you, making such a tired face. You weren't in the room last night right? Where did you go, ah? Until you are this tired, who and what type of perverted acts did you do with?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tonomachi asked while *Fuun**fuun* his breathing turns wild. Shidou sighed as if he given up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are perverted things assumed…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well that's, when a healthy high school male disappears in the night of a school trip and said nothing happened, people that would believe that would either be a saint, idiot or Tohka-chan right. So? Who is it? Tohka-chan…I guess no. Since she was filled with energy. Is it that? Did your soul get exhausted after being the Yamai sister's partner both of them in one go? Perfect, I can't see them"</p>
<p class="null-p">"aah…well, in a way"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou made a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. It's true, starting from the time they came out from the hotel, Kaguya and Yuzuru figures were not there.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that incident, both of them were transported to the 'Ratatoskr'. Most likely the next time they will meet will be after all the examinations are complete, and when he goes back to Tenguu city.</p>
<p class="null-p">Conveniently, both of them were treated as transfer students but…it was still unsure whether they will be continuing attendance at Shidou's school after this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he says that, the reconciled twin's mental state is by far the most stable compared to the Spirit's until now, the day where both of them lined together walking in town, probably wouldn't be far.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was thinking things like that, Tonomachi moved his face closer without hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oi, what is with that unclear excuse. Or is it that? As I thought, is it Tobiichi whose</p>
<p class="null-p">figure can't be seen now? What kind of intense hard play did you do", "Origami…huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his cheeks while answering.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami figure was also not seen from the time they came out of the hotel this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">From what he heard from Reine, after waiting for the storm to stop, she was transported to a nearby hospital and might be late returning back to Tenguu city.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would seem she has received an attack from the 'Bandersnatch' but…I wonder if she is okay.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, during the time Tonomachi was trying to question him more, he heard Tamachan sensei's voice coming from far away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaai~! Everyone, it's almost time, please gather up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh…it's already that time"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuh, Oi Itsuka, I will properly hear what you have to say later!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tonomachi said that with an exaggerated gesture. Somehow, he reminds Shidou of a villain that was always beaten weekly shouting "Remember this!".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, after Shidou managed to stand up by inserting some energy inside his staggering leg, and as if to match up with that, *step**step* he heard such footsteps.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou! I bought a lot of snacks!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka said that, and was holding a bag from the souvenir shop with both hands, while running towards him smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was part of the huge fight from yesterday, she was 100 times as energetic and was in full power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a sec; don't you think you bought too much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no such thing! Look, it's a limited flavoured Chupa Chups. Kotori will be happy too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she made a smile with no worries and was happy to the bottom of her heart, he couldn't say anything anymore. After Shidou *pon**pon* patted his head, he slowly walked over to the assembly spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hai Hai, has everyone gathered? Well then, we will be boarding the airplane now so, please line up in order"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan sensei was overlooking the students that were assembled at the lobby while echoing her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">The students were noisy because they were reluctant for the school trip to end while, lining up to the seat arrangements that were made beforehand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, is it okay if I sit beside the window going back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, Tohka said that while making her eyes glitter. She was probably still regretting letting Origami take the airplane's window side seat when they were coming.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it seems Origami is in the hospital now, so he doesn't mind if it's that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"aah, I don't‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will not accept that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"heh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Towards the voice that echoed as if to block Shidou's words, he released a disarrayed voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he looked behind, over there was Origami using crutches while having bandages wrapped around her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O,Origami!? Why are you here!? Forget that, is your injury…okay!?", "No problem"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Origami said that calmly, she snuggled up to Shidou's side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Wh,why you, get away! What's with you suddenly appearing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The seat should have already been decided. The window seat is mine. You can enjoy looking at the pathway"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No fair! Going back, I will sit the window seat! I will be seeing the scenery together with Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka and Origami sandwiched Shidou and started fighting. Each time, Shidou's body which was being tortured by muscle aches, was being shaken about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai, wait a second…! Calm down both of you! Use a more peaceful…I know, how about deciding it using rock-paper-scissors?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu…that one that decides the winner with three different hand shapes huh. I don't mind but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Shidou says it then I have no objection"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Origami quietly replied, Tohka's sights became sharp and she griped her right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. Let's end this. Jyaan ken pon"5F 1"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time with their voice, Tohka and Origami brought their hands forward at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">but, at that moment Shidou felt something out of place.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was very simple. The hands that were brought out on that spot, had two extras.</p>
<p class="null-p">"eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka went guh. Origami also went guh. And, the hands that were coming out from their sides, both of were showing paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">rock scissors</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…although the black magic stonePaper and the heaven splitting twin swords is out rivaled but, it losses to the amulet of crushing evil"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Declaration. It's Yuzuru and Kaguya's win. Yuzuru and Kaguya will be having both seats beside Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kaguya‐Yuzuru!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked at the owners of paper who released their voices, and released a shocked voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Over there was, Kaguya and Yuzuru who was supposed to be under 'Fraxinus' custody from yesterday night.</p>
<p class="null-p">And behind them was, Reine with her head wobbling around. After he looked over to her as if to ask a question; she slowly walked over to him and started talking in a low tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it's because they told me, they really wanted to ride the plane with Shidou. Their condition seems to be stable, and since it's not a good thing to recklessly give them stress, a special permit was given. The regular examinations will be done when we go back to Tenguu city"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no, I don't mind about that…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the winners who are Kaguya and Yuzuru, linked their arms with both of Shidou's arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…Shidou think of this as an honor. At first we think of you as nothing but an offering to our duel but‐we unexpectedly took a liking to you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Affection. Yuzuru too. However, Yuzuru does not want to fight with the reconciled Kaguya"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, at that point. Shidou, it is decided you will be me and Yuzuru's shared property", "Agree. So that's the case. We will give you love appropriately"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha…haah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou unbearably shouted, Tohka and Origami frowned their eyebrows and glared at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, what does this mean? As expected, did something happened when both of them got naked?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naked? What's with that. I request an explanation"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Shidou was having trouble with answering, Kaguya and Yuzuru who was securing both his sides, *fufun* made a sound with their nose. "Kuku…sorry about this Tohka. But if you are my clansman then be very proud of yourself. That's because, you were able to give an offering to me"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Discipline. Master Origami. Thank you for everything. Yuzuru will protect master's teaching and move on"</p>
<p class="null-p">After both of them said that, Tohka and Origami respectively took both of Shidou's legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't screw with me! I won't hand over Shidou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't suddenly appear and say things as you please"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku…nice bravery! To challenge us the Yamai sisters!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Challenge accepted. Yuzuru and Kaguya will take both of you on. Take a good look at Yuzuru and Kaguya's combination"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, four of them from four sides, started pulling each of Shidou's limbs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai…wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After using 'Sandalphon' and becoming all worn out, Shidou's body finally raised a scream from the final attack he received.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of her heart beating was awfully loud.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori made a small wry smile while making shoe noises in the wide corridor. Although Kotori was the only one in this wide space but‐as expected, she was probably a little nervous. Even though she came to such a place many times already, but it seems she can't get quite use to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori was in her usual crimson military uniform but, she did not place the jacket on her shoulders and was properly wearing it in the sleeves with the shirt buttoned into place. Naturally, she was not eating any candy in her mouth. If the 'Fraxinus' crew sees this, they would probably have opened their eyes in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori stopped her legs in front of the door, *suu* she took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then *knock**knock*, she knocked on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuka Kotori, has arrived"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐enter"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori replied shortly, she opened the door and entered the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">The inside of the room looked like a library. The four sides of the room were covered with bookshelves and have leather covered books stored on it. She does not know the full details of it. That was only normal, since the books that were opened on the desk didn't only have letters written on it but rather in exchange, it had Braille lined up in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in the deepest part of the room, that man was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's been a long time, Commander Itsuka"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, he turned his chair around and turned his face towards Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">He has an almost white beard and hair, and sweet-looking eyes. His age should be around 50 years and above. His age alone was somewhat not enough to call him an old man but, he feels like a good-natured old man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rounds chairman, Elliot Woodman.</p>
<p class="null-p">He is 'Ratatoskr Machinery's founder and Kotori's benefactor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It has been a long time, sir Woodman"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori gathered her heels together and made a beautiful bow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like you have been quite amazing lately. The others from the round table were shocked"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because being shocked is part of their job"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kotori said that, Woodman made a laugh pleasantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, don't say that. They are they, and are capable people needed for</p>
<p class="null-p">'Ratatoskr'…More importantly, Commander Itsuka. I heard you used</p>
<p class="null-p">'Camael', have you been taken care of yourself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Sorry to have made you worry"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. I think I should be the one apologizing to make you do something that reckless"</p>
<p class="null-p">After he said that, he stroked his beard while continuing to talk in a quiet tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…by the way, I received a report just now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Report?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. It would appears 'Fraxinus' has been attacked by an airship which is thought to belongs to DEM Company"</p>
<p class="null-p">She has already received that report. "Yes" she tilted her head to the front.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard. But, Kannazuki is in the ship. So there shouldn't be a problem"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess you're right… putting it in another way, the problem is the other one"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, what do you mean"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kotori asked, Woodman showed slight hesitation before saying it out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…it would seems, your brother has manifested an Angel"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those words, Kotori twitched her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">She drank down her saliva, and placed her hands on her chest as if to suppress the heartbeat that had turned wild, she rearranged her breathing before replying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, see. ‐Already"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh. Most likely, sealing your Reiryoku again was the trigger"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…uh"</p>
<p class="null-p">She unintentionally clenched her teeth. Probably noticing Kotori's state, Woodman distorted his face apologetically.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…if anything happens, we might be urged to deal with it appropriately. If not, the Spirits that have their Reiryoku sealed away would, again bring forth disaster"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Acknowledged…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Kotori quietly closed her eyes partly, Woodman released his voice as if he was groaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'm sorry to have pushed such a detestable role to you"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, there is no choice…from now on, if the worst case happened"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_18.jpg">
<p class="null-p">And then, Kotori made a small nod before releasing her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will kill Shidou"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_05_19.jpg">
<p class="null-h1">Afterwords</p>
<p class="null-p">Long time no see, its Tachibana Koushi here. I present to you "Date A Live 5 Yamai Tempest".</p>
<p class="null-p">The Spirit this time is the first time two appeared at once, the twin sisters (?) Kaguya and Yuzuru. How was it? I would be happy if you enjoyed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, even though it's a volume with two Spirits appearing, I somehow oddly feel that the amount of other new characters this time is a lot. Well since this is a volume that has started its motion behind the scenes, if I say there was no choice then there was no choice but…how do I put it, I seriously had a lot of assistance from Tsunako-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, the character that took my liking other than the Spirit would be Ellen. At first I was planning to make her an extra but, somewhere along the way she became a nice character. I love characters that are fun to mess with.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, here's an attention. I think there are many who noticed this but, this time; the book is different from normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Turn one page back please. Open your eyes right before the afterword, the picture design on 'Fraxinus' is on it! The designer was Ebi Kawakanetake. Thank you for the amazing design! It's super cool. Everyone please take a look!</p>
<p class="null-p">Since there is a lot of notice this time compared to before, let's do this in one go.</p>
<p class="null-p">The serialized book comic version of "Date A Live" from Ringo-san by the monthly series of Shounen Ace, has finally been decided to be sold on 25/8!</p>
<p class="null-p">And the serialized spin off comic monthly series "Date A Strike" from Dragon age by Oniyazu kakashi-san has also been confirmed to be sold on 8/9!</p>
<p class="null-p">Iyaaah, this is amazing. It's a 3-strand rush with this book included. It's like the Jet S**eam attack. By position I would be the one to be a stepping-stone. Gukyaaaa.</p>
<p class="null-p">And what's more, this doesn't end at there. The original book "Date A Live 5 Yamai Tempest", the comic version "Date A Live" and "Date A Strike" will be a memorable consecutive release, it seems there is no choice but to open an multi purchase campaign!</p>
<p class="null-p">I think further details will be written on the wrap so please check!</p>
<p class="null-p">And! On December the scheduled "Date A Live 6 Miku Lily", the deadline 31/8 to book the limited edition is approaching! I was shown the sample picture but, it's the results were quite good. Those who are interested, please hurry!</p>
<p class="null-p">Now then, this will be the last; this time too, thanks to the efforts Tsunako-san, supervisor-san, Designer-san and also everyone that is related to the publication, the book was able to be presented to everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once again, thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next time "Date A Live 6 Miku Lily"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of lily, it would be the Yuri flower. That would mean well…it will become like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well then, I hope we meet again in the next volume.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Tachibana Koushi</p>
