<p class="null-h1">Chapter 0: Murasame Reine</p>
<p class="null-p">If the sky had eyes, what would it see?</p>
<p class="null-p">If the sea had arms, what would it embrace?</p>
<p class="null-p">If the Earth had a heart, what would it feel?</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Of course, this is just a metaphor, an assumption.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky does not see anything, the sea does not embrace anything, and the Earth does not feel anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nature has no will of its own and the world holds no such thoughts. Someone who can mentally sense all things in creation does so through their own viewpoint of the world. To worship nature as God, to fear calamities as a monster, that is trying to comprehend an extraordinary existence with narrowed minded self-knowledge.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world merely just exists. There is no will that would intervene.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if. If a life is created from the mana that is ubiquitous in nature, there will be a will born.</p>
<p class="null-p">And if that life accepted its end and dissolved into the world once again‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">How would this exert an influence on this world?</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐As if lamenting, the skies chanted</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐As if bursting open, the seas cried out</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐As if trembling, the Earth roared.</p>
<p class="null-p">The life that melted into the world began to faintly pulsate again.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1: Tobiichi Origami</p>
<p class="null-p">The first time I encountered Shidou, it could be described as quite early compared to everyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps with the exception of Mio and Kotori, it would be the first. In any case six years ago, the meeting already occurred around elementary school age.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well to be more precise, the Shidou of that time was a Shidou who had traveled back to the past from the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm not particularly saying that the length of time spent is proportional to strength of one's feelings. On the contrary, there are limits to being rewarded for intense feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is salvation and also a curse. If this was completely proportionally, if love came at a first-come first served basis, I surely couldn't compare to Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, reality was by no means like this. I also can't boast of having the most long-connection with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone who appeared after me, someone who hasn't been seen yet, or perhaps‐‐someone who now no longer exists, there's always the possibility of anyone wining his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐‐‐‐‐Shidou. Who is reflected in your eyes now?</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky was clear, the winds were calm. Today's forecast called for clear weather.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if drawn in a picture, it was the perfect day for laundry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Itsuka Shidou rolled up his sleeves delighted, in high spirits as the dehydrated laundry was packed into a basket and he entered the garden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm‐‐the weather is lovely."</p>
<p class="null-p">Smiling with narrowed eyes, he hung the house clothes on the clothesline rod with his own hands to dry. Of course, he stretched out the wrinkles so they wouldn't leave marks when drying.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Itsuka residence's washing machine also had a drying function. But when the weather was nice like today, he wanted to expose the laundry to as much sunlight as possible. It may be less efficient, but there was a feeling of irresistible warmth to have it dry evenly outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of the few obsessions in Shidou's life, it was a hobby that wasn't a hobby. It was similar to a coffee connoisseur grinding beans or a music lover examining speakers. An onlooker would see no great difference, but for the person in question the difference was wide. It would be troubling to ask why. Humans have long since been creatures that have pointlessly cared about and loved matters like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, this should do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking a small breath, he gently wiped away the sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">The unstained laundry neatly lined up under the brilliant morning sunlight. His lungs gained a sufficient sense of exhilaration and satisfaction. Shidou smiled in accomplishment as he stretched.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if to match that timing, someone from the streets called out to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Good morning, Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking over there, he found four girls dressed in the same uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">A white sailor suit decorated with a checkered blue collar and tie. It was a uniform indicating a junior high student in this city.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of the four had greeted Shidou‐‐a gentle girl with a rabbit doll on her left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her name was Yoshino, one of the former Spirits girls living in the mansion soaring next to the Itsuka residence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, good morning, Yoshino. Everyone is here really early today."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou replied while taking a step towards them, a girl with her hair tied in Odangos‐‐Mukuro nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. There's only a few more days of schooling remaining. Muku wants to make as many memories as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I don't care, but it can't be helped since everyone is going……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Muttering a supplement to Mukuro's words, it was another girl living in the same mansion, Natsumi. While making a grumpy face, she fidgeted with the tips of her hair with her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to this, a girl, who was holding a bamboo sword together with her school bag, shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's real little sister‐‐Takamiya Mana. A tear-shaped mole underneath her left eye and her hair was tied in a ponytail. Although she was wearing the same sailor suit as everyone else, her stance had a more grand awe-inspiring authority than being just cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so you hate it huh. Who was the first person that got up and was waiting for Mana and the others? After being invited by Kanon-san, someone has been preparing for it since yesterday‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi hurriedly raised her head, reaching out to stop Mana's remarks.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Natsumi, who suffered from chronic exercise deficiency, couldn't catch up to Mana who excelled in kendo.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the silhouette of those two intertwined for just a moment, Natsumi was soon panting and out of breath. Looking at the situation between those two, Yoshino and Mukuro couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at this, Shidou also couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Time flew by so quickly. It has already been a year since they started junior high school.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because they transferred in as third year student, it wouldn't be long until graduation. But it seems that everyone had founded what they wanted in school life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Oh everyone. Sorry, sorry, did I keep you all waiting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, there was a voice coming from the entrance. What followed afterwards were the smooth sounds of footsteps.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wearing the same uniform as everyone else, it was Shidou's little sister Kotori. Running towards everyone, her twintails were swaying back as they were tied by a white ribbon. After noticing Kotori's voice, the girls all turned to face her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Kotori-san. Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need to mind. Muku and the others have also just arrived."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Yeah, Natsumi was in high spirits yesterday, so I guessed it would have been earlier than usual."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's face flushed a deep red color. However, after exhausting all of her strength chasing after Mana, she could only cough repeatedly this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't anything shameful. It's good to have fun at school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……After all, just a year ago, someone clearly said school is hell wrapped in an oblaat, a containment facility, and villains there need no tombstones, so it's not too unreasonable to turn hostile when trying not to admit to a fault now."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Shidou say that, Natsumi looked away. Saying something so terrible……there was definitely the feeling of that being there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. People grow up. Isn't it natural to change your mind after a year?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Mu, muu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi mumbled to herself while trying to cover up her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Mana vigorously patted her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, Kotori-san is also here, so let's head out. The moments of youth are painfully short"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch……! I-I know……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi staggered a few steps as if to express "……I'm heading out" while glancing back at Shidou waving good-bye. Everyone else also waved in return.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm heading out now Onii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're leaving now Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun, see you later Nushi-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, be careful on the way there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou waved his hand as he watched those girls walk out on the street. After that, Shidou stretched out again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's still some time before school starts‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After talking to himself, he entered back into the house to finish preparations.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having said that, washing his face, preparing his meal, and changing clothes have already been done. Shidou rolled up his sleeves, tightened his tie, put on his blazer, and left home with his school bag in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having ample time, Shidou may have been inspired by Mukuro's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was now March during his third year in high school. There wasn't much time left until the graduation ceremony. There will only be a few more times he would go into the school building which he had been attending for three years. Indeed, there were a myriad of sentiments for that place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially‐‐since that school contained so many special memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, a faint hint of sentimentality struck his chest. Shidou turned to look up at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aside from not wanting the tears to flow, for some reason he suddenly wanted to look up at the blue sky. The deep blue sky, it was a place where long vapor trails lingered faintly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nowa……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very next moment, after he heard that voice in his ear, Shidou's body instinctively bended back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou turned his eyes around in a flustered state. What appeared in front of him was a girl whom he had no idea how long was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Faintly pigmented hair that reached the top of her shoulders and a graceful face just like a doll, she was wearing a Raizen High School uniform just like Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tobiichi Origami, she was Shidou's classmate and another one of the former Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Aah……good morning, Origami."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickly recognized the girl and replied with a forced smile. He corrected his unnatural posture and turned around to her direction. Although Origami's facial expression didn't change much, she still nodded back to Shidou in satisfaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? By the way……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Shidou slanted his head a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't the first or second time Origami had unpredictably appeared. Unlike Yoshino and the others, she lived in her own home in the city rather than the mansion next door. If she was going to school normally, she wouldn't need to pass in front of Shidou's house.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps guessing from his expression that he was thinking of this, Origami quietly moved her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I want to go to school with Shidou. No good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Confronted by Origami's gesture of slanting her head to the side as if peeking through his own expression, Shidou couldn't help but be stunned as he took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite the change in facial expression being modest, that subtle gesture felt a little cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……no, it's not no good. Let's go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou finished speaking, Origami lined up next to him to walk side by side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tried keeping the same pace as Origami while walking towards school.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, if this was full-fledged sprint, Shidou wouldn't be able to keep up with Origami. Even if she was just walking normally, Origami ought to be able to keep pace with Shidou one step at a time. ……Well, for Shidou who never had any experience walking with girls, he only began to notice this matter two years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, isn't that a little bit uncertain?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"? What is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">On the way, Shidou asked while walking slowly as Origami curiously replied back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, see, it's the timing. I left home earlier than usual. Perhaps Origami made a great effort to come here, but there was also the chance of us completely missing each other."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. It's within my expectations that Shidou is going to school earlier than usual."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that right? How on earth……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woman's intuition. The frequency is a business secret."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What frequency!? Shouldn't it just be intuition!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love frequency."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, phrasing it like that makes it sound like J-pop lyrics!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted loudly, but Origami replied back to him as if nothing happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just kidding. ‐‐I was simply going to wait until Shidou came out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, in that case……how long have you been waiting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked that, Origami relaxed her face and said "secret".</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost too small to be called a smile, but a faint smile nonetheless. However, considering in the past where Origami kept her emotions hidden behind an iron mask, this was quite the unimaginable change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">One year had passed since that battle had ended. Little by little, Origami was also changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, nothing……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Likely due to the fact he was silently staring at her face, Origami replied back with a suspicious gaze. Shidou gave an unclear smile to dodge the question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just think it's rare for Origami to come here before school. Is it because graduation is coming soon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true. But also‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked again, Origami continued while raising her lips ever so slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I wanted to walk once from this point of view."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh?'</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite him being confused over what she had said, Origami didn't answer the question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately afterwards, she shifted the topic by saying "compared to that".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are Kaguya and Yuzuru competing today? I don't see them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Ah, right……it seems they're competing on who gets to school first. Both of them said that they wanted to settle the tie-breaker before graduation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those two are still the same as usual."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahaha……that sounds about right."</p>
<p class="null-p">While still feeling a little confused, Shidou kept this causal conversation going while on the way to school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Nooo‐‐, only one more week until the graduation ceremony‐‐!</p>
<p class="null-p">Reaaaaly, I'll be so lonely when thinking that everyone will be gone‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice, which was not in the slightest lonely, was said in complete contrast to the contents of those words. It came from Shidou's homeroom teacher, Okamine Tamae, or more commonly known as Tama-chan sensei.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a small woman wearing glasses with narrow edges. Despite her child-like face causing her to be normally mistaken of being a student, her glimmering eyes and glossy skin right now made her look even younger than usual. If someone said that she was a primary school student waiting for an outing, there may be people believing this until the last minute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, Tama-chan was not at odds with her students. She was not the sort of person to weave sarcasm and bitter jokes into conversation. It would be too regretful to reluctantly part with her students in this manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">But right now, her joy was much greater than the loneliness haunting her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhuh‐‐but now it's already like this, on the day of the graduation sensei might cry out‐‐! Ah, so lonely, so lonely‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Tama-chan sensei raised her left hand to make it more conspicuous‐‐to be more precise, her mouth was grinning while showing off the shining ring on her finger. ……It gave the impression that she wanted someone to point it out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…….U-Uhhh, Tama-chan? That ring……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A student among those smiling raised his voice; it was Shidou's undesirable friend Tonomachi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Tama-chan departed for the teacher's desk as if waiting for someone to say that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Have you noticed it! Opps, that's a real headache! I was trying to make it inconspicuous!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite all of the students giving a "that's a lie……" expression, Tama-chan didn't notice and continued to exaggerate her movements as if illuminated by a spotlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually sensei‐‐will finally make her marriage debut☆! Tada!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With comical expressions just like in a manga, Tama-chan rolled those words off her tongue. Of course, even at this moment, she didn't forget to show off the appeal of the ring on her left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps it was the first time for everyone seeing Tama-chan in high spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? And the other person is? A handsome prince with high income and high education! Nfufu, a gentlemen who perfectly escorts me on a date! His voice sounds just like a Snufkin!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She began to talk about details about her marriage partner even though no one was listening. The image of someone who was too good to be true, the noisy Ai, Mai, Mii trio in this class had sweat dripping down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey……what's with this super excellent thing? Does this person really exist?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you really okay? Did Tama-chan encounter a marriage scam……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that fiancé just part of your imagination?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nfufufu! I won't respond to anything today! The world is so beautiful! Life is beautiful!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Tama-chan raised both of her hands. At the same time, confetti flew around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apparently, Tama-chan had already prepared it in her pocket. This noisy cheer was unthinkable coming from her normally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the students were confused by Tama-chan's festive manner, they still gave their blessings to her. Despite the wry smiles, everyone warmly watched over Tama-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐……so even Tama-chan is getting married."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't expect that such a rare event would happen during my school days."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But when Tama-chan, who's nicknamed Raizen's Final Defense Line, is getting engaged, wouldn't it cause the other teachers to feel anxious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Ai Mai, and Mii turned around to look at the back of the classroom‐‐or more accurately towards the female teacher who was standing there. As if guided by that action, the other students also turned their sights to there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……W-What is it? Why are you all staring to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly taken aback by everyone's eyes on her, the female teacher frowned while taking a step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a foreign woman characterized by pale Nordic blonde hair and white skin. Her pale skin made her flushed cheeks even more noticeable. While not necessarily child-like as Tama-chan,</p>
<p class="null-p">her youthful appearance made it so that the dark color suit she was wearing didn't match her looks.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Ellen Mira Mathers</p>
<p class="null-p">She was one of the founders of DEM, a rival organization to <Ratatoskr>, and also known as the world's strongest Wizard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Even though it's nearly been a year, it still feels kind of strange." Shidou whispered as he smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Origami, who was sitting on Shidou's right side, nodded lightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still don't trust her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gave a strained laugh at Origami's sharp criticism. However, as someone who crossed blades with her on the battlefield, this may have been inevitable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I was surprised to hear that she suddenly lost her memories……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Shidou wasn't at the scene at the time, the only heard the details after the fact‐‐after the final battle a year ago, Ellen, who had lost Westcott, completely lost her memories and knowledge about DEM and Westcott after waking up from a coma.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the reasons were unclear, after waking up Ellen showed no malice or hostility and was only happy to be reunited with Woodman and Karen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not impossible in of itself. Ellen was a strong follower of Westcott. The possibility of her losing her memories in shock of Westcott's death cannot be denied. There's also the possibility of her not being able to endure that fact and erased her own memories with the Realizer Manifestation Device.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked that, Origami continued speaking in a low voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A Wizard has a transmitter embedded on their brain to operate the Realizer</p>
<p class="null-p">Manifestation Device. If something that precise was crafted for Ellen……"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"You mean……Westcott is responsible?"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Westcott arranged for Ellen to lose her memories at the same time as his death……? Shidou frowned since this ran in contrary to that man's usual style.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know. It's just a possibility."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his head as he let out an "hmm?" sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You may be thinking too much, if you don't trust her……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As long as the memory loss may be her act, it's impossible to deny the chance that her memory may be arranged to be revived after a certain period of time. In case of an emergency, I purposed to plant insurance in Ellen's transmitter device."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Insurance……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those words being said so calmly, Shidou felt cold sweat dripping down his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Origami slightly shook her head at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not what you think. I didn't purpose to place a bomb or poison in there. However, when Ellen is determined to have taken hostile action, the transmitter is programed to stop functioning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen without the Realizer Manifestation Device isn't a huge threat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh……so it's like that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou crossed his arms together in agreement to Origami's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this may indeed be a necessary measure. As a Wizard, Ellen's strength was quite literally the strongest in the world. Now that they lost the power of the Spirits, Shidou and the others would have no method to defeat her if she attacked with full hostility.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having said that, at least during this year, Shidou didn't find Ellen doing anything strange. Shidou once again smiled as he watched Ellen being swayed back and forth by the Ai, Mai, and Mii trio.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he had heard there was quite a debate over the treatment of Ellen's status, but based on Woodman's personal opinion, she was finally allowed to work as an employee of <Ratatoskr>.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at that moment, when speaking of a vacancy in <Ratatoskr>'s positions‐‐she was entrusted to the supporting role that Reine once had.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so that's how the story of deputy teacher Ellen began. In the past, she had tried to infiltrate the school as a traveling photographer, so some students who remembered her face were surprised. But she seemed generally welcomed by everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I wonder if Ellen-san is around marriageable age as well. Speak honestly Ellen-san. Is there anyone special? Hm? Tell all about it to Ai-chan. Now don't worry about it, I won't say anything to anyone else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ellen-san is so beautiful and looks to be able to find a boyfriend right away. But I don't hear any rumors at all. Are you skillfully keeping it under wraps? Or is it some problem your partner is keeping?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh……no way, are you not interested in males? Oh, that really bother me……although Ellen-san's feelings are nice, girls are a little……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did the conversation turn to me? Rather don't drag me into the topic!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen screamed at the Ai, Mai, and Mii trio's questioning. However, the trio didn't care about this as they began touching Ellen's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, this suit is too scary. Go shopping with us next time Ellen-san!</p>
<p class="null-p">Your foundation is good, so you'll definitely be popular if you dress up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, good idea. There are clothes that I want Ellen-san to try. There are some clothes that just don't suit you. But Ellen-san has a nice body, so the style will naturally match that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Your skin is so white and hair so glossy……tunku……what is this feeling? I'm not interested in girls but I'm getting nervous. As expected of</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen-san, with a good dress you'll be invincible and the absolute strongest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Strongest……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Ellen seemed to recall something, she pressed against her head to suppress a headache.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is this sweet noise‐‐uh, my head……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling the touch from the Ai, Mai, and Mii trio to be unpleasant, she tried flailing her limbs to shake them off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sadly however, Ellen without the Realizer manifestation device was at the level where a game of arm wrestling against a (lower level) primary student would develop with great tension. She couldn't break free from their claws as she was being unilaterally stroked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tama-chan, who was still in a euphoric state, said "Ufufu, get along everyone" while smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahaha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, home room was as lively as ever. Shidou laughed while looking out through the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Then, the seat by the window, which had been left vacant for a year, entered into Shidou's view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou sighed as he looked towards the blue sky from the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the noisy classroom, Origami silently looked on at Shidou from the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">His face was seen from the side‐‐but Shidou wasn't looking straight forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the empty window seat with no one there and then he eventually turned towards the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">His gaze looked lonely but also somewhat gentle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami wasn't a God, so it was impossible to fully read into Shidou's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">But for the time being, there was one thing Origami was convinced of.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐That Shidou was thinking the same thing as Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">No, but that is why Origami took this action.</p>
<p class="null-p">She secretly avoided the teacher's gaze and took out her phone to send a message to Shidou,</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds, Shidou raised his eyebrows as if noticing something. Then, he took out his phone and looked at the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming Origami's message, Shidou widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami replied with a small nod, returning Shidou's gaze‐‐after that her line of sight passed Shidou's shoulders and towards the empty seat by the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐One year.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the final battle against DEM.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the fight against the Spirit of Origin.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that girl disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">One year had already passed.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"One year……huh. It's gone by soon quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nighttime, at the captain's seat of the airborne ship <Fraxinus>which was 15,000 meters above Tenguu City, Kotori whispered while stirring the Chupa Chups stick in her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike her white sailor suit worn during daytime, she was now wearing military clothes dyed in a crimson hue. The ribbon tying her hair also changed from white to black. It was <Fraxinus>'s captain, Itsuka Kotori's commander mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, since one year ago, the frequency of entering this mode and coming onboard</p>
<p class="null-p"><Fraxinus>had gradually decreased.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was only natural. Around the same time one year ago, the Spirit of Origin disappeared and everyone lost their Reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Additionally, at the same time, Isaac Westcott, the leader of DEM and</p>
<p class="null-p"><Ratatoskr>'s enemy, had passed away. DEM, which had lost Westcott's strong central pull and influence, was in the midst of internal strife even after a year due to the anti-Westcott factions. Of course, Kotori continued to despise their enemy, but grudges had no more meaning after their strength unavoidably weakened.</p>
<p class="null-p">In any case, <Ratatoskr>'s greatest goal of sealing the power of the Spirits and allowing them to live a normal life has basically been achieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, they would continue supporting everyone, so it wasn't as if they would be unemployed. But since there was no appearance of any new Spirits and the fear of the reversal of Reiryoku was gone, it can be said that most of their urgent matters had already been completed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Oya, is Kotori also remembering the old days?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice was heard coming right next to the captain's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl in a <Ratatoskr>uniform was gazing towards Kotori while slightly shaking her long hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's troublesome to always be considered a child by you, Maria. People will grow up. I am going to be a high school student next month. Being nostalgic for the past will only cause me to be more bothered by stiffened shoulders." "I feel like you've always been complaining about stiffened shoulders."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori joked and shrugged her shoulders, the girl‐‐Maria, suddenly smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hey. Even I will be occasionally jealous of you. Maria's body doesn't have that sort of problems?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be precise, switching states arbitrarily is possible. I can basically turn it on. Negative information is also indispensable for reproducing human body functions."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Maria rubbed her own shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, the girl standing in front of Kotori was not a human but the <Fraxinus>management AI using an inter-personal communication body to converse with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Created by the Realizer Manifestation Device, she had a prosthetic body that could fully reproduce the texture of human skin and even secrete bodily fluids such as sweat and saliva. To be honest, if Kotori wasn't aware of Maria's origins, there was no way she could tell that body was an artificial product.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, I wonder what that's like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, only on that point I will not yield. I also have my own reasons for my shoulders being susceptible to aches."</p>
<p class="null-p">In that manner, Maria proudly raised her chest. Kotori smiled unintentionally at those human-like words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria gave a strange look to the left side of the captain's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is Kannazuki beginning to do now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Over there for some reason, a tall man had his hands on the floor with his entire body trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was <Ratatoskr>'s vice captain, Kannazuki Kyohei.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Commander……the commander will be a high school student starting next month……even though I understand this, there's a heartbreaking feeling when hearing it out loud once again……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki replied, crying while shaking his fist. Maria gave a look of disgust at the tears polluting the interior of the ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're saying something without any meaning again……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no……even after becoming a high school student, the commander's charm is not discounted. Just, just……! Between a middle school boss and a high school boss, there is an insurmountable wall……! It's to cruel to understand that this is irreversible, the sadness of those parts swelling and inflating out‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori lifted her feet in a silent manner and dropped her heel at Kannazuki's medulla oblongata.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gyaun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kannazuki squatted on the bridge just like a crushed frog. Maria's expression of disgust grew even more profound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Aah……the weight of this kick……so this is……growth……? T-This way, even with loss, there is also something gained……the world is so beautiful……"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so Kannazuki muttered while groaning with an expression full of ecstasy. Seeing the same expression as usual, Kotori exhaled out a big sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, restrain yourself a little more. Didn't you only recently get engaged? Doing something like this will cause you to be hated by your partner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's no problem. The commander is in another stomach. I really love my honey."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, yes. Speaking of which, I haven't asked yet but what sort of person is she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's a woman who looks like a junior high student even though she's an adult."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow this felt like being Kannazuki's style.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori sighed as if giving up as she stood up from the captain's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you like to go back, Kotori?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The regular report is over now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? ‐‐Oh, the transfer device is that way……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the direction Kotori was walking, Maria tilted her head a little in curiosity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐there's a little business I have to deal with first."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori obscured her words as she left the bridge while waving her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then continuing along that passageway, she located at the document room located in the rear of</p>
<p class="null-p"><Fraxinus>. As Kotori faced the camera on the door, the face recognition was automatically completed as the door opened with a beep sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite being called a document room, there were no books or documents lined up here. Instead, there was a dedicated terminal that could be used to access the <Ratatoskr>database.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, if it was just basic data, it could be viewed from Kotori's personal terminal. In this manner, it wouldn't be possible to browse more specialized information or top secret materials that were forbidden to be taken outside without authorization.</p>
<p class="null-p">And‐‐ "……Oh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, who stepped into the room, lightly raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something you want to investigate, Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Kotori's voice coming from behind, Shidou, who was sitting in front of the terminal, looked back with startled shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Aah……just a little."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou forced a smile as sweat traveled down from his forehead. At the same time, his body deliberately moved to shield the terminal screen from Kotori's view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori narrowed her eyes slightly‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">A large yell followed by a finger pointed off to the distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!? W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou took the bait and raised his face, Kotori kicked off against the floor and pushed his shoulder aside to see the terminal screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What? The Spirit Composition Formula……and also <Zafkiel>? Opps, I thought you were thinking up something terrible like fishing through everyone's medical checkups."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I would never do that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori said that with her eyes half closed, Shidou screamed as his face turned reddish. Well, in the first place, those photos are set with a protection program so they can't be seen with the male staff's authentication rights.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what did you want to know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou faltered as he looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few minutes of silence, Kotori lightly sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is it about Tohka?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As those words were muttered out, Shidou was clearly holding his breath. Kotori then sighed once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Yatogami Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">That name was special among Kotori and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the exception of Kotori, she was the first Spirit whose powers Shidou had sealed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like the Spirit of Origin, a pure Spirit that lacked a human foundation.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also‐‐the Spirit that disappeared in front of everyone one year ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the world where everyone was saved and lived a peaceful life, she was the only Spirit that wasn't saved. That was‐‐the girl named Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka was a gentle, cheerful, and optimistic girl who could make everyone full of energy. Even if she didn't dare say it, the memories of Tohka were deeply ingrained in Kotori's heart. Shidou should be the same, but this</p>
<p class="null-p">was‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It doesn't matter that you're thinking about Tohka. I'm not telling you to forget her.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐But, Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori said that while looking directly into Shidou's eyes, Shidou lowered his eyes as if he was resigning to that idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I know. I don't think I'm going to attempt another Spirit Ceremony or try to recreate</p>
<p class="null-p"><Zafkiel>. I just wanted to know more about Spirits."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐If there was the slightest possibility of something changing by just</p>
<p class="null-p">knowing‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words weren't muttered from Shidou's mouth, but Kotori managed to understand it. She let out a few more sighs as she scratched her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm not intending to stop you. Moreover, the really dangerous information has been set up with a protection program. Look and think it over until you're satisfied. Just‐‐it will be very painful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………If I don't do anything, it will be even more painful. ……Because like that, I feel like I have accepted Tohka's disappearance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not being able to reply back to his, Kotori lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, seeing Kotori give a similar look, Shidou awkwardly scratched his cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……But, forget about it, I'll stop here today. After all, there are still things to do tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yeah, that'll be good. If you can't get up in the morning or sleep too late, I will dance on your stomach."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have to spare me……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shrugged, closing the terminal screen as he stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, just as he was about to leave the document room, he suddenly stopped and turned around to Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, Kotori‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did you come here to investigate about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Ah‐‐……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Shidou had asked, Kotori quickly looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. After all Kotori‐‐she wasn't the type that could give wise advice to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt a sense of relief, lightly waving his hand as he walked away from the reference room.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Looking back, Spacequakes really are gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were at a coffee shop in the outskirts of Tenguu City.</p>
<p class="null-p">The JDSF commanding officer of AST, Kusakabe Ryouko, said that while taking a sip of the famous royal milk tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hair was tied in a ponytail, her long sharp eyes like slits; she was a tall woman with flexible muscles supporting her entire body. Rather than wearing AST equipment or work clothes, she was wearing a causal shirt and denim jeans.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……it's been about a year now. Since observing that huge response, no new reactions have been discovered."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, has that much time passed? But there are records showing periods of time 31 years ago where no new Spacequakes have been observed. Maybe it's cyclical?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Ryouko's voice fell, other voices coming from a girl with a kitten-like atmosphere and a girl with thin-rimmed glasses soon followed suit. They were Ryouko's subordinate Okamine Mikie and AST's mechanic Mildred F. Fujimura. Both of them were leaning their heads as they were eating the cake that was served along with their tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">While watching their interaction, Tobiichi Origami lifted up her cup to sip the tea. The fragrance of the vivid tea leaves entered into her nostrils as that gentle sweetness was transmitted within a single beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">In retrospect, this was the first time in a while where they had all gathered together. In the past, they met several times when Origami was still within the AST. But after she became a Spirit and entered into <Ratatoskr>'s protection, they had few opportunities to meet up.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the atmosphere of them talking in an easy-going manner hadn't changed in the slightest. Origami breathed out a sigh of relief from this mysterious feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite having said that, of course there were still noticeable differences from those days. The biggest thing would be‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Eh? Would Spacequake even happen anymore? I heard that the Spirit of Origin disappeared, so there are no more Spirits……"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a surprised look, there was one girl who was leaking that confidential information.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's blonde hair was as bright as the sun and her blue eyes were as soft as the seas. Her calm expression somehow exuded a warm atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">Artemisia Bell Ashcroft, she was the former British Anti-Spirit SSS ace and the number two executive Wizard of DEM industries.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, to be more precise, she has since left DEM and was currently attending university and studying psychology.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Ha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Spirits……don't exist anymore?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Are Milly and the others listening to confidential information right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Artemisia just said, Ryouko and the others opened both their mouths and eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami quietly tapped Artemisia's flank.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Artemisia."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah……did I say something I shouldn't have? Ah……uh, sorry that was perhaps just my misunderstanding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're terrible at lying!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Ryouko couldn't help but shout, Artemisia slanted her head and stuck out her tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Ryouko immediately sighed while scratching her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, weren't you a part of DEM a year ago? It's better not to leak any information you've seen and heard. ……You as well, while a lot of things may have happened, to have actually joined that company."</p>
<p class="null-p">After she finished saying that, Ryouko half-closed her eyes as she rested her hand against her chin. Milly nodded in agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. I don't understand why anyone would want to join such a black hearted company."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't you have a job in DEM before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Ryouko asked that, Milly said with a smirk, "Ah‐‐is that right? I don't remember!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In contrast, Artemisia had a difficult expression on her face. She crossed her arms while muttering something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un……actually, I don't remember as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't remember……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, why did I go to DEM, what I did while there……? I feel like there is something clouding my mind. I can recall everything before going there, but only the memories of that period are left strangely vague."</p>
<p class="null-p">Artemisia spoke while placing her hand against her forehead. Ryouko, Mikie, and Milly all gave a look of concern.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what's with that horrible situation……are you okay? Did those guys tamper with your head?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, it is that DEM……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's right. The guys in that company are all villains."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Ryouko quickly interjected once again, Milly spoke while crossing her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Artemisia tapped her fingertips against her forehead and rubbed her stomach as if trying to remember something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No……it sounds ridiculous to remember……but, yes. I have a memory of fighting Origami while out in space."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was really difficult."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you seriously do that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko shouted once again. However, immediately remembering they were still in a coffee shop, she coughed twice while trying to adjust her seating posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……But if there really isn't any Spacequakes occurring anymore……that's a bit dangerous if true. Aren't we at risk of being unemployed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, well the eradication of a major disaster should be a happy note……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mikie laughed at Ryouko's words. Ryouko replied back with, "That's true,</p>
<p class="null-p">but……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps you don't have to worry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Realizer is a miraculous device that shouldn't exist in this world. Its usefulness is not just limited to combat. Even if there is proof that</p>
<p class="null-p">Spacequakes will never happen again, so long as the heads of the government haven't lost their minds, it is impossible to dismiss the special people who can utilize that device‐‐Wizards."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Origami continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wizards are secretly deployed in the military and police of other countries. The value as a deterrent against other countries is immeasurable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well……that's certainly true. I just hope that we won't be used for that purpose."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps we are in an important position……I feel so nervous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that case, I hope they give us a salary increase."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Milly cheerfully laughed, Ryouko helplessly shrugged her shoulders while muttering out a</p>
<p class="null-p">"really……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Artemisia spoke with one finger on her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If there's an exception, then all of the other countries will have to let go of using the Realizer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't you think that DEM is in a mess right now? If the company that provides and maintains that device is torn apart……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko folded her arms while making a difficult face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Realizer Manifestation Device was a special device that could only be manufactured by DEM. If they were to fall, then there would be absolutely nothing that could be done.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, the exception was in Asgard Electronics, <Ratatoskr>'s parent company……but of course Origami didn't talk about this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that happens, I wonder if I'll have to go back to the accounting department where I use to belong. Ah……maybe it's time to think about finding a good partner and becoming a permanent housewife."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko sipped her cup of milk tea while letting out a heavy sigh. Mikie felt a bead of sweat traveling down from this sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Captain, you're still young, so I think you should be fine……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You only say that because you're young. It's just my negligence for letting my late twenties pass through. ‐‐Anyway, isn't this the sort of thing that women of all ages like to topic about?</p>
<p class="null-p">Do you have someone in mind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Ryouko looked in turn to everyone else on the table. Everyone could only laugh in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfortunately……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am sorry to say that there's no man who can match Milly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing everyone's answer, Ryouko reluctantly let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, everyone seems not to be in a rush as well. ‐‐How about you Origami? You didn't seem to say that you don't have a boyfriend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Origami was about to answer, the sounds of faint vibrations and a light ringtone began to flow from somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's me."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Artemisia took out a smartphone from her bag, tapping the call button and placing the phone against her ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello, Ashley? ‐‐Ah, yes. I know. Yes, okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a brief conversation, Artemisia ended the call and placed the phone back in her bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, there's somewhere I need to go. I have an appointment after this. Um, the money is‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, don't worry about it. Let your senior do something that she should do."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Artemisia had said, Ryouko shook her hand. Artemisia unexpectedly rounded her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-But……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Instead, show your face more often in the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fufu, I understand. See you next time. I had a lot of fun meeting everyone today.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Good-bye."</p>
<p class="null-p">Artemisia left with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko shortly sighed after she waved good-bye in turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Artemisia seems to be in good spirits. A natural airhead just like she was</p>
<p class="null-p">before……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The talk about DEM was a little disturbing, but it seems not knowing anything is for the best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko also nodded in agreement to Mikie's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So……we were going to find a place for a causal lunch. You want to come along, Origami?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I also have business to take care of after this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Business……what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Wedding."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ryouko and the others widened their eyes at those words.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">With the public water fountain in front of the station and the mysterious statue of the dog commonly known as Hachikō, Tenguu station had become a hugely advertisement dating spot for couples.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both are distinctive objects that can be seen immediately after exiting the ticket gate of the station. It's an easy recognizable spot even if you're visiting Tenguu City for the first time. So it was inevitable that it would be chosen as a meet up location.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at the same time, this meant the station was synonymous with being crowded. During days off, one could easily tell that the front of the station was jammed packed with countless people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pedestrians gathering to meet up, street musicians and guests watching their performances, and even the sounds of: "Over here, Ellen-san!" "Let's go over here!" "First of all, let's try underwear!" "Let‐‐me‐‐go‐‐!" from a group of noisy people‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite being a meeting spot, it was still created circumstances where it was difficult to find the person you were looking for.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Ah, found you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, who was visiting the station square, quickly found the person he was looking for facing in front to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami was standing in front of the fountain with prefect posture as if posing for a picture.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, Shidou had received a date invitation from her at school yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">There had already been several meetings with Origami here, but she would always arrive faster than the designated time and always wait for Shidou in the same position. So no matter how crowded, Shidou was able to find her without spending too much time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Origami's dignified presence creating a sense of isolation from her surroundings may also be one of the reasons.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you're early today as well, Origami. Have I kept you waiting?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have just arrived."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Origami turned her neck towards him while replying.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same exchange as usual. Shidou smiled from the mysterious sense of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, where are we going today? You said there was something you wanted to talk to me about‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Follow me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami spoke as she took Shidou's hand to guide him. She weaved her way through the crowds of countless people while walking at a brisk pace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, wait a minute. Can you tell me where we are going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll know right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami emotionlessly replied as they continued to walk forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few minutes, she stopped in front of a huge building.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou blinked as he raised his eyes to look up at the building. It was a highrise building where the number of floors couldn't be judged in a single glance. A magnificent appearance composed of rigid vertical lines and glass windows shining brightly under the sunlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">The name "Imperial Hotel Tenguu" was written at the top of the large entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What are you intending to do by bringing me here, Origami!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his voice as he tried to head back. However, he couldn't move from his wrist being firmly held by Origami. This grip strength was unthinkable coming from Origami's slender body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't misunderstand. I don't intend to stay here overnight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing Origami's answer, Shidou replied while wrinkling his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, truth be told, this was a luxury hotel complete with a variety of facilities rather than just being an ordinary hotel Origami would take him for 'rest'. A wide variety of restaurants were available and a shopping area was located on the ground floor. It wasn't a strange place for a date.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true……sorry, Origami + hotel = danger, that sort of thought process has already been imprinted onto my body."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll take that as a compliment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami replied back, taking no offense to that comment as she walked into the hotel with Shidou in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">High ceilings garnished with a chandelier. The soles of his feet made a loud noise, but even the sound of footsteps were concealed as they soon began walking on the carpet. This was a luxurious building unimaginable from the modern exterior.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou didn't have many opportunities entering a luxurious hotel that often. He looked around in open amazement. However, Origami didn't seem to care for this as she crossed the entrance in a straight line.</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards they headed straight towards the back of the hotel‐‐she finally stopped in a certain area.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the sights around him, Shidou raised his head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no wonder. In front of him were several pure white dresses in various designs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Welcome, do you have an appointment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it's an appointment under the name Itsuka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Greetings, Itsuka-sama. We have been expecting you. My name is Kurita and I will be in charge today. Nice to meet you. ‐‐Please come over here"</p>
<p class="null-p">A woman who appeared to be a hotel employee politely responded to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was left shocked, Origami guided his hand to sit him down on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou twisted his neck from being unable to measure the situation, the woman named Kurita began serving tea to them. Afterwards, she spread out something resembling a pamphlet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First of all, congratulations to you, Itsuka-sama. ‐‐You can choose from these dresses for the booked bridal course. Which do you prefer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you think, Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………Ehhhhhhh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami's cheeks turned slightly red as she gently leaned over on Shidou's shoulders. With a confounded look, Shidou alternated between looking at Origami and the pamphlet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Um, uhh, I can't quite keep up with the current situation, but what am I supposed to be choosing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My wedding dress."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Origami, you're getting married?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be precise, I have already obtained the certificate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………With who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked that, Origami looked a bit embarrassed as she pointed to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At last, his sense of understanding had caught up. Shidou unintentionally screamed, causing Kurita who was sitting in front of them to jolt her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Wait a moment. Certificate……when did that happened!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Last Monday. A very auspicious day for all sorts of things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I don't remember any of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have submitted my marriage application."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that something that shouldn't be submitted without permission!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was shouting, Origami placed her hand on his shoulder while saying, "Calm down".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Think calmly, Shidou. How old are you now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha……? O-Of course I am 18 years old……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, me too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-So why……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a huge problem!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This matter was nothing but a problem. Shidou clutched his head and yelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing him react this way, Origami gently slanted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does Shidou hate marrying me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's not that I would hate it……but it should only be possible after mutual agreement……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does Shidou hate me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, like I said……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was left in a state of being unable to speak, Origami couldn't keep holding back her laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Just kidding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A stylish Oririn joke. Were you surprised?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Origami stared at Shidou's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stopped breathing for a few seconds before finally exhaling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Origami, you……almost scared me enough to have a heart attack……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By no means did I think of breaking into your cupboards to take your personal seal. Kotori is a terrifying child."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you actually attempted that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou once again let out a sorrowful cry. Origami gave another amused smile. ……Looks like those words were also a joke. Shidou sighed helplessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami laughed for a while, but then turned her eyes downward as she muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I haven't heard Shidou yell in a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, hearing something like that would definitely cause me to yell……."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou replied in a scolding manner, Origami quietly continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This year, no matter how cheerful you acted, there was always the feeling of being listless."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Origami say that, Shidou held his breath for a moment‐‐it was the feeling of being completely seen through.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami revealed a gentle but lonely smile as she picked up the brochure on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou, which one do you think suits me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh‐‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, the plan was originally to only take a commemorative photo of a dress. Can you go along with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Aah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pressed on by this momentum, Shidou gently nodded as he pointed to a dress that he thought was perfect for Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">About an hour later.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was sitting in a chair in the waiting room and staring into the open void.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was wearing a carefully crafted white tuxedo. Yes, if they were to take a wedding photo, then he had to dress up correspondingly as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Strictly speaking, Shidou had once dressed up once in a similar manner, but that didn't mean he was used to this. His shoulders twitched slightly from a cramp.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this uncomfortable feeling he remembered now wasn't just because of this gorgeous attire. He whispered in a low voice that was too small to hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I looked listless, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">The words that Origami had said kept lingering in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐One year had passed since Tohka disappeared. Regrets still remained in Shidou's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Shidou could understand in his mind. Since Tohka was a pure Spirit, that ending was inevitable.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other Spirits were safe and sound. Even though Mio had also disappeared, it could be said that she had achieved her wish. Tohka was also able to enjoy her last moments happily thanks to Tenka. Even if he arrived back there again, he wouldn't be able to achieve any more results.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou suddenly thought about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did he really choose the right choice at that time? Was there anything else he still could have done?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tried to look calm to prevent the others from worrying, but Origami had already sense something was off. ……No, even if they didn't choose to say it, perhaps everyone also thought so as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not wanting to make everyone worry turned about to be counterproductive. Shidou groaned as he awkwardly folded his arms together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐The groom, your bride is ready."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just then, the door to the room opened as the previous employee Kurita came out. Shidou hurriedly unraveled his arms and stood up from the chair to face her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. ……But strictly speaking, I'm not the official groom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's true. Excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurita let out a fufu laugh as she covered her mouth with her hand……How to describe it? She was exuding the calmness of an adult to specifically engage with frivolous and young couples.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, proceed over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou followed Kurita walking down the hallway and arrived at the room where Origami was waiting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pardon me."</p>
<p class="null-p">After several knocks, Kurita opened the door. Shidou stepped into the room as prompted.</p>
<p class="null-p">And‐‐ "‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Shidou was rendered speechless.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was only natural. Origami wearing a pure white wedding dress was so beautiful that it was breathtaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">A thin silk veil covered her thinly pigmented hair. The light shining through the window caused her dress to sparkle like stardust. Probably, Origami applied her own makeup to best suit this dress. The light lipstick on her white face outlined a faint smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">The look was reminiscent of when Origami was a Spirit. ‐‐Today's Origami was shrouded just like a mysterious beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐What's wrong? Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh……you look good. To be honest, I was shocked."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Shidou looks good as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahaha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was too embarrassing to be praised by such a beauty. Shidou bashfully smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Kurita, who watching the two of them smile, offered her encouragement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, let's start taking some pictures of you two. There's a chapel behind this hotel, so let's head there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, okay. Then, let's go Origami."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Un."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gently nodded as she placed her hand around Shidou's arm. ‐‐It felt completely different from the hand guiding him to this hotel earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou laughed at the difference as he walked down the corridor to escort Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Shidou. Do you remember the first time we met?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah‐‐I remember. Both times."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou responded while shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, strangely enough, Shidou and Origami's first encounter had occurred twice.</p>
<p class="null-p">For Origami, it was during that huge fire 6 years ago. For Shidou, it was subjectively when he just became a second year student in high school.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gently nodded as she continued speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As soon as we were in the same class, Shidou confessed to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ga……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou couldn't help but cough at what Origami had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou also remembered this well. ‐‐Just when Shidou was put in charge of capturing Spirits, Origami, as a classmate, had been chosen as a training partner to persuade girls. Of course, when Origami came under <Ratatoskr>'s protection, he explained the circumstances around this……</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-Uhhhh, Origami. That's certainly true, but……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A confession is a still a confession. Take responsibility for what you have said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What you say is absolutely true."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was clear argument with no room for rebuttal. Shidou shrugged his shoulders while whispering to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to say that the problem was from <Ratatoskr>'s side from using classmates as practice without permission. But there was nothing wrong with what Origami said even when taking that regard in consideration.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Origami continued on with a "but".</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I said before, the emotion I had for Shidou at the time was surely just dependence. Trying to fill what I lacked in myself with you, in that sense I wasn't qualified to accept that confession."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Origami……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slightly frowned as he shook his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you. I was honored to have been relied on by you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami smiled happily while looking up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Shidou. But it's okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if to match this, the front door opened to shine light onto the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">A vast space appeared behind the hotel. A white chapel was sitting on top of the stone ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, wrapped in the dazzling light, gazed into Shidou's eyes while speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐This time, I can say with confidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The feeling in my heart is unmistakably‐‐love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's eyes stared as if raptured by Origami's appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">A figure wearing a veil of light.</p>
<p class="null-p">A beautiful expression arrived after overcoming countless battles and anguish.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked just like a real angel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Now, please stand in front of the chapel, you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurita's voice shook Shidou's shoulders free from its petrification.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go, Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Aah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami gently urged him. Shidou lightly nodded as he walked in front of the chapel with Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the photographer standing next to Kurita gave them detailed instructions while looking through the viewfinder. Shidou and Origami made small adjustments to their posture as they gave a smile towards the lens.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'll take the picture now. Say, cheese‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's eyes widened from surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was to be expected. After all, just as the shutter was about to be released, Origami pulled on his hand and gently kissed him on the cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the shutter went off. Her veil fluttered from the wind. An "ara, ara" came from Kurita who was grinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if in sync with the sound from the shutter, the white pigeons on the chapel flew into the sky all at once.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Thank you for today. It was fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">The tumultuous photograph session had come to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami, who had changed back into her clothes, spoke in front of the fountain they had chosen as their meeting place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I'm very happy as well. ……There were so many unexpected things……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's cheeks were slightly red as he scratched his head. Seeing Shidou act this way, Origami slightly loosen her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, but if possible don't let too many people see those pictures. Otherwise the situation will be difficult to clean up……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. ‐‐Until my and Shidou's real wedding, I won't show this to anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou smiled wryly, Origami closed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Today's photoshoot, there was one thing I was determined to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Determined……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Origami nodded and then continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The power of the Spirits has disappeared from this world. Even if the mental state of the former Spirits are in chaos, it won't cause Reiryoku to flow back and no more disaster will occur. That means‐‐Shidou, it doesn't matter if you specifically choose someone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to that, sweat flowed down from Shidou's cheeks. It wasn't as if he didn't understand what Origami was saying……but he still felt overwhelmed hearing that in person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But Shidou. In your heart now‐‐there's definitely Tohka's shadow. No matter how much a year has passed, nothing has changed. ……No, on the contrary it's even much stronger than from last year."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I don't know if it's love or affection. However, for sure until that feeling persists, Shidou will not be able to choose anyone else. With Tohka gone, I will be happy by myself‐‐somewhere in your heart, you've begun thinking like that……but because you are like that, I will always love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou fell silent at Origami's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Origami slowly opened her eyes and looked into Shidou's own eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will try to forget about Tohka‐‐my old self may have said something along those lines.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Origami continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the current me doesn't think like that anymore. ‐‐If you forget about</p>
<p class="null-p">Tohka, I will never forgive you. A Shidou like that doesn't deserve my love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While staring directly into Shidou's eyes, Origami made her declaration. Looking at the burning light with flames of strong determination in her eyes, Shidou involuntarily held his breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this was different from any trembling caused by fear and panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">If anything‐‐it felt like he had a strong companion by his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……I think so too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. So I will‐‐surpass Tohka and become the best woman. Even if you continue to hold Tohka in your heart, you won't be able to ignore my love."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tap, Origami's finger touched Shidou's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if shooting through his heart with a gun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widened his eyes for a moment‐‐ "……Aah, I'm looking forward to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">He smiled and replied so.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Twilight, the moment where the evening sun sets, it is said that the word is derived from the expression who are you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who are you? In other words, that moment is so dark that even the face of a person walking in the distance couldn't be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only the shadows of a person could be visible. But you don't know who it is. It could be a close acquaintance, a stranger, or perhaps even something magical.</p>
<p class="null-p">Darkness invokes a primal human fear. This doesn't change even after humans have acquired the power of electricity from civilization.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because of this,</p>
<p class="null-p">Twilight is also called the witching hour.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling the signs of something appearing behind, Origami's entire body was strained with tension.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she turned around, Origami kept her posture low and looked around without hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other side didn't try concealing or even killing the sounds of footsteps as the shadows of that figure revealed itself in an extremely causal manner,</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Who is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She asked but that person didn't respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">The distance was too far. That person's face couldn't be seen. But Origami could clearly feel there was no hostility or murderous intent, only a whirlpool of negative emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A, a, a, a‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Intermittently, a hoarse voice was given off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaaaaaaaaa‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Accompanied by that roar, the figure leaped towards Origami. Origami grimaced as she raised her hands to prepare to counterattack.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! You are‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the distance of twilight was crossed over, Origami saw it.</p>
<p class="null-p">That face was dyed with despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">The claws of the beast slashed through Origami's chest.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2: Honjou Nia</p>
<p class="null-p">I became a Spirit, uhh how long ago was that? Ah, yes, um. It was when Dimensional Knight Granger was still broadcasting. ……Hmm? Don't know? That masterpiece? Are you serious?</p>
<p class="null-p">Want to see it? I have it at home. It's on VHS.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Well, leaving that aside. Let's return back to the topic of Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm, if asked if I hated it. Of course, so many things had happened. No longer being able to trust humans, being captured by DEM and having my brains boggled. The breasts that were F</p>
<p class="null-p">cup before being reduced……hmm? They were like that originally? Anyway, the point is that any high-performance Angel will never be balanced.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that's also true. If I didn't become a Spirit, I would have never met Boy and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Drawing ordinary manga, an ordinary serialization, and ordinary sales…… ah, opps, I wanted to say something nice, but it's troublesome that my original life was going well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Um, well, how to describe it. But there are things you grow accustomed to that you can't just do by yourself. A mangaka can only get serious on the drawing paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the time being, I can say that it is fun to play with everyone and that Boy's meals is delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, isn't there nothing more important than taking an expansive view on one's life?</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori received the call as she was at the café "La Pucelle" with the other junior high members Yoshino, Mukuro, Mana, and Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori and the others had ordered the recommend seasonal cake set. The spring menu was strawberry shortcake with plenty of strawberries added on just like jewelry. Kotori, Yoshino, and Mukuro's eyes lit on in anticipation as they took out their smart phones to take a picture. Then, after pressing their hands together and saying "Itadakimasu", they stabbed the cake with their forks and let out an "ah" sound as they open their mouths.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori kept her mouth open as she turned her eyes to her phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the screen, the name "the single flower that blooms in the vast land Maria" was being displayed. In short, it was a call from Maria. ……Of course, Kotori has never registered Maria with this name before. Incidentally, last week was "Unreachable Maria" and the week before that it was "Beautiful Magician Household Maria". It seemed to change depending on the mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amu‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the cake had already been delivered to her mouth, so there was no reason to stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's cheeks bulged as she swallowed the cake. The smart phone continuously rang while she was still chewing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, aren't you going to listen to the phone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sitting diagonally across from her, Mana widened her eyes as she spoke. Kotori enjoyed the sweetness and sourness of the seasonal strawberries and then sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nhh, it's already been picked up. Isn't it rude to pick up the cake with the fork and then just put it back on the plate?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Mana scratched her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it wasn't as if this was an emergency. If it was urgent, the emergency line would be used.</p>
<p class="null-p">And above all else, if it was a serious topic, the name registered would only be "MARIA". As it was now, it was probably something silly like Kannazuki screaming something obscene on the bridge or Nia failing to let her liver take some rest from drinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">The cake was a fresh desert after all. The surface would dry out soon and worsen the taste. If the conversation would take too long, she should hang up now and call again‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori was thinking that over, she was about to tap the call button when the ringtone suddenly came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Kotori thought that the other party had given up on the call‐‐but it was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria's face appeared on the phone screen and her familiar voice was heard coming from the speaker.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, so you are here, Kotori. Hurry up and pick up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Startled by this sudden occurrence, Kotori shook her shoulders. Sitting around the same table, Yoshino and Natsumi also gave a look of surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Wait Maria, what are you doing!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's your question? I had something I wanted to discuss over the phone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm not talking about that! Why can you talk without me hitting the call button!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori asked that, the Maria on the screen pouted in displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's under my care, remote controlling a smart phone is as easy as getting all the color right on a Rubik's cube."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, isn't that metaphor difficult in of itself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi said that while half-squinting her eyes; in response, Maria carelessly blinked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I intended to use the simplest analogy‐‐ah, but please rest assured. I haven't implanted any remote control software in advance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it more terrifying that you can operate remotely without implementation!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori grunted out a "really……" as she shook her head. Then, she adjusted her gaze to look at Maria on the screen before continuing on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what did you want to talk about? What did Kannazuki do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh. I might be overthinking it‐‐it's just that some observed reaction has caught my attention."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……A reaction that has caught your attention?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to what Maria had said, Kotori raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, would it be better for me to head back?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, if possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……I see. I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori said that, she tapped the screen of the smartphone to hang up on the call.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she stuffed the rest of the cake in three mouthfuls and then let out a sigh of relief after gulping down the black tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Sorry guys, I have to head out first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem……but if something is wrong, why don't we all go together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, it should be fine. I don't think it's a big deal. Everyone else should take the time to enjoy the cake more slowly. Ah, take this to pay for the bill."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori handed the money to Mana and left the store while waving goodbye.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori took a refreshing step, unraveling her white ribbon while walking and replacing it with the black ribbon in her pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">After walking into an alley, Kotori felt the sensation of her body floating‐‐as she was transported onto the bridge of <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've been awaiting your arrival, commander. Sorry for interrupting your leisure time."</p>
<p class="null-p">A woman wearing a <Ratatoskr>uniform saluted to her. This person was one of the crew members of <Ratatoskr>, nicknamed <Nail Knocker>Shiizaki. Although <Fraxinus>'s workload had decreased since the disappearance of Spirits, the minimal amount of crew members rotated shifts onboard the bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing. Compared to that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, please over here."</p>
<p class="null-p">After giving her bag to Shiizaki for safekeeping, Kotori headed for the captain's seat. Maria was already waiting there on the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐So, what is the reaction that has caught your attention, Maria?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria briefly replied as she turned to the main monitor on the bridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then as if to match this‐‐although since Maria had control over the entire ship, this was merely making the equivalent of making minor adjustments‐‐numbers and graphs were on display on the monitor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori narrowed her eyes while reclining on the captain's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The numerical values and figures on display showed the fluctuations of observed Spacequakes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Usually, this would be used to predict future Spacequakes. Now that the Spirit of Origin has disappeared, no more Spacequakes have occurred since. However, it seemed that Maria continued her observations regardless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the top of the data, Kotori raised her brow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite it being tiny‐‐a suspected Spacequake response had been observed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, you can also see the changes in value over the past few weeks. Nonetheless, since the change was only a slight fluctuation, we assumed it was just machine error, but‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori asked that, Maria held her hand over the monitor. ……Holding up her hand likely wasn't necessarily, but Maria seemed to want to draw attention to that motion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like that, the monitor had changed into another screen. Moreover, it wasn't just an urban map of Tenguu City. It was a world map centered on the Japanese archipelago.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also, something resembling huge red ripples was drawn onto the map.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori thought it was a joke for a moment, but then soon immediately realized. ‐‐The red ripples devouring the world was the range of the observations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! No way, it's that wide?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. As if‐‐the world is pulsating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Maria's words caused Kotori's expression to turn grim.</p>
<p class="null-p">It could be said to be a very weak response. Someone on the level of AST would have great difficulty capturing this.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when the observational range includes not only Japan, but also the Eurasian Continent, the Pacific Ocean, Australia, and to the west coast of the United States, it would be difficult to leave this matter alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Maria, please continue to observe. Not only for spacequake fluctuations, but also investigate any Reiha responses and Maryoku responses…… "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. ‐‐I will let Units 2 through 5 prepare for work after they return from their part time job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, thank‐‐wait, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori was about to nod, but then twisted her head at those peculiar words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maria, what did you just say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Ah, it's units 2 through 5. You don't know how many terminals I have?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, did you want to know about letting multiple individuals being run by the same AI? Indeed, all of those terminal bodies are run by me, but each one is equipped with an auxiliary computing device. Of course, their calculation device can't be compared to that of <Fraxinus>. But if done in parallel, a corresponding result would be expected. Although I am the type to pay attention to appearance, I won't call upon these terminal bodies just for the sake of looking hard at work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm not asking about that. What is that part time job?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori asked that question while sweaty, Maria turned to look away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"One year after the disappearance of the Spirit of Origin, there is no longer the danger of Spacequakes and backflow of Reiryoku. But even if I am an AI, I am still a maiden. There are many things that I want. Clothes, accessories, cosmetics……wax for the ship's exterior, supercomputers for calculation, oil and gas bombs for emergency use. ……If I want to buy these, I need to work to earn money."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't you add something strange in the second half!? And isn't it dangerous to do part time work with that highly classified body!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, don't worry about that. I'm working at a place that won't bother <Ratatoskr>. There's no scrutiny for personal information. Well, it is the sort of place where I really wouldn't want work there if I didn't have to……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, where exactly are you working!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Given this suspicious description, Kotori couldn't help but scream.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Uhh……if I remember correctly, it should be room 1801."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou whispered as he entered the number, which he recalled from his memories, onto the terminal screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after the sound of the doorbell……a familiar voice came out from the microphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hurry‐‐up‐‐and‐‐come up……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as those words fell, the entrance to the apartment opened. Shidou regripped his bag as he walked into the corridor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he headed for the elevator to arrive at the desired floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Where Shidou was visiting now was not the mansion next to the Itsuka residence, but rather a high-rise apartment in the city. Former Spirit and manga artist‐‐the residence and work studio of Honjou Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">The progress of the manuscript had reached a dangerous and unprecedented level. She had called Shidou just now while sobbing that to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite that low-brow acting, Shidou didn't laugh. After all, since he wasn't particularly busy right now, he decided to respond to Nia's request for help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, if it was too much, she should hire more assistants."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou glanced at the ingredients he had bought along the way as he muttered to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">These days Nia seemed to be only eating cup noodles. She complained to him that she wanted a decent meal. Despite buying ingredients, there was likely too many things Nia would likely order.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Likely, what would be ideal was something storable and could be eaten for a while even after cooking was done.</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking about that, Shidou arrived at his destination. He reached to ring the doorbell.</p>
<p class="null-p">That moment, as if realizing he was here, the door opened with a slam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're finally here Boy! I've been waiting so loooooong……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that manner, Nia weakly smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a 20 year old woman who was wearing spectacle. She wore a jersey that abandoned everything except functionality, resembling an unfashionable Japanese robe. Despite wearing a thin glove for her dominant hand, the portions covering index finger, middle finger, and thumb were all exposed and the sides of her hands were black and dirty. Her bangs were held back by a hair band. Furthermore, there was something substituting for a cooling sheet on her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">When all put together, she looked like a ghastly ghost prepared to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You……really look terrible……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is terrible. I've been serialized for so long that this scene of carnage appears‐‐uhh, once every two months."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The frequency is that high!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou raised his voice, Nia let out a "hehe" laugh……while smiling and shrugging.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, anyway, you've saved me by coming here. I haven't been motivated to eat anything but instant recently. Can I ask that you make breakfast for the time being?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, um."</p>
<p class="null-p">The current time was 1:00 PM. It was far too late for breakfast, but Shidou couldn't even ridicule her. Likely, she hasn't eaten anything this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I bought the ingredients, so I need to borrow the kitchen. Do you have basic kitchenware?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, of course over there. It's good as new."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should at least use them a little……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou, with sweat dripping from his forehead, walked through the hallway with mountains of cardboard boxes and books piling up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along the way, Shidou stopped his feet. The reason was simple. It was because there were signs of other people in Nia's studio.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Background of page five is complete."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The coloring is done here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here is the data for you two. Merge and double check."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐And so on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Girls with the exact same appearance were sitting on the desk arranged in the workplace and working on a tablet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maria, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Faced by this unexpected situation, Shidou widened his eyes. That's right. These were the interface bodies of the <Fraxinus>AI Maria.</p>
<p class="null-p">The working Marias turned their eyes to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good afternoon. It looks like Shidou was also called here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Temporary part time job. I'm not willing to work in a poor work environment, but I want money that I can use freely."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Incidentally, the special hourly wage is 20,000 yen per person. But Nia's standard for wages is miscellaneous when she's stuck, so I think it's better for Shidou to ask for payment right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">A Maria told him as she shrugged her shoulders and returned back to work. Nia also helplessly shrugged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really short on manpower…..it was difficult for me to grab her after she started going to junior high……well, even though she has a poisonous mouth, she's meticulous at work and good at the finishing touches.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Shidou noticed something.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was another person sitting beside the table where the Marias were sitting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her light colored blond hair and black jersey were in a mess. ‐‐There was no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The former DEM Wizard and current <Ratatoskr>staff member‐‐Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha……ha……how about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking lost for breath, Ellen displayed a piece of paper. For some reason, she was the only one doing analog work.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia touched her chin while staring at Ellen's work‐‐then whacking Ellen's forehead with a paper fan on the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wrong!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch……! W-What are you doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing!? You can't add shading, you can't add tones, and as a bonus you're an idiot with machines, so I left you with only erasing. Why can't you even do that properly!? The broken lines are still visible here. Elechi's physical strength is too weak! How do you think you can be a professional manga artist like this!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't even want to be a professional……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! Redo it immediately! With more weight in strength and love this time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nugugugugu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen let out a frustrated groan as she returned back to work. Nia muttered out a "really……" as she tossed the paper fan over her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why is Ellen……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Ah, she was dispatched after I said there wasn't enough manpower as you can see. At first, I was Spartan because of my painful past. Or so I had thought. But seeing her be this useless is making my heart snap!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Nia sighed, Maria raised her voice to add a supplement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Incidentally, Ellen is a <Ratatoskr>staff member, so she has a fixed salary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hahaha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou gave a powerless laugh, a figure appeared behind Nia, stealing the paper fan and slapping her head with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch? W-What are you doing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Nia was clutching her head, the figure that appeared behind her‐‐another Maria (who for some reason was wearing black-rimmed glasses and an armband that said Production Director) helplessly sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's my line. Are you in any position to say that to Ellen? Hurry up and go back to drawing the main character."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia scratched her head as she retuned back to the workbench with her ink bottle and pen. It looked like Nia was also doing hand-drawn work. Speaking of which, while the finishing touches have gradually transitioned to digital, outlines and rough drafts were still done by hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So Shidou, I'll leave the cooking to you. Nia, Ellen, Shidou, and also us four, that makes a total of seven."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Got it, just wait a little bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, having this many people worked with this amount of ingredients. Shidou nodded as he walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, let me show off my skills."</p>
<p class="null-p">After washing his hands, Shidou started cooking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having heard that it would be a battlefield in advance, he decided that the menu would be sandwiches. This way, they could enjoy the flavors of various fillings while also still working.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou sliced the freshly baked bread he had bought along the way here and added in the various ingredients one by one. Ham, eggs, cheese, and tuna sandwich, ample roast beef garnished with</p>
<p class="null-p">wasabi sauce, a cutlet sandwich with tingly mustard sauce, a fruit sandwich interposed with strawberries and fresh cream, everything was all laid out in preparation for the meal.</p>
<p class="null-p">About thirty minutes later, in the center of a plain white plate, brightly-sliced, sandwich-shaped flowers bloomed in size.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, dig in everyone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">":……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to Shidou's voice, a fiery glance was directed from the workshop. Well, it mainly came from Nia and Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou walked to them with a wry smile as he set down the sandwich plates.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yahho, itadakimasu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A decent meal for the first time in 12 hours……"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that respectively, Nia and Ellen both reached out for a sandwich. Nia lightly breathed out a "delicious!" (mental image), as Ellen was saying "Uu, uuu" with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, you two have no decency."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how hungry, a meal should be done elegantly."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Marias wiped their hands with a sanitizing sheet before starting to eat the sandwiches. He had heard that Maria's internal combustion engine could use organic matter as fuel, so she was able to eat just like a normal human being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……well, I'm glad that you guys can eat so happily."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou picked up and took a bite out of the roast beef sandwich. The rich taste of the meat and the spiciness of the wasabi gave way to an exquisite harmony. While singing one's own praises, it was quite the taste.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuhi……I've come back to life. It's natural, but you've got to eat. Humans don't live to work, they work to live. It would be awful to get that wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia, who after recovering some of her composure as her stomach was swelling, began talking as if realizing something. However, since the Maria in charge of production began started to vigorously waving her fan, Nia quickly corrected her posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she dipped her pen in the ink bottle and continued drawing in a familiar tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, but I really was saved. Boy's meals always seem to be a blessing from God."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, you're exaggerating too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, I'm serious. ……Ah, really, Boy. Are you serious about finding a job? You'll be responsible full time just for the cooking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't talk crazy. Won't I be starting college next month?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Nia drew a line with profound movements. She said "that's right" as she pointed the pen at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's good to go to college, but is there something you want to do in the future? What sort of person do you want to be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being suddenly asked that, Shidou widened his eyes. Nia narrowed her eyes behind her glasses as she continued her speech.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow going to school for four years, somehow finding a career, somehow climbing up the corporate ladder……well, that may lead to a happy life. If there's no such goal or the goals and work are equal, wouldn't work just be for getting enough food to eat? If it's like this, wouldn't it be good to work for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've set up a company for tax purposes, so I can treat you as a full time employee. Salary can be doubled or tripled. Of course, there are bonuses & salary increases. ‐‐Somehow, I feel that you'll refusal with the usual flow of my invitation. Think calmly, the salary is good, commuting is easy, and you can utilize your skills. There's also a beautiful boss. I think it would be a pretty good job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Nia had said, Shidou fell silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou didn't find Nia's words unreasonable.</p>
<p class="null-p">As of now, he was 18 years old. At the age of 18, Shidou had decided to go to college. But at this age, there were quite of few people who decided to already begin working. He had reached the age where men could get married, obtain a driver's license, and even have the right to vote.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he wasn't quite an adult yet, it could be said that he was at the boundary line for adulthood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was still just a high school student before and never took Nia's joking tone seriously. But after graduating from college, his chance of finding a company with better conditions than Nia's offer would be low.</p>
<p class="null-p">……No, that wasn't important. Shidou's heart had been capture by what Nia said before.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Do you have anything you want to do in the future or something you want to be?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a question Shidou had been deeply asking himself but couldn't answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Fumu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou quickly thought about it, but Nia sighed while holding her chin. It seemed like she had seen through his struggle just from his response.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression seemed calm but also a bit awkward. It was like she was thinking "Did I say a little too much……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou blankly let out his voice. The things he wanted to do. What he wanted to be. A future goal that was different from the vague dreams of childhood. What he wanted to achieved even if it meant risking his life. That was‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the paper fan wacked Nia's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Your hands have stopped moving, Nia. Please work hard before trying to say something grand. There's only six hours left until the deadline."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Maria, who was in charge of production, glanced at her with a sharp look. Then, she turned to look at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be fooled Shidou. Even though she says that you'll only be responsible for cooking, I can already see her giving you all sorts of chores. Indeed, the income may be good, but working hours aren't fixed and it's natural to work overtime during holidays. And although you may ignore this, who are you calling a beautiful boss?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh‐‐what's wrong with that‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia pouted in dissatisfaction, but her hands were still smoothly working out of fear from the intimidation of Maria's paper fan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, please leave persuading to after leaving this battlefield. ‐‐Ah, and Ellen. How long have you been crying? Hurry up and return back to work." Maria dropped her instructions as she turned back to face Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for your efforts Shidou. You've been a great help. Can I pay you on a later day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, um……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Shidou nodded to what Maria had said, he looked at the workplace again as he creaked and scratched his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, since it's a boat I've already boarded, I'll help you until the very end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Really, Boy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing that, Nia raised her face and turned to him with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Six hours after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's finally‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐oveeeeeeeeeer‐‐‐‐‐‐‐!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia's cry resonated throughout the studio as sparse applause was scattered around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaaah……it was really dangerous this time, but luckily I managed to catch up……thank you so much everyone……"</p>
<p class="null-p">While taking, Nia removed her cooling sheet and her hairband. Her bangs were rolled up like bed hair from being pressed down for so long.</p>
<p class="null-p">"All in all, everyone has worked very hard. But, be careful to not expect the same schedule working next time just because it ended well now. After all, I feel writers tend to always overestimate when they can exert their full strength,"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Maria in charge of production sighed as she took off her glasses and armband. Nia forcefully prostrated herself as her gestures gave the impression of a "hehe!" sound. ……Somehow, Shidou thought that a repeat of this situation was inevitable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria must have had the same idea as she helplessly shrugged. However, she knew it would be useless to say anything to the current Nia, who was relieved of tension from having the manuscript finished. So, she decided to not say anything further as she began to pack up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then we shall leave first. There are also other jobs."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Maria said that, Nia widened her eyes in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? Who needs help!? Is there anyone that's in more danger than my manuscript!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't tell if you're serious or just joking around, but I'm not a professional assistant. It's the usual work for <Ratatoskr>."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Maria who was in charge of production said while keeping one eye open. Nia replied with</p>
<p class="null-p">"well, that sounds about right" while sticking out her tongue and closing one of her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're so lacking in manners."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Four interface bodies, 29 hours of unrestraint work, the total comes up to 232,000 yen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please transfer the money to the account by the end of the month."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? That much!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia's eyes opened in alarm as she raised her fingers to calculate. After calculating the results, Nia's face jerked as she smiled bitterly. …… Apparently, she had hurriedly decided the hourly wage while under the tension from the deadline.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……W-Well it can't be helped. The manuscript fees mean I'll be completely in the red, but at least I didn't leave a hole in the serialization….."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Nia's tone suggested that she was trying to convince herself, the Marias took their leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately afterwards, it was Ellen's turn to stand up staggeringly with a ghostly expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bed……where is my bed……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ellen, while mumbling to herself and walking from the workroom to take a nap, immediately collapsed down as the sounds of sleeping were heard. …… It seemed like her limit had been reached a long time ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ah……looks like she won't be waking up for a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia scratched her head as she covered Ellen with a blanket and returned back to the workplace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Robot girl escapes and Elechi falls down……fumu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if her messy bangs marked being struck by a flash of inspiration, Nia turned her eyes to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Hey Boy, do you still have time after this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Ah, I'm okay, is there still something that needs to be done?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? No, I just thought a little celebration is in order for finishing so much work."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Nia shrugged her shoulders. Indeed, if Shidou left now, she would return back to drinking alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……then I'll accompany you. But even if you want to celebrate, there are no more ingredients left to use. The refrigerator in Nia's house only has liquor so I'll have to go shopping."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, um, that's right……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, Nia was placing her hand against her chin while thinking up of something. Then, after acquiring an idea, she turned her attention back to Shidou again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Boy, sorry but can you wait for me at the front of the apartment? I'll be right there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, that's fine but why so suddenly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really! Does Boy want to peek at Onee-san changing clothes? Boy is too perverted!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Nia twisted her body while holding onto her own shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, Nia's jersey had noticeable ink marks. The feeling of incongruity had long since faded since he was used to her looking like that, but it would be particularly daring to go outside while dressed like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I'll head out first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un, wait just a moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia waved good-bye for now. Shidou returned the gesture as he changed shoes and left Nia's apartment. Continuing down the elevator to arrive at the first floor, he began waiting in front of the building.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like this, he didn't even know how long he waited.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning his head, he heard the sound of an engine coming from somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was soon revealed. A crimson convertible arrived from the apartment's underground parking lot and stopped right in front of Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">A rounded but sharp model with a prominent left steering wheel, the engine sound was clearly different from a normal passenger car. It was so powerful that even Shidou, who knew nothing about cars, could tell it was a luxurious car in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">But none of this was what surprised Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the familiar face standing in the driver's seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Boy, I've kept you waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Nia!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Holding the steering wheel with one hand and blowing an exaggerated kiss, it was the same Nia who had the image of wearing a worn out jersey.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was now wearing a simple but stunning evening dress with a pair of large sunglasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to the manga artist he was just with before, the change was quite the transformation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why are you dressed like that Nia……and this car……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Nia expressed a nihilistic smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you heard the story, Boy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If a manga artist produces a big hit, the publisher will ask them to buy some valuables like a house or car."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why is it like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This way, if the artists don't continue drawing, they won't be able to pay taxes next year. So we can't afford to be lazy at work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-So it's like that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt like he just learned something he shouldn't have known. Shidou smiled bitterly and scratched his face at this information.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's also useful in situations like this. Come on Boy, it's a rare opportunity. I'll drive you for a night tour."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia invited him with a bewitching gesture. As he was left at a loss, Shidou was compelled to sit in the passenger seat because of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, let's go Boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia nodded with satisfaction, smiling while turning to the front. Obviously there was no internal change, but Shidou thought that her face seen from the side looked cool.</p>
<p class="null-p">……But.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh……uh. How do I use the clutch again? It's because I've only been driving automatic lately……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The magic was quickly released. Nia looked confused at her hands and feet while scratching her head. ……Suddenly, Shidou felt anxious at being in the front passenger seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it looked like she finally remembered the driving method. Nia reorganized herself by clearing her throat with a cough.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, this time we'll really head out. Did you fasten your seatbelt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Boy, let me teach you something good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's hard to see the road when you're wearing sunglasses at night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take them off immediately!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted as he involuntarily took away Nia's sunglasses. For someone who was still getting use to driving, wearing something like that would be simply suicide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, my charm point!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no such charm! Safety first!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou yelled, Nia shrugged her shoulders as if giving up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes……so give them back."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, after taking the sunglasses from Shidou's hands, she folded them and hung them by the chest portion of her dress. Shidou was instinctively struck by the adult gesture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Oh!? Did Boy's heart skip a beat? It skipped a beat right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia asked with a smug smile. It felt like she had changed back to her usual self in the blink of an eye. Shidou let out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……If you didn't ruin the atmosphere just like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, that's awful. Forget that, I'll recover it from now on. Let's go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as that voice fell, Nia stepped on the pedal in full throttle. With the loud exhaust sound and violet friction coming from the tires, the car quickly started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nuo……! D-Don't speed up so quickly Nia!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, I know!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that in a tone as if not knowing anything, Nia controlled the wheel. Rather than actual driving, these flashy movements looked like it had come from an electronic racing game in a game center or something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, the car passed the residential area and entered the main street. However, Nia didn't show any gestures of stopping to look for a store.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows while confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Nia, how far are you planning on going? I think a nearby supermarket is enough to buy……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Who says we were going out shopping?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou couldn't help but raise his voice, Nia's sports car continued to traverse through the road, passing through the intersection and entering the highway.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Nia?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyaha! Goodbye legal speed limit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia shouted with delight as she stepped on the gas pedal with even more force than before. As the engine raised a whisper of rejoice, the back of the car accelerated sharply after a slight shake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nyahahahahaha! How about it Boy! Doesn't this feel good!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……! Fool, you……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The racing car on the highway at night was just like a red bullet. The wind blew against the convertible without a roof, violently pushing back Nia and Shidou's hair. Streetlights lined up in regular intervals passed through in a blur from both sides of Shidou's vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……So."</p>
<p class="null-p">About 30 minutes later.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou clutched his head as he asked Nia who was sitting on the opposite seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did this happen again……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou asked while looking around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Nia were now seated in a French restaurant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moreover, this was not an ordinary restaurant. The lobby was filled with extravagant lighting.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the glass walls, the night view of the starry sky could be seen. The BGM resounded so casually to the extent that it wouldn't interfere with the meal. Looking closer, it was a live performance.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a nutshell, this was a high-end restaurant that high school students like Shidou would rarely partake in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Being alone with Boy, I just wanted to be extravagant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't this a bit too extravagant? Wasn't the price you just ordered more expensive than one month of my food expenses……!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you don't have to worry about money. My treat♡, of course rest assured your salary today will also be paid for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not asking about that……!</p>
<p class="null-p">All of the guests in their surroundings were dressed in more than adequate formal attire. Shidou glanced at his own outfit as cold sweat ran down his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is it okay for me to be dressed so normally?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is fine, it is fine. There is a dress code, but you won't be refused unless you're wearing sandals or shorts."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia, who had changed outfits herself, happily laughed. ……Although Shidou felt a little uncomfortable from Nia's words, if she had worn that dirty jersey from before, they would have surely been refused entry into the store.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was thinking this over, a waiter arrived at their table with a soft smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Here is your Krug Clos du Mesnil."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while saying that, the waiter placed a glass on the table and began pouring a foamy platinum colored liquid into it. Despite not knowing what Nia had ordered, it seemed to be some sort of champagne.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here is your ginger ale."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the waiter placed a glass in front of Shidou and poured the soda into the glass.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now Boy, cheers."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia raised her glass.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh…...cheers."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou picked up his ginger ale and gently let it touch the edges of Nia's glass.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia smiled as she lightly shook the glass. The liquid in the glass shined brightly from the indirect lighting. Nia then took a sip and then exhaled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Un, it tastes good. The fragrance is gorgeous and perfect."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The extremely elegant manner caught Shidou off guard for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">How could he describe it, it was a strange sensation. Shidou couldn't combine the image of the usual decadent person with the lady standing in front of him. Incidentally, including the Nia who was just driving earlier,</p>
<p class="null-p">or‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, it could be a side of Nia that he didn't know about. Recognizing this again, Shidou fell silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Shidou like this, Nia lightly lifted up her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong Boy? Fascinated by your Onee-san's charm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's not it……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou tried to hide this with a cough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia laughed in her usual "Ehehe!" manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, what is it? Boy must have his worries right now, but it surprisingly easy to become adult.</p>
<p class="null-p">You can drink when you're in a bad mood or when you're happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This isn't about drinking……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou smiled bitterly at Nia's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">But after a beat, Shidou raised his eyebrows. ‐‐Did Nia see that he was worried about his future and brought him here for consultation?</p>
<p class="null-p">Before while trying to persuade Shidou, Nia must have seen through his confusion. Although that incident game to an end thanks to Maria, Nia didn't miss sensing his hesitation at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, this assumption was a bit too much no matter how he tried to phrase it. But, being unconstrained in behavior and movement did feel in line with Nia. Thinking of this, Shidou smiled again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey, Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a few seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou spoke while slightly raising his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What's wrong Boy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing serious…...I just wanted to ask you when you thought to become a manga artist."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I was aiming to be a manga artist……huh. How old was I? I've been reading manga forever so it just felt natural. Wasn't the first time when I entered elementary school and drew something cartoonish in my notebook? By that moment, I felt that my future dream was to be a manga artist. Well, the first time I got an award was during the first year of high school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-So early……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou couldn't hide his surprise. Nia had made her debut while being two years younger than himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was perhaps easy to forget due to usually seeing her in a messy state, but Nia's penname Souji Honjou was a big name in the industry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nia really is amazing……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Shidou's expression, Nia gently poked Shidou's face with a kind look of understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about you Boy? ‐‐Have you decided on your future goals? Or have you decided in your heart that you can finally tell others about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's heartbeat speed upon hearing what Nia had said. After a short while, Shidou raised his lowered head and stared directly into Nia's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Arya. Bingo?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Why do you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, even if you ask me, it's hard to answer. It's intuition. From the perspective of the previous conversation, saying stuff like 'it's amazing I've set my goals while so young', 'it's amazing I've achieved them so early'. And also, how to say it‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia continued on while a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone has a dream that's embarrassing to say. However, if you put those dreams into words and tell others, then you bear some responsibility for those words‐‐don't you feel it's just like that? More specifically, there's the hint of making a firm resolution? After all, I've been on the same road before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia lowered her eyes while sighing. Shidou felt his heartbeat grow more intense again. ‐‐As if pushed by some invisible force.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia fell silent again after saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However she was still looking at Shidou with sympathetic eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps waiting, for when Shidou's determination settles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou took a deep breath and said while looking directly back at Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, I still don't know what will happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would like to enter Asgard Electronics after graduating from college, <Ratatoskr>to be more precise. ‐‐I think that's the only place where research on Spirits can be performed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's it‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Shidou's resolution, Nia was neither surprised nor smiling as she quietly replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if she realized the full intentions behind Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐To meet her again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia looked directly at Shidou while asking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirits are a secret and no longer exist. He wanted to study such a thing. It was natural to think about the purpose behind this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, this was a dangerous thought. He had been urged to stop just the other day by Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the worst scenario, this strange and mysterious peaceful life may shatter and fall apart again.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, Shidou couldn't just easily nod. But looking at Nia's honest face, he couldn't tell her a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………, ……Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a moment of hesitation, Shidou replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia briefly responded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not good. I think that's the best place for Boy. But for me, this is like being rejected by an excellent assistant candidate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou bitterly smiled, Nia shook her glass while slightly loosening her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, things in the future, things about you, there are times where there's no choice but to think it over, but troubles and joy come mutually. ‐‐For Boy who is worried enough; only in a harsh environment are the fruits sweeter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nia‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">To those words, Shidou let out a thin sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………You really are so cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What? Can you say it again? Nia-chan couldn't hear that just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia said while leaning forward. She definitely had heard it. Shidou smiled again while replying with a simple "no."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh, Boy is too stingy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia complained and pouted, chugging down the remaining champagne in the glass.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, delicious! Having said that, wait two more years Boy and come drink with me! The first drink has to be with me! Won't I guarantee you the best liquor?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……I don't want to drink too high quality alcohol for the first time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about? The first time is the most important! If you drink something that doesn't fit, you may end up hating it. Then how can you be in good spirits during the evening?</p>
<p class="null-p">Okay, okay, leave everything to your Onee-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia raised her empty glass to Shidou with a serious look. Shidou gave up resisting as he helplessly raised his hands up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, I know. I'll leave it to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright! Boy's first experience appointment is complete! Promise me you won't be snatched away by another woman in a circle?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What weird things are you saying now……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou helplessly smiled‐‐but just then, he noticed a problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Say Nia, didn't we arrive here by car today……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Yes, in my favorite machine, the Scarlet Phoenix."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia nodded in response to the question. ……Although the name of the vehicle was concerning, there were more pressing matters right now. He raised his voice while hitting the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are drinking so normally!? It was so natural that I didn't even realize it! How are we supposed to get back home now!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou shouted, Nia let out an "ah", widening her eyes and smiling as if trying to dodge the issue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Want to book a room?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked cool for less than a minute before reverting back. Shidou let out a heavy sigh as he decided to ask <Ratatoskr>to send a driver for help.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Nighttime</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐, ‐‐, ‐‐‐‐ "</p>
<p class="null-p">While lying in a remote area covered in darkness, Honjou Nia was repeatedly gasping, struggling to breathe.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reflecting on the jet-black darkness, there was single beam of moonlight on that spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">No‐‐to if asked to describe it more accurately.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the end of Nia's field of vision, the moonlight was shining down on the shadows of a beast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You came……this is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia's throat squeezed as she let out a hoarse voice. At the same time she coughed violently from an ache coming from both her abdomen and chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">A moisten whimper. The burning sensation of vomiting was coming from the back of her throat as something was spilling from edge of her cavity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even in this darkness, she could easily tell that this was blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Vision growing blurry, limbs feeling numb, even the pain nurturing her consciousness was gradually fading away.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Ah, so this is what death feels like. If I had known this earlier I could have drawn that scene in the 19th volume more impressively‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">With her thoughts blurry, such a worthless thought was still spinning around. However, if this was her last thoughts, it did feel appropriate. Nia unintentionally laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐A, a‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ Beast</p>
<p class="null-p">The beast that had delivered some sort of fatal wound to Nia was slowly raising its voice while drawing closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strangely, there was no fear or anger. There were regrets and questions‐‐‐‐after all, this happening was too pitiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Forgive me…..I guess……this is it……for me……"</p>
<p class="null-p">With those last words, Nia finally lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3: Tokisaki Kurumi</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐If one experience strong tastes, one will eventually grow accustomed to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐If one continues to suffer severe pain, one will eventually come to be desensitized to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same is true for the human heart as it gains resistance from the environment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strong despair, intense sorrow, even the anger scorching the body will gradually grow milder.</p>
<p class="null-p">To say it positively, this is adaptation. To put it negatively, this means being worn out. It must be a function for people to live as people. Emotions that are too strong tend to gouge out, wear down, and scorch the heart. And then it just becomes a hindrance towards survival.</p>
<p class="null-p">And eventually people forget. Leaving behind the bitter past, sad memories, and the painful journey traveled.</p>
<p class="null-p">A heart full of despair will lose its true form and then merely be left as recorded information. But fresh events will eventually overwrite that information. Time is kinder than anything else and will eventually place a lid on that wound‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">But. Alas, but.</p>
<p class="null-p">This despair, sadness, and anger. What should a person suffering from this do to forget all of these negative emotions?</p>
<p class="null-p">The answer is clear. ‐‐There is no choice but to continue to despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">A life mission where she wagered her existence to accomplish, and doing so meant to endlessly burn in negative sentiments.</p>
<p class="null-p">For years and years, I have continued to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only by doing so, I could walk my own path.</p>
<p class="null-p">But with this suddenly acquired peace, I now think to myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despair beyond the tolerance of an ordinary person, a Spirit whose heart continued to burn in the hearth, a Spirit that had lost her power.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Can my past deeds really be called being human?</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">By the end of March, the coldness of winter had subsided and the surroundings atmosphere was gradually filled by springtime weather.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sprouts on the ground, flowers buds nearby trees, and also pollen mixed into the wind, walking down the road even the people were dressed more refreshingly than the previous weeks. Well, there were a few outliners that wore glasses and masks even more now than they did during wintertime.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking in the warm sunlight bathing his entire body, Shidou greatly stretched.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was now on a street that was a ten minute walk from the Itsuka residence. It was a quiet area just on the dividing line between the residential area and the suburbs.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the progression of each step, the amount of people grew scarce as they were replaced by an increase of trees and flowers. This was the ideal place to take a walk.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that being said, Shidou was not lured by the spring breeze or trying to walk to curb a lack of daily exercise.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a simple reason, Shidou had come to visit a person living nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Here it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silently muttering, he stopped in front of a house.</p>
<p class="null-p">A single old-fashioned isolated house surrounded by a tall fence. Looking up, there was ivy creeping on the surface of the iron door. To spin it positively, it was majestic. To say it negatively, it was the only thing that gave a chilly haunted house vibe underneath the warm sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the side of the door there was a metal nameplate labeled TOKISAKI. Although it should have been relatively new, it was colored by fine scratches and rust either from the occupant's own interest or being exposed to a harsh environment for the past year. It seemed to match the atmosphere of the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐That's right. Tokisaki Kurumi. The girl who was once called the Worst Spirit was the owner of this house.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the conflict ended one year ago, <Ratatoskr>tried to prepare a room for her in the mansion next to the Itsuka residence, but Kurumi refused and began living in this western house. It seemed that this was one of the strongholds Kurumi had previously owned.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Ratatoskr>wanted to move her into a residence under their organization. But since the wishes of the Spirit were prioritized, her residence was decided without putting much of a fight. ‐‐Well, there was more possibility of a dispute if she had retained the power of the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, since last year, Kurumi has lived alone in this house.</p>
<p class="null-p">She remained registered at school as a student and since the Itsuka residence was within walking distance, she occasionally came over to have dinner with everyone. However, since this depended on Kurumi's mood, she would often come less frequently than everyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">So Shidou would go check up on her every now and then, bringing along</p>
<p class="null-p">food when he has cooked too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today's gift was beef stew with potatoes and sesame spinach. Well, since Kurumi was also a master at cooking, he didn't have to worry about her starving like Nia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then."</p>
<p class="null-p">After whispering to himself, Shidou pressed on the doorbell set up on the wall.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In her study room, Tokisaki Kurumi was silently immersing herself in a book.</p>
<p class="null-p">The room should have been originally 20 tatami mats. However, it felt much narrower due to being squeezed in space by the bookshelves lined up against the wall and the mountains of books and documents piled up in front of it. Despite it still being daytime, a stack of books on the east side near a window was blocking the sun. So she was still using electrical lighting while turning the pages of the book.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes followed the text as she wrote down the important information in her notebook. At the same time, her imagination leaped up as she formulated the various expressions and wording used.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐How much time has passed? The alarm from the smartphone in her hands rang, causing her shoulders to slightly shake.</p>
<p class="null-p">A schedule notification was displayed on the screen. Apparently, it seemed that the appointed time had arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ara, ara. It's already that time."</p>
<p class="null-p">While quietly saying that, Kurumi stretched her back forward as if preparing to lie on a table.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her stiff neck and shoulders somewhat ached.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same moment her concentration faltered, the fatigue and hunger she had been ignoring until now suddenly reappeared. Kurumi let out a deep sigh while rubbing her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Now, it's time to start preparing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally she would stay a little longer here, but there was an appointment today that needed her to go out. She talked to herself as she exited the door of the study room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Books were piled randomly on the way to the door. The road was like a sports maze, but Kurumi was already well familiar with the route from repeated travels. She walked briskly to the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Kurumi stopped her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. It was because she had seen her own reflection through the glass window.</p>
<p class="null-p">A petite girl dressed in black attire. Lustrous black hair with the same color as a crow's feathers, a white porcelain face, and in the center there were a pair of eyes of the same color staring at herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing those features, Kurumi walked up to the glass window.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she reached out with her fingertips to stroke the reflection of her left eye on the glass.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought I would get used to it, but it still feels a little uncomfortable. ‐‐It's strange. There were times where I thought it was even a cursed symbol."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a complicated feeling. Kurumi sighed and lowered her eyes, looking away as she regained focus to return to her original route.</p>
<p class="null-p">Going through the hallway and up the stairs to the bedroom, she entered a walk-in closet and chose an appropriate outfit from a row of clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……this one should do."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi skillfully changed into a Gothic Lolita-style dress. Turning around in front of the mirror, the frills of the skirt fluttered and sketched a beautiful trajectory.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Ara."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi slightly raised her eyebrows. The moment she turned, something appeared at the edge of her vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">On top of the cosmetic shelf in the corner of the room, there was a squareshaped confectionary jar that could be used to exchange gifts.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, what contained inside were neither biscuits nor any other snacks.</p>
<p class="null-p">A refined lady like Kurumi wouldn't eat confectionary goods in her bedroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I feel nostalgic, we."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's expression relaxed as she open the lid of the jar.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐What was contained were four different types of eyepatches.</p>
<p class="null-p">One of them was a white eyepatch for medical use. One of them was a bandage oozing with bloodstains. One of them was a heart-shaped eyepatch decorated with frills. And the last one was an eyepatch shaped like the guard of a sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">And under them were rose ornaments for hair, cross accessories, ribbons with laces, and braids with bells.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, these were the accessories wore by Kurumi's clones when she had the power of the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">One year ago, when the power of the Spirits disappeared from the world, the clones of Kurumi created from <Zafkiel>also disappeared with that power.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, these eyepatch accessories were the equivalent of their mementos.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the clothes knitted through reiryoku‐‐Astral Dresses, had disappeared along with them. But apparently some individuals found it tiresome to make alterations to their Astral Dress and bought accessories based on their own preferences.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today's destination did share a connection to them. Kurumi reached into the jar and picked up the medical eyepatch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Would we also like to go together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She tied the eyepatch onto her left eye as a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking up at the mirror, it felt like an illusion of her past self clone being resurrected on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara, it's normal after all for us to look alike."</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, Kurumi couldn't help but find this amusing and laugh about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As for the other eyepatches‐‐it can't be helped not putting them on."</p>
<p class="null-p">If both eyes were covered, nothing could be seen. Kurumi wrapped the bandage around her hands and attached the heart and sword guard eyepatches onto her clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……tie it here and the rest……"</p>
<p class="null-p">While doing this, the enjoyment gradually grew more and more fun. She put on the remaining hair ornaments and accessories and even took out the frilly parasol standing in the closet. Then, she decided to take a pose in front of the mirror.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fumu‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Not too shabby.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi assumed the next pose with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Raising the hem of her skirt with both hands to show respect, closing the parasol and holding in front like a gentlemen's walking stick, a pose showing off her beautiful neck, and many more‐‐the poses were seen in various angles. She decided to take photos of her favorite pose with her smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, how much time had passed?</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the photos she took, Kurumi suddenly calmed down.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like another person had possessed her from above. Within her chest, a different emotion soon came to the surface.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐An eyepatch for medical use. Well, when she still had her Reiryoku, it wasn't meaningless since her left eye had changed in appearance. But why was she wearing an eyepatch now when not injured?</p>
<p class="null-p">The same goes for the other accessories. Why did she have bandages without even having a scratch? Why was she carrying a cross without being a devote Christian? Thinking it over, what was the purpose of a skull ring? There wasn't any reason to carry a parasol indoors and the sword guard eyepatch didn't make any sense either.</p>
<p class="null-p">All in all, she suddenly became embarrassed by her outfit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………………Need to change out of this."</p>
<p class="null-p">After looking at herself in the mirror for a moment, Kurumi whispered to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't understand why she was so excited a few minutes ago. Perhaps it was due to her clones' lingering sentiments for the eyepatches and accessories.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, it was good that she was at home. If someone was watching this, Kurumi would need to figure out a way to dispose of the corpse so that this would never get out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi tried closing the parasol while letting out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Hey, Kurumi, are you there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice came from behind at the same moment the sound of the door was heard opening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that instant, their eyes met as Shidou opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, after a brief pause.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa‐‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa‐‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Two screams echoed in the Tokisaki residence.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was an awkward silence in the Tokisaki residence's living room. The tick tock sound coming from the clock could loudly be heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was unavoidable. Shidou sighed lightly while recalling the tragedy that had just occurred.</p>
<p class="null-p">……No, of course this wasn't intentional on Shidou's part. He rang the doorbell and no one responded. And since the door was open, he entered the house to see if anything had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, he didn't mean to scream. Rather than being caused by Kurumi's dress, the result was from being startled by Kurumi's own scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">……But Kurumi didn't seem to think so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi was now silently sitting across from Shidou. She had packed up the eyepatches and accessories back into the snack jar and even changed her clothes. However, she didn't even look at Shidou once while doing so. Apparently, that costume was something that Kurumi very much didn't want others to see.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……U-Uhh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt a little awkward as he reached for the tea cup on the table. Then, he took a sip of the black tea that Kurumi had made earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un……r-really, it tastes delicious. Tea leaves are great and the brewing method is also fantastic."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou breathed out his thoughts. It would be a lie to say this wasn't to please Kurumi, but these were the genuine feelings coming from his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards, Kurumi finally glanced at Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Saying that really couldn't be any better. Incidentally, have you heard this story before Shidou-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Strychnine, a highly toxic substance, has a strong bitter taste so it's a classic mixture for poisoning when mixed into tea or coffee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Buh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou involuntarily coughed upon hearing Kurumi's words. However, Kurumi calmly narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the matter with you Shidou-san, coughing like that when I'm just talking casually."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou responded with a hoarse voice, Kurumi replied with a "well, but‐‐" and continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If the powerless me, who has lost the power of the Spirits, was faced with the situation of sealing the mouth of someone, surely poison will have to be employed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing this euphemistic and forward threat, Shidou felt his cheeks spasm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't tell anyone……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What do you mean? I don't understand what Shidou-san is trying to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Shidou had said, Kurumi turned her face away. ……It looks like Kurumi would prefer denying anything had happened rather than keeping it a secret.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, even if Shidou followed along with that, it wouldn't completely wipe out Kurumi's distrust. Shidou let out a muffled groan while trying to think up of a method.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, he reached one idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Gu."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a means he wanted to avoid as much as possible……but it couldn't be helped. Shidou decided to steel himself as he raised his face. "Um Kurumi, there's something that I want to show you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi spoke with a curt look. Shidou opened a photo folder in his smart phone and picked out a certain image to show Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the photo, Kurumi widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that should be expected. After all, what displayed there was‐‐Shidou in his junior high years, with him wearing an eyepatch and bandages exactly like what Kurumi had just been doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, it's embarrassing now, but there was a time when I thought this was cool. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to be only doing this at home. ……Can you please not tell anyone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked with a reddish face, Kurumi showed a surprised look before quickly giggling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Yes, yes, I understand. People often say that everyone has their own past."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kurumi spoke, the evil expression just now had completely disappeared from her face. It felt like a strange sense of solidarity rather than secretly sharing each other's shameful past. ‐‐Well, to phrase it differently, she might have felt a sense of security from being able to now take Shidou's past hostage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, the uncomfortable atmosphere had finally subsided. Shidou breathed out a sigh of relief as he turned his attention to the snack jar on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did that……belong to a clone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt almost too afraid to ask that question. The medical eyepatch worn by Kurumi just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Five years ago‐‐no, six years ago if counting from now‐‐it was identical to what she wore then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi, who had calmed down a bit, opened the jar and showed the accessories to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"These are remnants belonging to my four most troublesome clones. ‐‐Although they were helplessly noisy individuals, it does feel rather lonely after they are gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a distant look in her eyes, Kurumi softly sighed. From that expression, there were both nostalgic for the past and sorrow from losing a dear friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was inevitable. Kurumi's clones were a pseudo-life form created by the authority of her Angel. Now that they have lost the powers of the Spirits, they could no longer maintain their form.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking of this, Shidou suddenly frowned. The question that had been lingering in his mind for a while now suddenly reappeared at this moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kurumi, there's a question that wondering about for a while now. May I ask it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, please rest assured. I'm not in any relationship with any perfect gentlemen."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Kurumi closed her eyes and answered in a playful tone. Shidou scratched his cheek while smiling bitterly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm not asking about that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, then what on earth is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou coughed a little to readjust himself before continuing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During the battle on year ago‐‐Mio emerged out from you. And then you survived by entrusting your memories and Sephira Crystal to a clone created by the Eighth Bullet <Het>."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes‐‐something like that did occur."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Shidou's question, Kurumi answered while taking a sip of the black tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, to be precise, the Kurumi here right now was not exactly the same as the one from a year ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to avoid her destined demise caused by Mio, a new Kurumi was born from her transferring everything to another body.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, Kurumi's current body should have the same composition as the other clones that vanished when all of the Reiryoku had disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you continue to exist even without the power of the Spirits? Obviously, the other clones have already disappeared."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara. Is Shidou-san saying that I should have disappeared?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said that while looking into Shidou's face. Shidou shook his head with a troubled look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's not what I'm saying. I am glad you were safe. Just‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐You want to know the difference between me and Tohka-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to those words, Shidou held his breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't the question he was thinking about. But right after the moment that was said, Shidou realized he was looking for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi seemed amused by this thought, but then sadly looked at Shidou while softly shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like I can't tell you, but the truth is simple enough to be disappointing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, with her right hand assuming the gesture of a gun, she pointed her index finger at her own forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because my current self's body is not a clone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a simple story. After transferring my memories and Sephira Crystal to a clone, I used the Fourth Bullet <Dalet>to restore my original body that was tossed aside by Mio-san and then transferred my memories Sephira back there again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou widened his eyes. No way, so that was what Kurumi was doing behind the scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you do that? Did you know then that the power of the Spirits was going to disappear?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I didn't expect it to go that far. However, although I managed to survive, a clone's body is unstable and short-lived. I was already at the limit to use it as a temporary refuge. ‐‐Well, if my original body was shattered to the point of not even dust left behind, it would have been game over for me then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou nodded with sweat dripping down his face. ……Transferring memories and repairing her original body, it felt like something coming from a mechanical body like Maria rather than from a living creature. But then again, this did make sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">The key to surviving was to have a human body the moment Mio's Sephira Crystal disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Kurumi was still in a body made from Reiryoku, she may have disappeared just like Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was considering this over, Kurumi narrowed her eyes and licked her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, yes‐‐there was one more troubling thing about this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Troubling?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Kurumi said "yes", nodding while standing up from the sofa to sit next to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she leaned against Shidou in a sensation gesture. Shidou's shoulders started to tremble a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Kurumi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu……indeed I survived that battle through using a clone's body. However, when I transferred my memories to that clone, my consciousness mixed with that of the clone's original consciousness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's eyes widened.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it wasn't as if he couldn't understand what Kurumi was saying. Although the clone was a temporary refuge for her, it should have also contained the clone's own consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">While she underwent a different process, the situation was similar to what happened to Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">Additionally, a mixed consciousness is not so easily separated. Even if those memories were transferred back to the original Kurumi body, they won't be separated. And it remained a part of the original Kurumi. If the consciousness of the clone survived even after Mio's death, then in that case‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In other words……that means the current Kurumi is a fusion of the clone and original?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's right. Of course, because I am the original, there shouldn't be anything too strange felt, but‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi gave a charming smile as she gently stroked Shidou's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐A younger, more aggressive and more curious individual has been added into me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha, wha, wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she whispered into his ear, Shidou felt his entire face turn red. He hurriedly got up from the sofa and took a step back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara, what's wrong Shidou-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You……"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou accidentally knocked down the jar. The floor was covered by a thick velvet rug so it didn't make too much noise. However, the eyepatches stored inside were all scattered on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……sorry……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was picking up the eyepatches, he couldn't help but think of one more thing of note.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words unintentionally leaked out from his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Perhaps you were under the influence of that younger individual to wear that eyepatch earlier……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he said that, Kurumi's calm smile disappeared as she froze in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, cold sweat began falling from her forehead as she touched her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't expect such a thing……no, it's possible……otherwise, even though it was for a moment, I should have never made that mistake……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's complexion turned pale as she started hitting her forehead against a pillar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me! Get out of my body! Come out! Evil spirit begone! Evil spirit begone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"C-Calm down Kurumi! Isn't it your own past rather than an evil spirit!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I hate thiiiiiiiiis!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being caught by Shidou and having her arms held in place, Kurumi screamed while struggling her legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Kurumi was still Kurumi. Despite the shortness of her breathing, she quickly calmed down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Sorry about that. I'm fine now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou let go of his grip, Kurumi stepped back to her original seat with swaying steps. She gulped down the remaining black tea in a single breath. While there should be no alcohol in there, it looked like she was drinking sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Are you okay, Kurumi……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes. I showed you something unsightly. Even if our minds mix, she is just a clone. I have control over my consciousness. ‐‐Moreover, if I didn't do that, I wouldn't have been able to survive. I can only accept this as part of the stigma of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">From those words, it didn't seem like she was under the influence of her younger self. But Shidou decided to stay silent and pretend not to notice.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the wall clock in the corner of the living room started let out a low……dong, dong sound. Kurumi raised her eyebrows in surprise as she looked over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Oh, it's already time. It all just flew by so unexpectedly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, my bad. I didn't intend to stay for this long……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, perhaps being with Shidou-san is why time flew by so quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi closed one eye and said in a playful tone. Shidou gave a faint smile in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, did you have anything planned afterwards?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, well. It wasn't exactly decided, but‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kurumi spoke, she started to nod as if coming up with something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Shidou-san is free, can you accompany me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's fine……but what are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After being questioned, Kurumi gave a complicated smile while continuing to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I was thinking, a little about saying hello to an old friend."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Howling. Roaring. Beast let out a roar.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if screaming. As if sobbing. As if lamenting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Collapsing the heavens, rending the earth, a major disaster without equal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slaughter everything. Devour everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the thirst would not yield. But the heart was not satisfied.</p>
<p class="null-p">Beast howled and screamed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing in the world could satisfy Beast.</p>
<p class="null-p">There weren't even any memories of why Beast was screaming.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Beast could only roar. There was no choice but to yell.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because apart from that, there was nothing else that Beast could do‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……ah……‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">But at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something was heard in the ears of Beast.</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice, a call, someone was calling to Beast.</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice to hazy and weak to even be called a tremor.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this was the only beacon for Beast who had lost all purpose and forgotten every meaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A , a, aaaaaaaa‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Beast let out a particularly loud roar‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Her claws tore through the void.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">It took about an hour to transfer from Tenguu City through trains and buses. Shidou and Kurumi were visiting a cemetery in the suburbs.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a well-maintained cemetery with a vast site as its selling point. In the open space as far as one could see, short tombstones were regularly arranged. "‐‐It's here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking quietly, Kurumi walked along the crossroads stretching between the graves. Surely she must have visited here several times already. There was no hesitation in her steps.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was dressed in the same monotone outfit as before, it looked to be a mourning dress in this place. Well, the black parasol and bouquet in her hands probably helped accentuate this impression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, it seemed that Kurumi was planning on visiting a grave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's best friend who lost her life more than 20 years ago‐‐to pay respects at Yamauchi Sawa's grave.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why she took out the keepsakes of her clones was also because of this. The clones were a reproduction of Kurumi's past. In short, they also had many memories of Sawa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, Kurumi thought that they should visit Sawa's grave together. Right now, there was a small bag hanging on her shoulders that contained the four eyepatches.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gently scratched his head while walking behind Kurumi around the cemetery.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Wondering if it was appropriate for him to visit such an important friend's grave.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if noticing what he was thinking, Kurumi turned to look back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need to feel embarrassed. Sawa-san would like it to be a bit livelier. She must be bored with me alone all the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi laughed while saying that. Of course, this was a joke to lighten the atmosphere, but Shidou couldn't easily agree without displaying a forced smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon after, Kurumi stopped. Taking a look at it, the name SAWA YAMAUCHI was engraved on the tombstone in front of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here it is‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it is Sawa-san's grave. ‐‐That being said, there's no body buried under the tombstone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi spoke while narrowing her eyes with ever the lonely look.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Yamauchi Sawa was a close friend of Kurumi before she became a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, given a Sephira Crystal by the Spirit of Origin, she became a runaway monster‐‐and had her life ended by Kurumi's own hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because she didn't leave a body behind, she was regarded as missing rather than dead. Because she disappeared from unknown reasons, she was treated as if having been spirited away and stirred a commotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…… Sawa-san's parents have been searching for her as well, but after ten years without any trace, they have gradually given up and created this grave .‐‐And perhaps they couldn't even dreamed, that the one who murdered their daughter would come here every year to set flowers like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">While speaking like she was mocking herself, Kurumi placed the bouquet of flowers on her hand in front of the grave.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Kurumi put down the parasol, taking out four eyepatches from her pouch and wrapped it around her wrist, and then she clasped her hands and closed her eyes as if praying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou also clapped his hands in the same way and silently prayed. The sound of wind gently brushing the plants felt a little bit louder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">How much time had passed? Hearing Kurumi's soft voice, Shidou opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Certainly, Sawa-san also feels very happy. ‐‐Because I brought a gentleman here, she would be very surprised."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, maybe that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We shouldn't leave until explaining our relationship. If requested that, how would Shidou-san respond?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi asked with a smile as her eyes revealed her amusement. Shidou faintly looked away while replying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Of course……it's friends. No, rather it's a companion?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou replied, Kurumi let out an exaggeratedly long "ha‐‐" sigh while shrugging her shoulders.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"No good. Failure. Surely Sawa-san would have squeezed it out in her special interrogation course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Was she that sort of person!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Once she caught you, she would never let you escape. That's why she was called snakehead Sawa and soft-shelled turtle Sawa."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's not the sort of nickname you should give to a girl……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou began to sweat, Kurumi covered her mouth as if trying to suppress her laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Sawa-san was here, she would be yelling 'why would you believe that‐‐!' while shaking your shoulders."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that was a lie after all!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Shidou yell, Kurumi smiled all the more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Kurumi's expression act without any concern, Shidou couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……You must have gotten along well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes. Very much so."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying this, Kurumi raised up her face to look up at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was very mature and had a strong inner disposition. ‐‐Although she was just a high school student, she was quite calm. Really‐‐completely different from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that true? Kurumi also seems to be quite mature……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, compared to the past me, the amount of battlefields the current me has often dived into is completely different."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well……I guess that's true."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou bitterly smiled back, Kurumi, as if recalling something, said "speaking of which" as she continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Certainly Shidou-san has already met Sawa-san. Have you already forgotten?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing this, Shidou slanted his head in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was over 20 years when Sawa had died. Shidou was currently 18 years old. Unless he had seen her face in a photo, it would normally be impossible for them to meet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps they had met when Shidou was Takamiya Shinji……could that be it? No, while Shidou still had Shinji's memories, he couldn't recall ever meeting a girl named Yamauchi Sawa. Then how‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, as Shidou was puzzling over this, Kurumi continued on with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before Mio-san's Sephira disappeared, there should have been a girl that often went to school with me in the world that Tohka-san created."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Aah……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a cry as he clapped his hands together. Surely, he remembered there was a girl with Kurumi at that time. So apparently that was Sawa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that means she's……sorry, I didn't even notice it before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, it can't be helped. It was a year ago after all. More than anything‐‐it's because it felt like an illusion coming from a dream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kurumi……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou painfully called out her name, Kurumi interjected with a "but" while lowering her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because of that month that I'm my current self. Of course, Tohkasan‐‐no, Tenka-san didn't care about me. But for me it was an irreplaceable time. Really it was‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Then.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing this, Shidou was left speechless.</p>
<p class="null-p">He saw tears drip down from Kurumi's eyes as she was recalling the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi. Tokisaki Kurumi. Always calm, an unpredictable Spirit that played with Shidou in the palm of her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her display such a fragile expression, Shidou felt his heart being tightly squeezed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, aah, excuse me. I'm feeling a little too sentimental."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said with a bitter smile as she wiped the tears away with the back of her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the tears gradually permeating into the eyepatches wrapped around her wrist.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐As if the clones were wiping away Kurumi's tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, I also want to thank Tohka-san and Tenka-san. ‐‐One day, I will definitely repay her kindness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Kurumi's words, Shidou bit his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou understood her thoughts well.</p>
<p class="null-p">A phantasmal month, that lasted just for a brief time.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in the world that Tenka prepared to the very end, Shidou was able to spend one last time with Tohka. They left behind so many memories‐‐and he was also able to hear her last words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without those moments, Shidou's life would be much different than it was now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, at the same moment of recognizing this, another pain suddenly pierced Shidou's chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was both regret and self-blame. The more Kurumi thought about Sawa, the more she understood the readiness for her own sins. Shidou could feel a heavy chain tightening her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Tokisaki Kurumi. <Nightmare>. Called the Worst Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason behind that nickname was simple and clear. She has done far more harm to humans than any other Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was done in order to accumulate power for <Zafkiel>to use the Twelfth Bullet <Yud Bet>to redo everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">To travel back to the past to prevent the birth of the Spirit of Origin.</p>
<p class="null-p">To prevent Sawa's death and atone for her sins.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that alone, this kind-hearted girl stained her hands with blood and marched onto the battlefield.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that path was now completely closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐By the disappearance of the powers of the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all was said and done, the only thing left in this world was a human girl carrying the sins on her back that could never be redeemed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm sorry, Kurumi. I‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ara, ara."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou struggled to say something, Kurumi gave a troubled smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What strange thing are you saying now? Shidou-san has no reason to apologize. Or does Shidou-san know something that I didn't?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she shrugged her shoulders as if telling a joke. ……Of course, it was impossible for her to not notice. Shidou clenched his fist as he continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I couldn't……keep my promise to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. When Shidou and Kurumi were wagering their Reiryoku in a competition against each other, Shidou had told Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐I will use the Twelfth Bullet <Yud Bet>to reset everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to change history and create a world that satisfied everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing that, Kurumi laughed as if treating it as a joke‐‐but then made the decision to entrust her Reiryoku to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Kurumi didn't accept Shidou's words whole-heartedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even if only a little, she had believed in him. She had entrusted her dream to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shidou failed to live up to her expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after a year had passed, this regret still weighed heavily on his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, Kurumi shook her head with her eyes still looking down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san did a fantastic job. Taking on the overwhelming Spirit of Origin as an opponent, and creating a miracle like sewing a needle through the smallest hole, we have you to thank for coming out alive. If there was even the slightest mistake, no one would have survived. There's no result better than this. Please hold out your chest in pride."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Shidou's words stopped there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Shidou was about to speak, Kurumi pressed her index finger against his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Saying anything more would be insensitive, Shidou-san‐‐moreover, Shidou-san is misunderstanding something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Misunderstanding something……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou raised his eyebrows while confused, Kurumi distorted her lips into a crescent shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Kihihi, hihi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Her expression caused Shidou's heart to beat faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">This smile was different from gentle expression Kurumi had before‐‐it was the same terrifying smile shown when she was called the Worst Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you really think that, I, Tokisaki Kurumi, have given up? Left alone with thoughts about my deceased friend, having regrets over the lives I've killed, becoming a weak human begging God for forgiveness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi narrowed her eyes as if peeping though Shidou's face. Her sudden change frightened him.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kurumi continued on without hesitation. She carried forward as if singing, as if reciting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wouldn't have chosen this path if I would fold my knees down here. I haven't given up on anything. I haven't abandoned anything. Whether it's Sawa-san's death or my own sins, I will still try to settle all accounts." "How……what are you going to do!? The power of the Spirits gone……!?" As Shidou asked, Kurumi's smile grew stronger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. That's right. But what does it mean to no longer exist? A complete disappearance? A disappearance that leaves nothing behind? Is that really possible?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi shrugged in a playful tone as she continued while stretching out her open palms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please think back. After all, what exactly is a Spirit? A Spirit is neither an alien that suddenly appeared flying from another universe nor a life that arises from nothing. It is a magical lifeform the Magician Isaac Westcott created by gathering and collecting all of the mana in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐So then what does a Spirit's disappearance mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou held his breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was able to understand what Kurumi had said as smoothly as water seeping into soil.</p>
<p class="null-p">If a building collapsed, there will be rubble. Tearing apart a book would leave paper scraps. Even if broken apart to the point where no model is left behind, they merely just lose their forms as buildings and books. The existence constituting them would not disappear.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Spirit, wasn't that the same?</p>
<p class="null-p">"A Spirit that has lost its form will return to the world as mana‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou spoke those words with a trembling voice, Kurumi nodded her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're quick to understand. ‐‐It's as if you've been thinking about this before."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kurumi gave a teasing smile, Shidou slightly looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, the world is still full of mana. So do you think it would be impossible to gather it together again? ‐‐No, unlike then, the Realizer</p>
<p class="null-p">Manifestation Device is present now. It may be possible to generate an ideal Sephira Crystal with higher accuracy than Isaac Westcott did 31</p>
<p class="null-p">years ago. And also‐‐there lays the only possibility to realize Shidou-san's absurd dream."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐That sort of thing……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's face tensed up as he squeezed out his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, this idea was understandable. But it was just empty talk on paper. In the first place, Isaac Westcott was the only person in the world to arrive at the Spirit Formula. The basic theory behind this technique was not known even to his former comrades Westcott and Karen.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the other words, the Spirit Formula was impossible to be reproduced after his death. It became so-called lost technology.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, since Westcott was able to create a Spirit, the chances of someone else in the future reaching it wasn't zero. However, for a non-magician like Kurumi mastering this method‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐Ah‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking of everything so far, Shidou felt his voice choke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">He remembered‐‐what happened a year ago in the world created by Tenka.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. At that time, it was none other than Kurumi who told Shidou that they were in an artificial world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi, with the book Angel <Rasiel>, was the first person to reach the truth in that world. That was synonymous of also knowing that the power of the Spirits would be lost after the collapse of that world.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, what did Kurumi choose to do?</p>
<p class="null-p">If he were standing in Kurumi's perspective, what would he have done in that world?</p>
<p class="null-p">Between discovering the truth of the world and tell them that.</p>
<p class="null-p">What exactly did the girl with the omniscient Angel investigate?</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Ufufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou stared blankly, Kurumi gave an amused laugh. ‐‐Not the face of the Worst Spirit, but it was the smile of a beautiful girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou-san really has an interesting reaction. ‐‐If you're surprised to this extent, I'm glad to have told that joke."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi's words cause Shidou to leave his mouth wide open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"J-Joking……!? Just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, yes. No way, did you think I was serious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, Kurumi, you……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The boring play of a woman who has no choice but to devote the remainder of her life to atonement. That much I am still able to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kurumi gave a dull chuckle. ‐‐The light dwelling in her eyes, her hopes and dreams, it didn't feel like it was gone, but rather it was shining now from something else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou scratched his face while sweating.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was she lying, guarding herself against <Ratatoskr>'s surveillance, or was it actually a joke?</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Shidou didn't know which one, he subconsciously knew not to press this issue any farther.</p>
<p class="null-p">So‐‐Shidou replied back like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes. Well, if I'm qualified, I'll accompany you on whatever you do. If you want to joke again, please call on me anytime."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ufufu, that's right. I'll let you pamper me then. ‐‐At that time, I'd love to hear about Shidou-san's joke."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Kurumi looked at each other for a while and then suddenly laughed together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Shall we go now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that sounds good."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them slightly nodded in agreement, paying their respects to Sawa's grave one last time before walking away.</p>
<p class="null-p">While crossing the vast site of the cemetery, Kurumi let out her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for today, Shidou-san. Coming all this way with me.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I wanted to talk to Kurumi as well, so the opportunity was perfect. I even got to hear an exciting joke."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, ara."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi laughed while covering her mouth with her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, that was a joke, but the wish itself isn't a lie. If Shidou-san has something to achieve, it would be better to talk about it. If you feel that others would be ashamed by this‐‐even making a wish to the stars will help your mood change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A wish to the stars……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou unconsciously stared up to the sky. Although the sun had begun to set, the sky was still blue and it would take a while before the stars can be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I especially recommend you to write that wish on a small piece of paper."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, are you thinking about a shooting star during Tanabata?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Because‐‐the wish I wrote on that sheet of paper really did come true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Kurumi had said, Shidou couldn't help but slant his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kurumi didn't answer, continuing to walk down the aisle of the cemetery with a smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After leaving the cemetery, Shidou said goodbye to Kurumi and continued walking along the quiet suburban road in a quiet manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sun was already sinking into the horizon as the surrounding scenery was dyed red. It was almost time to go home and prepare for dinner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐despite being aware of this, Shidou wasn't able to pick up his pace.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. After separating from Kurumi, there was no one to talk to, so the thoughts continue to swirl in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was nothing new. For the past month, Shidou has been thinking it over for a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">What he wanted to do, what he could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in the past few days, thanks to the conversation with Origami, Nia, and Kurumi‐‐the emotions smoldering within his heart gradually formed a more conscious image.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou believed that the peaceful everyday life was something that was difficult to come by.</p>
<p class="null-p">That wasn't a lie. There wasn't any intention of denying a world where everyone could work together.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when alone and by himself, the feelings that he tried to suppress became more prevalent.</p>
<p class="null-p">After every happy or pleasant event, he would wonder what Tohka's reaction to it would be.</p>
<p class="null-p">When there was something sad or painful, he would imagine Tohka patting him on the back.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what‐‐Tohka's smile would emerge from time to time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Originally, Shidou wasn't the sort of person good at covering things up. Even if he tried to hide it, everyone might have already seen through it.</p>
<p class="null-p">No‐‐perhaps everyone was thinking the exact same thing as Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right. He could no longer even deceive himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, I‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I want to see……Tohka again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou whispered towards the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the sunset drenched sky, the first star appearing in the evening faintly shined.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐‐just at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu‐‐‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">A disturbing alarm echoed in the skies of Tenguu City.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha‐‐‐‐‐‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than surprised or being startled, hearing that sudden alarm caused Shidou to be stunned.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound in anticipation of a Spacequake appearing‐‐in essence it was an alarm reporting the arrival of a Spirit. For a least the past year, Shidou hasn't heard this sound again.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was natural. After all, there should be no more Spirits in this world that could cause a Spacequake.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that fact was only known by those that witnessed the end of that battle last year.</p>
<p class="null-p">Residents in the neighborhood promptly evacuated into the shelter, surprised at not hearing the Spacequake alarm in such a long time. Several people ran past Shidou who was still stunned.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou didn't move. He couldn't move.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was left baffled by the unexpected situation‐‐what exactly had happened?</p>
<p class="null-p">"DEM's work……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou asked as his eyebrows felt tense.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, that was the first possibility that Shidou had thought about. The Spacequake alarm did go off when a Spacequake has been detected.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in the past DEM has also employed the usage of false alarms.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, DEM has now lost Westcott and fallen into internal strife. It didn't make sense to give opposing forces another reason to antagonize them. What's more, there are no Spirits left in today's world, so there shouldn't even be a reason for wanting to falsify an alarm.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that case‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be a new Spirit‐‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou held his breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Shidou understood that this shouldn't happen. Mio, the Spirit of Origin, had disappeared and her Sephira Crystal vanished from existence. The technique of creating Spirits was lost, leaving there no room for any new Spirits. But.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou thought to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐What if a genius magician comparable to Westcott reached the Spirit Formula?</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐What if there was other Spirits because of a reason he didn't know about?</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐What if the mana that dissolved into the world reunited for some reason‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">His own thoughts nearly caused him to suffocate.</p>
<p class="null-p">If this was happen, what was going to manifest now‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, the smartphone in his pocket began vibrating as if to interrupt his thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Kotori‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After checking the caller ID, Shidou pressed the answer button and placed the phone against his hear. A familiar voice soon sounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Shidou! Are you okay!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm fine. But what's going on with this alarm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know yet. But <Fraxinus>'s observation machine sensed a powerful</p>
<p class="null-p">Reiha response just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! A Spirit……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou spoke in a hoarse voice. The possibility that just crossed his mind emerged again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said, everything is unknown right now! Anyway, it's too dangerous for you to be there.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll pick you up with <Fraxinus>."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou shouted to block Kotori's voice. ‐‐The loudness of his voice surprised not only Kotori but also himself. After a small cough, he continued. "It might be……a Spirit. Then if that's the case, I'll have to deal with it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, the feeling of Kotori's breathing being clogged could be felt over communications.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about!? You don't have the power of the Spirits anymore! <Camael>'s blessings and <Gabriel>'s songs, everything is different from a year ago!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Listening to Kotori, Shidou ruffled his hair. Everything was exactly as Kotori had said. If Shidou was here, he would only get in the way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……My bad. It's been a long time. Please take to <Fraxinus>."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It's only about ten minutes before the Spacequake occurs. Hurry</p>
<p class="null-p">up‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, before Kotori could finish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stared at the sky with eyes open in horror.</p>
<p class="null-p">A scratch suddenly appeared in the evening sky that was transition from red to black.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">This could only be described as a scratch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Several cracks appeared as if a giant claw was tearing apart the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at the very next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With the scratch as the starting point, the sky trembled‐‐the surrounding area was blown away by a shockwave.</p>
<p class="null-p">This power was reminiscent of a Spacequake. The houses, roads, and trees at the center of the shockwave all disappeared as the surrounding scenery was mowed down by an invisible hammer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, caught within this atrocious feast, a powerless human couldn't keep his posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was blown away like a light rag as he slammed into a distant wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gah……ga……"</p>
<p class="null-p">His entire body was struck by a severe pain. Two or three ribs may be broken.</p>
<p class="null-p">But despite this, Shidou was still lucky. If his position was just tens of meters different, or if the epicenter of the explosion wasn't in the air, his entire body wouldn't have been torn to shreds with only mincemeat left behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">But he couldn't understand. Kotori had said that the Spacequake should been in ten more minutes. It was difficult to imagine that <Fraxinus>'s AI would make a huge error like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt like a balloon that was about to come contact with a needle. A strange feeling of being about to burst, Shidou's face was tense from the confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Something was wrong. However, even if he tried to confirm, he lost his smartphone when he was blown away and couldn't contact Kotori. Shidou stood up in severe pain as he pressed his weight against the wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐‐</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐‐‐Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Shidou was at a loss for words.</p>
<p class="null-p">A figure that had not existed before appeared in front of Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Long hair whose color had long since faded, she was laying her face down with an unsure facial expression as ghostly pale white skin peeked out from her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">That outfit was shredded and tore to pieces. Wearing it just like a cloak, the cracks of this Astral Dress exposed her skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">A group of swords of various shape and sizes were floating around the surroundings just like a castle wall serving as her armor. She looked as if she had been held captive in a prison.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the most distinctive characteristics were her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her hands pointed to threaten Shidou, each of the five fingers had huge nails floating across them. With a figure that looked almost delicate, she looked just like the First Beast.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Spirit. That name plundered his attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou even forget the danger to this own life as he was utterly stunned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐You, are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐, A‐‐‐‐, ‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, that girl faintly raised her head‐‐responding with a hoarse voice that was about to disappear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Name, huh? I've long forgotten such a thing‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4: Himekawa Yoshino</p>
<p class="null-p">A person's personality is not only innate, but also formed by their environment.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was a little happy when I first heard this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because if that is true, I am the way I am now thanks to Shidou-san and the others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone has taught me so much, given me so many memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">Things about the town, school, and society.</p>
<p class="null-p">The importance of the connections between people</p>
<p class="null-p">And also‐‐someone,</p>
<p class="null-p">To love.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely the accumulation of each day has made me who I am. When I think back to this, I feel proud. I am still a half-baked and immature person, but I can feel unashamed of those parts of being a human because of everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Even though Mio's Sephira Crystal disappeared, I did not disappear. Kotori-san said it was because I had a human body.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I have no memories of the time I was a human.</p>
<p class="null-p">Apart from that, it's not like I am discontent.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there are moments where I am suddenly worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Who, am I?</p>
<p class="null-p">And if I remember,</p>
<p class="null-p">Can I stay being me?</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐It was about a month ago that Yoshino was called by the airship <Fraxinus>floating above Tenguu City.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Fraxinus>became less talked about with the powers of the Spirits gone and Spacequakes no longer occurring, but the location of the lounge and facilities on the bridge were still engraved with strong memories. With familiar steps, she walked to the designated meeting room. "But……why called out so suddenly, Kotori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Along the way, Yoshino softly muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no person walking alongside her. However, it would be wrong to say that she was alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because in response to those words, the rabbit puppet Yoshinon attached to Yoshino's left hand opened her mouth with comical movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows? What will happen? Haah……is it a confession of love……!?</p>
<p class="null-p">For Kotori-chan, the airship's briefing room is synonymous with the back of the gymnasium……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While talking, Yoshinon passionately contorted her body. Yoshino faintly smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……I don't think so."</p>
<p class="null-p">While chatting, they arrived at their destination. Yoshino entered the room after some simple authentication at the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Yoshino widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. They were already other guests who had arrived first here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐Natsumi-san. And also Kaguya-san and Yuzuru-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, there were already three girls in the briefing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Incidentally, Natsumi was sitting by the table and fiddling with her smart phone. For some reason, the Yamai sisters Kaguya and Yuzuru had both of their legs constantly shaking as they were sitting on an air chair against the wall.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Fu……kuku, gradually……isn't it getting harder, Yuzuru? A-About time to give up……how about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indifferent. Yuzuru is still fine. Isn't Kaguya the one closer to her limit? Please don't force yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, the two of them continued their banter while trying to provoke each other. It seemed like they were competing in who could maintain the air chair the longest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Twin sisters with identical faces. Although they were completely indistinguishable except for difference in hairstyle and body shape, right now there was an easy to understand contrast.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaguya was heavily sweating and gritting her teeth, while Yuzuru kept a calm poker face despite having the same trembling legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Yoshino was also called in by Kotori……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon after recognizing Yoshino, Natsumi put on her smartphone on the table and turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino nodded in response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Is it also the same for Natsumi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hm. To be honest, I thought this was a notification stopping <Ratatoskr>'s assistance and a warning to move out of the apartment. But that doesn't seem to be the case with Yoshino here……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi said while sighing in a relieved manner. Yoshino gave a weak smile at her negative condition as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, after hearing what Natsumi had said, Kaguya pouted in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, Natsumi, what do you mean by that. It sounds like we might actually be in that situation……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing her response, Yuzuru gave a small chuckle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Convinced. Kaguya has a lot of noise complaints, so it might be a recommendation to leave."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Haah!? Then shouldn't Yuzuru be the same!? Where are those noise complaints even coming from!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Referral. We can't sleep because of Kaguya's snoring. Please manage this somehow. Ｙ・Y"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's obviously a complaint coming from the same room! That abbreviation doesn't hide anything at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What are you guys doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">An authoritative voice interrupted the Yamai sisters' skirmish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking up, despite not knowing how long she's been here, Kotori was in her military uniform with her eyes half-closed and holding a large envelop to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, sorry to make you all come all the way here. Yoshino, please sit down first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino obediently nodded her head as she sat down on the seat adjacent to Natsumi. Natsumi's shoulders trembled as she tried to find some distance, but she eventually stayed put after taking a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, that means you as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori spoke while gently pricking Kaguya and Yuzuru's legs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuha……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Collapse. Ku……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed both of them were already close to their limits. Both of them fell onto the floor at exactly the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu, fu……I won with 0.1 time difference. At least that's what I want to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Denial. Kaguya's legs are shorter so Kaguya's butt touched the floor first."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't the length of our legs to our hips the same!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hurry up and sit down already."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori helplessly shrugged her shoulders while sighing. Kaguya and Yuzuru expressed their understanding as they raised their hands to stand up‐‐or that's what they originally intended.</p>
<p class="null-p">They seemed unable to convince their legs to get back up, so they crawled their way up to the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming that all four of them were seated, Kotori placed the envelope in her arms on top of the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Now, there's a reason why I had everyone gather here today. There's a certain matter to notify everyone here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Certain matter……notify?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what is it? Are you going to say that Yoshinon is not a normal rabbit……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Don't interrupt with a strange coming out story."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Yoshinon's joke, Kotori rolled her eyes. Yoshino let out a small noise while lightly nudging Yoshinon's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Returning back to topic, in a sense this is a very serious matter. Well‐‐that attentive child may have already become consciously aware with just this crowd present."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said that while looking around the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yoshino had no idea what Kotori was saying as she slanted her head. The Yamai sisters also had a similar expression on their faces.</p>
<p class="null-p">But among the crowd, only Natsumi had a complicated expression while looking away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Everyone here has no memories of the past……right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing what Natsumi had said, Yoshino widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's certainly true when asked. When Mio's Sephira Crystal disappeared, the people here were not pure Spirits like Tohka.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, unlike Kotori, Origami, Miku, and Mukuro, they don't remember being given a Sephira Crystal by Mio, nor did they restore their memories through their Angels like Nia or Kurumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori gave a heavy nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐And so, as a result of <Ratatoskr>'s investigation, we've obtained the information of when you were all humans."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori took out three smaller files out from the huge envelope.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this, Kaguya and Yuzuru broadened their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……are you serious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Astonishment. Information of when Yuzuru was human……then?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. ‐‐Well, to be more precise, the information was acquired a long time ago. But it's definitely not all pleasant information, so it was debated if we should disclose this to you all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori continued while brushing the three files.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But after evaluating your lifestyle and mental stability, we finally got permission during the previous meeting. The bottom line is that your independence has been recognized. I suppose that's a good thing in of itself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Isn't it because with the power of the Spirits gone, even if our mental state is unstable, there will be no backflow of Reiryoku?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi asked that, Kotori responded with a shrug.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I won't deny that played a major role factoring in……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, as Kotori spoke, she placed the files in front of Yoshino and the others one by one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You all have a choice. One is to accept this file or not. If you chose to receive it, you can also decide if you want to even open it or not. And even if you open it, you don't have to read all of the information. As I said just now, not all of the information here is pleasant. In other words, there may even be information that you'll be better off not knowing. It also takes courage to choose to not know. There is no right answer for this. If you can't make a decision right away, feel free to consult us in a few more days. ‐‐Everything will be left to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that in mind, Kotori lowered her eyes as if to show Yoshino and the others that they wouldn't be giving up no matter what option was taken.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino fell silent for a while before gulping.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her identity was contained in an envelope right in front of her. When thinking about this, she could feel her heartbeat grow faster and faster.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the moment, there was a 'bang!' sound of something striking the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking over there, she saw that Kaguya and Yuzuru had their hands on the envelope in front of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku‐‐how interesting. Just by looking into this, we can confirm that Kaguya is the superior older sister!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Smile. Beginning from today, Kaguya will have to call Yuzuru big sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, shouldn't I be the older sister!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Explanation. Kaguya may not understand. Generally speaking, the bigger party is the older sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so Kaguya and Yuzuru started arguing again. It seems the reason why they decided so early was because they didn't want the other person to take the file first.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other hand, Natsumi approached this cautiously. After folding her arms with a difficult look on her face, she groaned as she raised her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…I'll put it on hold for the time being. Anything written must be something</p>
<p class="null-p">bad……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing responses from both sides of the spectrum, Yoshino turn to her left hand‐‐looking on at Yoshinon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshinon……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Yup. Yoshino should do as she likes."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino called out her name, Yoshinon didn't seem to be joking around as she said that while looking back into Yoshino's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Um. That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino nodded as she turned forward again with a determined look.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Um."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">One afternoon, as Shidou was folding laundry in the living room of the Itsuka residence, he suddenly heard a voice coming from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, he found that Yoshino was standing there. No, not just that. Upon a closer look, he could also see Natsumi trying to hide behind her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, what's wrong? Ah, do you want something to eat? There are cookies on the shelf and if you're willing to wait a while I can make pancakes."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Yoshino's expression brightened in an instant. However, she immediately shook her head as if remembering something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, um, I would also like snacks, but that's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino said that with a nervous look with her back hunched down as she began walking towards the side opposite of Shidou for some reason. It felt like she was imitating Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you have time……there's something that I would like to see together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"See together……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt confused by Yoshino's serious expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Yoshino gulped as she put down the large portfolio in her hands on top of the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Yoshino began to meekly explain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon hearing her explanation, Shidou couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Information of when Yoshino was human……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……it should be that."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino nodded, Shidou's eyes turned to the envelope on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">It made sense if he thought about it. Yoshino, Natsumi, and the Yamai sisters were different from the others because they had no memories of being turned into a Spirit. But since they continued to exist after the disappearance of Mio's Sephira Crystal, they must have been human at one point. In that case, it was only natural that this experience will be recorded somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That means……what about you Natsumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I also seem to have it, but……let her go first. Today I am only accompanying. Because Yoshino would feel uneasy being alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi said with an embarrassed look as she tried to drift the conversation away from herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression looked as if she was blaming herself over being indecisive about receiving the portfolio or not. Of course, Shidou didn't intend to blame her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So like this. My past……I am worried about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stopped folding his clothes as he turned towards Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the circumstances were completely different from Yoshino, Shidou had also once lost his memories of the past. He painfully understood what that feeling was like.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the parents of the Itsuka household were very good to Shidou and he was in no way dissatisfied with his life. But while he didn't know when this began, there were moments he felt uneasy. ‐‐Where did he come from?</p>
<p class="null-p">What was he doing? Not knowing about the roots of his existence produced great stress.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the case for Shidou who lost all memories of his childhood. So it was natural for Yoshino, who had lost all memories after becoming a Spirit, to want to know the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, Yoshino hasn't confirmed it herself yet? Do you really want to watch it together?</p>
<p class="null-p">Um……maybe there will be something that you don't want others to</p>
<p class="null-p">see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Yoshino's face instantly turned red as she lowered her face. Seeing Yoshino like this, it was Natsumi who struck the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What are you even thinking!? Are you suggesting that Yoshino did something strange!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh!? N-No, I didn't mean it like that……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou hurried to his own defense, the Yoshinon puppet on Yoshino's left hand shrugged with a dexterous gesture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Shidou-kun is too clumsy with his words. Rather, Yoshino is asking you to see it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou widened his eyes to Yoshinon's words, Yoshino slowly raised her lowered head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Um, I also want to know what sort of person I was. How did I live and grow up. And also‐‐why I became a Spirit."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yoshino continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a little……nervous. If I remember the past, I feel something within me will change. I like my current life. Being with everyone and Shidou-san right now, where every day is enjoyable and fun. So‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino stopped speaking for a moment as she reached out to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Please hold my hand. I don't want to go anywhere. I want to always be me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou muttered out Yoshino's name. Leaning on both hands to get his knees up, he sat down right next to Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he firmly held Yoshino's right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, leave it to me. No matter what happens, Yoshino will always be Yoshino."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Yes, Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino joyfully smiled as she nodded and tightly gripped Shidou's hand. Shidou also returned the same gesture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I'm the sempai here. After regaining Shinji's memories, have I changed at all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Shidou-san has always been Shidou-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? So don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou winked at her, Yoshino replied "yes!" as she nodded with a smile."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Yoshinon reached out as if noticing something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hold on Natsumi-chan, where are you going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Reminding by those words, Shidou and Yoshino saw Natsumi sitting on Yoshino's left side, struggling to try and leave this room. But well, since the hem of her skirt was caught by Yoshinon, her escape attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="null-p">After having her attempt foiled, Natsumi awkwardly return to her original posture and moved her mouth as she was diverting her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, how to phrase it, I just felt the murderous aura of a love comedy……like this wouldn't it be better if I'm not here? Something like that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Natsumi had said, Yoshino felt her face flush red again. But even then, she didn't let go of his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon shook her head while having her arms dexterously crossed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, it's good that your sensitivity sensor is high, but that's no good Natsumi-chan. Natsumi-chan also has a big role in holding Yoshinon's hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshinon……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. If remembering the past, Yoshinon may no longer be</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon. Yes, if I remember the days I was called the rabbit that would devour the world‐‐h-how can this be……everyone, run away……if not, I'll devour everyone……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Y-Yes. That would be terrible……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's face was sweating nervously as she held onto Yoshinon's paw.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou stared at them with a smile, taking a deep breath to regain his focus and look at the portfolio again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay……let's open it. Yoshino‐‐I'll use my hand. Is it okay for me to open it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……please."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino nervously spoke, Shidou reached out to open the portfolio with a single hand, taking out the contents and placing them on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Inside, there were several documents and an old photo held together by a paper clip.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone looking at the photo widened their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that……Yoshino?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un……yeah……wow, so cute……"</p>
<p class="null-p">While the person in the photo looked a little younger, it was without a doubt Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino was sitting in bed and wearing cute pajamas. While she was smiling shyly, there was a sense of melancholy felt that didn't match her age.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou slightly raised his brows. For some reason, there was the feeling of something being off.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was immediately discovered. Natsumi, who was also staring at the photo, suddenly let out a cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah……what about Yoshinon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. That was the source of the uncomfortable feeling. Yoshinon wasn't being worn on Yoshino's left hand in this photo.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was this photo before getting Yoshinon……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? So Yoshinon has yet to spring out yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshinon is something that sprung out……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Yoshinon's joke, Natsumi felt sweat oozing from her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Yoshino, who would usually deal with this exchange with a smile, said nothing as her eyes focused on the top of the document‐‐her eyes stared wide open at the simple name written at the introduction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Himekawa, Yoshino……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino said to herself in a low voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if letting the name echo within herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, what was recorded above was Yoshino's full name, which had been a mystery up until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Himekawa Yoshino‐‐huh. It's a good name."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah……how to say it……there's a noble feeling. Just like a</p>
<p class="null-p">Goddess……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou quietly spoke and Natsumi earnestly gave her admiration, Yoshino smiled while feeling a little embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you everyone. I feel a little shy, but……I also feel happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, she repeated muttered "Himekawa Yoshino……Himekawa Yoshino……"</p>
<p class="null-p">several times before letting out a long sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this, Natsumi gave a somewhat complicated look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about you Natsumi? Do you also want to learn your last name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Natsumi vigorously shook both her shoulders and head. "……! N-No!? My last name must be something like Nekuragawa or Inkiyada."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does such a surname actually exist……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou smiled bitterly as he continued to read the information on the document to Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Himekawa Yoshino. Suddenly disappeared 26 years ago. Perhaps that was around the time she became a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her age around that time was 13 years old. It seemed that she was a sickly child that had been hospitalized for a long time. The previous photo was likely taken around that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the father already passed away at that time, her mother worked alone to cover the hospital fees. The mother's name was Himekawa Nagisa. She was 34 years old at the time. If still alive, she would be over 60 years old now.</p>
<p class="null-p">The second page's document contained information about the time period and address of the hospital.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a serious look, Yoshino went through the documents.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she finished reading, Shidou called out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it Yoshino? Do you remember anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing what Shidou had asked, Yoshino shook her head in a slightly disappointed manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know I'm the person in the picture……but what's written here doesn't feel real to me……it's like reading a stranger's experiences."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou let out a complicated sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this was probably normal. Of course, lost memories may be restored during a chance opportunity, but that opportunity varies from person to person. When reading a past that couldn't be remembered, it wasn't unreasonable to have this impression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Shidou noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino looked intimated when looking at the address on the second document.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Would you like to go see there? Tomorrow is a day off from school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing what Shidou had proposed, Yoshino felt her shoulders suddenly tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened her eyes and turned her attention to Shidou. It seemed rather than "why?" or "why check it out?" it was rather "why could you tell what I was thinking?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, after all, you looked like you wanted to go."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said with a grin, Yoshino shrank back in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, there's no more need for words between you two!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshinon……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino moved to cover Yoshinon's mouth. Shidou laughed as he continued speaking while stroking Yoshino's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, it's decided. Tomorrow morning, when you're ready, we'll meet up</p>
<p class="null-p">by your doorstep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino, Yoshinon, Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Hey!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing this, Natsumi let out a cry as if having been deliberately provoked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm going too!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about? Of course. Or do you have something else you need to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's not the case, but if I go that'll prevent you two……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi was babbling on, Yoshino turned to her with slightly moist eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it……no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi let out a groan before raising her hands up in the air to surrender.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I understand. I'll also go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino's sad expression instantly brightened. Seeing this, Natsumi let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……But, we don't even know if Yoshino's mother still lives there? Should we have <Ratatoskr>investigate first?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, we shouldn't bother them too much. Moreover……even if she's no longer there, I think I should remember something if I see the street where she used to live."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing what Natsumi had said, Yoshino replied with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it couldn't be helped, it wasn't as if she didn't understand Shidou and Natsumi's intentions. Indeed, it wasn't pointless to act after obtaining a more detailed report from</p>
<p class="null-p"><Ratatoskr>‐‐but for this matter it would best to keep some level of ambiguity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although unlikely, she may remember her memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">She may meet her mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">This ambiguous expectation was just right.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was already certain, she definitely wouldn't be able to make a firm resolution because of her fears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But……if I can meet mom, I've already decided the first thing to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What's that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi asked, Yoshino replied with a bright smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will introduce her to my most important friends."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Yoshino had said, Natsumi looked away as her face flushed in a red hue.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The next morning, after gathering in front of the Itsuka residence, they headed to Tenguu station and took a train to arrive at a certain town in the Kanagawa Prefecture.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday, they've already planned on the trip from the address on the document. Twenty minutes after taking the bus from the nearest station, Shidou and the others arrived at a quiet residential area overlooking the sea from the distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un‐‐the wind feels comfortable. The view is also great. This is a good place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, the place where Yoshino lived……I see, so this is the holy land……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou stretched his back, Natsumi trailed behind afterwards as she muttered to herself while stroking her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">In contrast, Yoshino didn't say anything as she looked around with eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong, Yoshino?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Yoshino shook her head after looking deep in thought briefly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't……remember anything at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Well, let's go to your former home first and take a look."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino displayed a tense look on her face while nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't unreasonable at all. After all, they were heading to the home she lived over 26 years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">And perhaps they'll get to meet her mother who she hasn't seen at all during this long period of time. Although they didn't know if she would accept how Yoshino still looked the same, Yoshino was still her daughter. Even if they only get to look for afar, it was still bound to be a special experience. It was impossible to not be nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou brought up the map on his smartphone and led Yoshino and Natsumi walking down the street.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Shidou's feet came to a stop. As a result, there was a domino collision of Yoshino bumping into his back and Natsumi hitting Yoshino's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow! W-What happened suddenly……"</p>
<p class="null-p">A small scream and dissatisfied complaint came from behind. After apologizing, Shidou turned to the front.</p>
<p class="null-p">"According to the map, it seems that this was Yoshino's house……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Shidou had said, Yoshino looked surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was to be expected. After all, it wasn't a house or apartment in front of them, but rather a convenience store that could also often be found in Tenguu City.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hyah, Yoshino really lived in a funky place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……well, 26 years have already passed……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi whispered while scratching her face. ……Well, it was a situation that could have been foreseen. In fact, Natsumi proposed to have <Ratatoskr>confirm beforehand in anticipation of this scenario.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, while it wasn't known if she was already mentally prepared for this situation, Yoshino didn't look too regretful. Well of course, it may also be because that she still doesn't have any real memories about her past.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a precautionary measure, they spoke to the nearby residents but still couldn't get any useful information. What they discovered was that even people living here for over 20 years didn't know about a person named Himekawa living here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe you moved around a lot……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou scratched his head, Natsumi exchanged glances with him and groaned with a distressed look. It seemed there was something that she didn't want Yoshino to hear. Shidou turned his face to Natsumi while hiding his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What is it Natsumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Natsumi also replied back in a low voice so Yoshino couldn't overhear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I wanted to say, didn't her daughter disappear 26 years ago? Would she really move so soon? Although some people would want to leave a place with sad memories, shouldn't parental love mean guarding the home where her daughter might return…..? But I also don't have kids, so I wouldn't</p>
<p class="null-p">know……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, what Natsumi said did make sense. Shidou let out a small groan while caressing his chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So why aren't there even traces of once having lived here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi awkwardly kept her mouth silent. ……But it was easy to see from her expression what possibilities she was thinking about. Indeed, it was something they certainly didn't wish to tell Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Shidou-san. Natsumi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hya!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino suddenly spoke, both Shidou and Natsumi felt their bodies tremble from surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? What? A secret story shared only between two people? What bad things are you planning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon brought her folded arms closer to her face. Shidou and Natsumi tried to dodge the issue with a vague smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-It's nothing. Compared to that, is there anything wrong Yoshino?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Yoshino raised her face and pointed towards a long hill extending out from the residential area.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Next I want to……look over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou turned to the direction that Yoshino pointed towards with her fingertips.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a huge hospital over there.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐She was pointing to the very same place where Yoshino was hospitalized in the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">While not consciously thinking of it, she seemed strangely worried about that place while walking along the street.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had originally planned to visit that place after finding her former house. Shidou and the others climbed the long hill and arrived at building composed of huge white walls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow. It looked close, but it was still quite a bit far away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey……climbing……that slope……not easy……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi was panting as her breathing turned ragged. Seeing her being this much exhausted, Shidou unintentionally smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, Shidou-san, Natsumi-san. Making you accompany me all the way out here……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!? N-No!? I'm just lacking in exercise!? Rather shouldn't I be thanking you!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino spoke with regret, Natsumi straightened her posture while desperately waving her hands out. Seeing her like this, Shidou couldn't help but laugh. Seeing such obviously laughter directed towards her, Natsumi stared at Shidou while saying, "W-What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing, haha……compared to that, do you remember anything Yoshino?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, Yoshino looked around the lobby of the hospital first just like what she did before with the town.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's like……I've been here before……and also never been here before……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……but somehow the smell of disinfectant seems familiar……gasp, could this be the story of when Yoshino was an unlicensed doctor……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino pursed her brows in deep thought, Yoshinon spoke as her body was quivering. It seems like she still can't remember clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well……we know the room number of where you were hospitalized in, but I don't think they'll let us go that far……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, it happened just at the moment when Shidou was thinking that over, "‐‐Yoshinon!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice suddenly came from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Who……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As both Yoshino and Natsumi let out a startled cry, Shidou turned towards the source of the voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a nurse standing over there. She was an elegant woman who looked to be in her 50s.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she was the head nurse of this hospital. A name tag was worn on her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a woman opened her eyes in surprise and shouted loudly. The surrounding nurses and patients also gave surprised looks.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the woman didn't care about that as she squatted down towards Yoshino. Then, she alternated between looking at her face and the Yoshinon puppet in her left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible, this can't be……but‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahha, a really headache. Has Yoshinon's popularity finally reached a national level?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshinon joked around, the woman gently touch Yoshinon just to make sure before returning back to look at Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps you are……Yoshino-chan's daughter……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that while staring at Yoshino's face. Hearing those words, everyone widened their eyes at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You know about Yoshino……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked, the woman slowly nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……more than 20 years ago……I was in charge of that girl in the past. You look exactly the same as that child. Also, this puppet is Yoshinon, correct?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. I am Yoshinon. This one is Yoshino's child, Yoshie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……? Ah, yes, I am Yoshie."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Yoshinon had said, Yoshino rushed to agree. Well, 26 years have passed since Yoshino disappeared. Rather than saying that Yoshino had reappeared looking exactly the same, it was easier to do this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the woman looked deeply moved as she tightly hugged Yoshino with moistened eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……? Um……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a relief……Yoshino-chan was safe. Really……it's a relief to hear."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino looked confused at the woman hugging her, but soon she let go after a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, s-sorry for suddenly doing something like that. I never thought that I would be able to meet Yoshino's daughter……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-No, it's fine. Compared to this, if it's fine, um‐‐can you tell me more about my mother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino asked that, the woman tilted her head strangely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind……but where is Yoshino-chan now? Didn't you come together today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, that's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino struggled to answer the woman's question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it was a natural question to ask. Given Yoshino's physique, it would be natural to imagine her being accompanied by her parents. She would probably think that it would be better to ask her mother personally.</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, it probably wouldn't be ideal to tell her that "Yoshino is dead". Shidou thought about what to say next.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Natsumi was thinking one step ahead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Um, actually, Yoshie's mother Yoshino-san has lost her memories……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman let out a surprised cry in response to what Natsumi had said. Natsumi continued on while slightly looking away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The name of the hospital was found in her previous belongings, so we wondered if there were any clues here. She was originally supposed to come here, but her health is poor, so we've come on her behalf, yes……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi spoke a carefully crafted story at every corner. Of course, since the truth was intertwined, there was a strange persuasive power.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman whispered before finally nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. ‐‐I hope I can help if it's within the range of what I know. But here isn't ideal, how about we go somewhere else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino nodded with a clear expression as she followed behind that woman. Shidou and Natsumi also trailed behind them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……My only strength is making fraudulent and spurious statements." "Hey……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou couldn't help but grin as Natsumi gave a self-deprecating smile. But that talent wasn't useless. It could be said that her talent was what allowed them to overcome that hurdle just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, they arrived at a small reception room. The woman invited them in while pouring barley tea into paper cups.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Speaking of which, I still have introduced myself. My name is Sumida Kaho, a supervisor here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, my name is Itsuka Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I am Itsuka Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Shidou's lead, Natsumi introduced herself like this. It would weird not to give her full name, so she used the same one she used during her time in junior high school. As a result, Kaho would probably recognize Shidou and Natsumi as siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh……Himekawa, Yoshie."</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards, Yoshino shyly spoke. Perhaps she was nervous using her last name for the first time rather than using a false first name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Wilhelm von Yoshinon."</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, Yoshinon triumphantly declared while folding her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaho lightly laughed at Yoshinon's joke, narrowing her eyes as if reminiscing over the old days.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uhh……hmm. Where should I start? Like I said earlier, Yoshino-chan was my patient. She had been hospitalized for a long time, so she never went to school. Well, because of studying properly in the hospital room, she was quite the smart child."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Kaho turned her eyes to Yoshinon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I remember that Yoshinon was a gift given to Yoshino-chan by her mother Nagisa-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that……right……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino widened her eyes while looking at Yoshinon. Yoshino screamed "Kya! All of Yoshinon's secrets are being exposed!" while contorting her body."</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the perspective of onlookers, they had such a close mother daughter relationship. Really, it was to the extent where it was enviable. So when‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes, well."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Kaho hesitated.</p>
<p class="null-p">It looked like it was something difficult to talk about rather than not being able to remember the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐It's fine. Please tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino probably noticed this as well. She looked directly into Kaho's eyes while giving a vigorous nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaho hesitated for a moment, but then she continued on after being moved by Yoshino's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……When did that happen? The hospital was suddenly contacted. Nagisasan was involved in an accident in her workplace and critically injured."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou couldn't help but hold his breath. Natsumi also had the same expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……In the end, the treatment was ineffective and Nagisa-san couldn't be brought back. ……Nagisa-san was Yoshino-chan's only family. Of course, we would have to tell her. ……But I didn't know what to say. How could I? To tell such a cruel fact to a girl fighting an incurable illness."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaho spoke while lowering her eyes and painfully shaking her head. Her perspective was understandable. If Shidou was in her position, he also wouldn't have been able to easily convey this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaho let out a long sigh, raising her head as she continued to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐That's when. That incident happened."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That incident……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. ‐‐Yoshino-chan suddenly disappeared from the hospital room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, Shidou's widened his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps it was then, the Spirit of Origin‐‐Mio handed Yoshino a Sephira Crystal and turned her into a Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">But of course Kaho wouldn't know about that. While retracting back her shoulders, she let out another long sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It caused a huge commotion at the time. Talks of if she went looking for Nagisa-san who had stopped visiting, talks if she had heard Nagisa-san's death from somewhere and went following after her, various theories were being thrown around. Of course, the police searched……but in the end it came up inconclusive."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Kaho turned to Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So when I saw Yoshinon, I was so surprised. I really didn't know that</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino-chan was still alive and even have such a big daughter. Really…… I'm so glad."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kaho took out a handkerchief from her pocket to wipe away the tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha…..I'm sorry. As I get older, it becomes so much easier to be sentimental."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sumida-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino gave a complicated expression, looking down for a moment before finally looking up again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Thank you. For telling me about mother. And remembering……what happened to mother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no. I'm the one that needs to thank you. Thank you for visiting here. Thanks to you, I feel like I can finally move on from something weighing on my mind for so many years."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a more cheerful expression, Kaho lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino retuned the gesture as she continued in a somewhat reluctant tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So……um, if it's okay, can I ask for one last request for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Request? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I want to take a look at room 302 of the internal medicine ward. I want to take a picture there to show my mother."</p>
<p class="null-p">Room 302. That room was‐‐nothing more than the room where Yoshino was once hospitalized.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Room 302…..huh. If I recall, no one is in there right now. Hmm, normally it wouldn't be allowed……but can you keep a secret?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kaho gave a mischievous wink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Thank you so much……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino bowed her head, Shidou and Natsumi also did the same as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, let's go right away. Follow me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Kaho lead everyone out of the room as Shidou and the others followed her down the hospital corridors.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, crossing over to the hospital ward, they took the elevator and arrived at their destination of room 302.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Over here. Please come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Invited by Kaho, Yoshino nervously stepped into the hospital room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Walking into the room, she took a look around inside. Shidou and Natsumi also entered into the room after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Kaho let out an "ah" sound as if recalling something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That' right. I've almost forgotten. ‐‐There's something I have to give to Yoshie-chan. Can I leave you alone to look around this room for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Ah, yes‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time Shidou responded, Kaho had already disappeared into the hallway. There was only the faint echo of footsteps moving farther way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something that must be handed to Yoshino, while he didn't know what that may be, perhaps it should be viewed as a lucky opportunity to carefully observe this room. Shidou turned his head back to look around.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an innocuous hospital room with a white bed, round chairs, and a TV on the cabinet.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he could see the scenery of the city and the sea extending beyond through the window behind the curtain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here is……Yoshino's."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. How about it Yoshino, anything‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's words stopped right there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino stood at the spot with her eyes wide open and staring blankly.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Guruguru, her consciousness spun around. Kyurukyuru, the recollections swirled like a whirlpool.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless of how much information that was heard or seen, the information without a real image gradually took on a shape. Yoshino felt a numbing headache as she suddenly fell on her knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">But withstand this a little more. It seemed she was going to remember something soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right. I was certainly in this room once. Only this small space was Yoshino's castle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only this small scenery seen by this window was Yoshino's world. And‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Knock, knock, the sound of a door being lightly tapped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning around, Yoshino noticed that she was sitting on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, that wasn't all. Yoshino's outfit had transformed into cute pajamas and Shido and Natsumi had disappeared from the hospital room. And also Yoshinon wasn't on her left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, there was no strange sense of discomfort. That's right. This felt rather ordinary. Today was such that she had to respond to that knocking sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Yoshino was always looking forward to this visit today‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino replied as the door to the hospital room was being opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yay! Are you feeling well today, Yoshino! Mommy is here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While energetically saying that, a single woman entered the hospital room. A woman who wore no makeup and had her hair causally tied back. She was wearing on the scene clothes for field work, but because it was hot today, the upper part of her body had switched to a tank top. A battered backpack was hanging on her shoulders and a motorcycle helmet was carried in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although this energetic woman was the exact opposite of Yoshino who had a sickly constitution‐‐she was Yoshino's mother, Himekawa Nagisa.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Mom!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino raised her voice, closing the book she was reading as she turned towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufufu, I've kept you waiting."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagisa smiled as she walked towards the bed to gently caress Yoshino's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, I'm still ticklish there."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino said while slightly twisting her body, Nagisa gave an amused look as she started caressing Yoshino's head with both of her hands. "Since you're late, I was wondering if you would come today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, work on the site drag on a little bit longer than expected." Nagisa apologized while exasperatingly holding her hands together.</p>
<p class="null-p">But then, her eyes immediately began to shine after recalling something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, to tell the truth, I have a present today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Present……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino slanted her head while widening her eyes, Nagisa hummed, giving a fearless smile as she sat on a chair besides the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it's been kept secret until today, but mommy is a descendant from a ninja."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Is that true?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you don't believe me? Look here! Ha! Ninja Art Clone technique!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, after searching through her backpack under the bed, she raised her hands.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing what was in her arms, Yoshino widened her eyes. Taken from under the bed, Nagisa's hand was wearing a cute rabbit puppet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Yoshino. I am your new mother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, why are you doing as you please so quickly? I'm the real mother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What are you talking about? You don't even have any rabbit ears."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What're you saying? Aren't you looking down on primates too much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, like this Nagisa and the puppet began their performance. Yoshino watched on with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amazing. How did you do this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, practiced during my free time. Isn't it skillful?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it's cute. ……But why is the right eye an eyepatch?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good question. It's supposed to be a wound caused an old nemesis during a past decisive battle, but the eyepatch is actually a restraint. When the seal is unlocked, this rabbit will devour the world‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I actually ran out of materials halfway through."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino earnestly asked, Nagisa confessed with sweat dripping down.</p>
<p class="null-p">But because the response was so amusing, Yoshino couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, can I try wearing it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? Ah, of course. Kukuku, but can you handle it well……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagisa smiled proudly. Yoshino placed the rabbit on her left hand and tried as much as possible moving the mouth to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Yahah. Thank you for your troubles my other self. Kukuku, everything has gone according to plan. So I have obtained a new body."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……what!? You horrible rabbit, what are you going to do to my Yoshino!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pointless to ask. Of course, I'm going to make her part of my rabbit empire!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ku……how can I let you succeed! Killer move, rabbit ear squeeze!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gya! My‐‐power‐‐fad‐‐ing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">……And so, at this point, both of them burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, ahahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with this? Are you even more skilled than me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing like that. I was just imitating mom. ……By the way, what is this child's name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Hmm……well then, Yoshinon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Then it sounds like my alternate self rather than mom's."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that great? Yoshinon sounds much cuter than Nagisan."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Nagisa smiled happily while waving her hand. Yoshino replied back with a</p>
<p class="null-p">"then".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me make a puppet for mom next time. ‐‐My other self."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I can always be with my mom's other self, wouldn't it be lonely for mom to be alone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hiyu! Really? Mom is going to cry from being moved by this! Then, the name will be Yoshinon Junior."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, shouldn't it be Nagisan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would be too confusing if Yoshinon is my other self and Nagisan is Yoshino's other self. So if all of the other rabbit puppets are ranked according to the Yoshinon series, I'm sure there will be a rise in Yoshino's happiness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really……mom really loves me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuhaha! Did you just realize that now! Mom is the person who loves Yoshino the most!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagisa cheerfully laughed while gently caressing Yoshino's head again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Anyway, even if I can't always come by and visit, I will always be watching over Yoshino."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino tightly hugged the rabbit puppet‐‐Yoshinon, and strongly nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you too……mom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐shino, Yoshino!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino raised her face as she felt her shoulders being shaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking around, Shidou and Natsumi's faces came into view.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Yoshino had come visit here with those two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And she understood. What she had seen just now was‐‐unmistakably the memories of Himekawa Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I……remembered……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! Really, Yoshino‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Yoshino had said, Shidou raised his voice in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">But then, he closed his mouth after just saying a few words, merely staring at Yoshino with a confused look.</p>
<p class="null-p">But doing anything else might have been impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐From Yoshino's eyes, he saw tears begun to overflow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, ah, ahhhhhhhhhhhh‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino was silently sobbing as her body fell onto the bed. Her hands tightly gripped the bed sheets as the tears continued to fall.</p>
<p class="null-p">While understanding she shouldn't stain the hospital's equipment, she couldn't hold back her tears and voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">The information that seemed like someone else's life gradually gained color.</p>
<p class="null-p">An irrepressible feeling that was invisible to the naked eye had begun to leak.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Why, why did she ever forget this?</p>
<p class="null-p">The feeling of having been so loved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nagisa, who was so closed to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino moved her trembling hand while facing the rabbit puppet on her left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry……I've forgotten for so long……Yoshinon is‐‐my mom watching me all this time……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Yoshinon slowly swung her head to gently caress Yoshino's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐No, it is fine, Yoshino. Yoshino being healthy is better than anything else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">That voice, the feeling of her head being stroked, it was almost as if Nagisa herself was still here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino tightly hugged Yoshinon while crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Un."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and Natsumi gently whispered, but other than that they said nothing as they gently stroked Yoshino's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">The warm touch made Yoshino feel a mysterious strength and reliance.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Ah, I really am a fortunate person.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino thought of that while crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Born to a gentle mother, raised in a loving environment‐‐and now being supported by such reliable friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sadness and suffering, but they didn't lose out to the great joy. Those feelings intertwined in her head caused her cry even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so‐‐an unknown period of time had passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino finally calmed down and wiped away her tears. Kaho, who had left the hospital room, had returned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, what's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! No, I just fell a little……I'm sorry I got the bed dirty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino stood back up while turning to face Kaho. In front of her Yoshino was supposed to be Yoshino's daughter Yoshie. She couldn't say that she regained her memories after seeing her old room again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, are you okay? Are there any injuries? Don't worry about the bed, I'll fix it later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry……and thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino bowed her head down‐‐and then widened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She noticed that Kaho was holding a large box under her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaho likely noticed from Yoshino's response. She walked towards Yoshino and placed the box on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. If Yoshino-chan ever came back, I would need to return this, so I've kept it all this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying so, she opened the lid.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐This is……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing what was within the box, Yoshino widened his eyes. Shidou and Natsumi also gave a similar expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was a natural response. After all, it was a rabbit puppet that looked exactly like Yoshinon.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yoshino, who had regained her past memories, immediately understood the identity of the puppet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, this is‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshinon……Junior."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshinon‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Junior!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Shidou and Natsumi let out a shared an astonished cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino nodded as she took the puppet out of the box.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking closely, one would find that it was not the exact same as Yoshinon. There was no eyepatch like Yoshinon and the ears were slightly dangling like a lop-eared rabbit.</p>
<p class="null-p">No doubt about it, this was a copy of Yoshino that was made for Nagisa, Yoshinon Junior.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaho breathed out a sigh, looking deeply moved while gently caressing Junior.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a doll that Yoshino-chan made to give to her mother. ……In the end, she was never able to deliver it after Nagisa-san passed away. ‐‐Yoshiechan, right? If it is alright, can you give this to Yoshino-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino eagerly nodded as she put Junior on her right hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, as Yoshinon and Junior were facing each other, she moved her right hand to let Junior speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Long time no see, Yoshinon. I want to see you all this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, as if to reply to this‐‐ "‐‐Yeah, Yoshinon as well!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon tightly hugged Junior.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterwards, Shidou carefully packed Junior in a bag and returned to the hospital lobby.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, thank you so much for the trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino apologetically spoke as she deeply bowed to Kaho. Her eyes were still a little red, but no more tears were seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, don't worry. I'm glad to have seen you too. ‐‐I'd also love to see Yoshino-chan next time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'll come visit you, so please let know when will be a good day for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……a-alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Kaho had said, Yoshino replied with an ambiguous laugh. While they had exchanged contact information with Kaho earlier, that meeting wouldn't be realized until they can prepare an image of a grown up Yoshino. ……Could something be done with the Realizer Manifestation Device? He would have to ask Kotori later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you again so much for the trouble. ‐‐Please excuse us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, see you later.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou and the other exchanged goodbyes with Kaho before leaving the hospital.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they didn't notice when they first arrived, the hospital was built on top of a long slope, allowing one a perfect view of the cityscape and horizon below. Looking at the surface of the water glisten from the sunlight, Shidou stretched his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐It's great, Yoshino. You remembered about your mom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino replied with a shy smile. Then, following her words, Yoshinon exaggeratingly folded her paws.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I feel refreshed. Seeing Junior again, hasn't Yoshinon upgraded again? Something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Yoshinon raised a fist up in the air as if performing shadow boxing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshinon was a second personality created to protect Yoshino's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino must have subconsciously shaped it in the image of her mother. Perhaps some changes were due for Yoshinon now that Yoshino recovered her memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, this way of thinking was a little too boorish. Yoshinon, as Nagisa's other self, has always been protecting Yoshino. In this respect, one could not help but‐‐regard it as beautiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I also remembered one more thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words were spoken as they were slowly going down the slope to the bus stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Remembered? What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐It was when <Phantom>appeared before me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou raised his eyebrows upon hearing Yoshino's words.</p>
<p class="null-p"><Phantom>, it was the codename which was given when the Spirit of Origin was hiding her true identity.</p>
<p class="null-p">She gave Sephira Crystals to humans in order to turn them into Spirits. Although some remember and some don't, she should have appeared to all of the former Spirits without exception.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mom stopped coming to see me. Because of that, I was lonely, lonely, crying all the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that my medical condition got worse and one night my chest hurt so much that it became difficult to breathe. ‐‐That's when, <Phantom>appeared in front of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou took in a small breathe as he lowered his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I heard that Mio-san turned us into Spirits in order to turn Shinji-san into an eternal existence. But‐‐if I hadn't met Mio-san then, I would have died."</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked up to the sky as she continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Becoming a Spirit indeed means a lot of hardship. I've encountered many sad things.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐I've also obtained more happiness and joy then that sadness. ‐‐I think. Although Mio-san intended to make us of my life, she allowed me to live longer in exchange."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt his words clog up. At that moment, Yoshino smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know much about Mio-san, so I don't if I'm correct. ‐‐But, if it was Reine-san whom I am familiar with, that's what I believe to be true."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Ah, that may be true."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou replied back to Yoshino with a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although no one knew what the truth was, if it was Reine‐‐it wouldn't be too surprising to imagine it like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right‐‐I almost forgot."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Yoshino ran down a few steps ahead and turned around to face them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshinon…..just for a bit, is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">After listening to Yoshino, Yoshinon gave an exaggerated nod. It looked as if she knew exactly what Yoshino wanted to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Yoshino took Yoshinon off from her left hand and held her body with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me formally introduce them to you‐‐mom."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, she turned Yoshinon to Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person is Natsumi-san. My‐‐most important friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Faced with that sudden shock, Natsumi's body couldn't help but start trembling. However, perhaps feeling impolite if she didn't say anything, she blushed as she nodded back to Yoshinon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……H-Hello. My name is Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it was impossible for Yoshinon to respond without Yoshino's left hand‐‐but Yoshino naturally understood this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, so that was it. Shidou remembered what Yoshino had said before coming here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino wanted to introduce her friends to her mother‐‐mother's other self. Formally. ‐‐While using her own words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, Yoshino turned to face Shidou. Perhaps, he will be introduced next. He coughed a little and straightened his posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Yoshino spoke with a slightly mischievous smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This person is Shidou-san. My‐‐most cherished person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those unexpected words, Shidou let out a surprised cry. Then, Yoshino continued on with a distressed look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even though it took courage to confess, he still hasn't given me a clear answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y, Y, Yoshino? That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly, there were additional attacks. Shidou was left dumbstruck.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, Shidou was confessed to by Yoshino over a year ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was during the moment Tohka was about to disappear‐‐and in the end nothing was left settled. He didn't expect she would bring it up again at this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou began to panic, Yoshino gave an amused laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, it doesn't matter Shidou-san. I just wanted to tease you a little. ‐‐After all, that was only for Tohka-san to tell the truth."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoshino……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But wait for me to grow bigger, by then‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh‐‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou asked again, but Yoshino didn't answer. She just loosened her bag and placed Yoshino back on her left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuha! Yoshinon has revived! So how was it Yoshino?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu‐‐secret."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino smiled as she placed her index finger against her lips. Yoshinon responded with "Eh?</p>
<p class="null-p">Tell me!" as she started pinching Yoshino's cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">While watching this, Natsumi covered her reddish face (while still having enough gaps in her fingers to peek through) and squeezed out her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yoshino……when did you become so mature……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, um……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to show agreement, Shidou also began to mumble out his words. He never would expect someone as innocent as Yoshino to play a fool out of him like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">……That was probably the reason why she took off Yoshinon. Shidou felt the mysterious impression of watching a child become self-reliant.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if he thought more about this, it made sense. Nearly a year had passed since the final battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">People grow up, especially if it was a girl in her adolescent phase like Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was left speechless. ‐‐How much had he grown since a year ago?</p>
<p class="null-p">(‐‐After all, that was only for Tohka-san to tell the truth.) Yoshino's words pierce through his chest like a needle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino had indeed grown. But it didn't start just now. Since that time a year ago, Yoshino had been more mature than Shidou. Knowing Tohka would disappear, she was much more mature than Shidou and Tohka who were trying to hide their grief.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Thinking over this past year, although Shidou had been forcing himself to accept Tohka's disappearance, he had been deliberately avoiding any information connected to Tohka. It must be because even if his mind understood it, he was still afraid to accept the fact that Tohka was gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">……How pathetic, it took seeing Yoshino's courage and growth for Shidou to finally realize it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Shidou-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly hearing Yoshino's voice, Shidou felt his shoulders shake slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's the matter, Yoshino?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really appreciate today. ‐‐Thanks to Shidou-san and Natsumi-san's help, I was able to see my mother again."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that said, Yoshino expressed her gratitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, if anything……I need to thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino gave a confused look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino didn't say anything special. However, Yoshino's actions today‐‐it wasn't an exaggeration to say that it was a push forward for Shidou who was currently stuck in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐first, he needed to start by knowing more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Things about Tohka. Things about Spacequakes. Things about Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐It was possible to move forward by knowing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shidou……san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What happened to you just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino and Natsumi questioned while slanting their heads. Shidou shook his head, saying, "It's nothing" while turning to overlook the sea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐There's a park in the middle of the hill. It's a bit late, but it is still bright out. I've prepared a special lunch for this trip."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou spoke while having the same expression as if figuring something out. Yoshino and Natsumi exchanged glances before smiling and nodding.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">March. The coldness of winter began to fall as the breath of spring could be felt everywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino was visiting Natsumi's room in the same apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, Natsumi's room was right next door to Yoshino's room. Originally, Natsumi chose the farthest room on the top floor because of not wanting to interact much with others. However, she seemed to change her mind after the final battle one year ago and decided to move here.</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as the chime was pressed, the rattling sound of footsteps could be heard as the door was being opened. Natsumi, with her disheveled hair and cluttered room clothes soon appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Welcome……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi-san……isn't it okay if you don't have to be too urgent?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino said with a smile, Natsumi pacified her breathing as she vigorously shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, someone like me can't make Yoshino wait……even if you don't bother to come, if you come to talk with me I'll need to respond in kind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. We are neighbors, so don't feel so restrained."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Neighbors……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino said that, Natsumi's face turned red for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she soon immediately responded to her invitation to Yoshino.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to keep you standing out there. Come on in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, pardon the intrusion."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino whispered as she took off her shoes and entered Natsumi's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh……is black tea okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Thank you very much for the hospitality."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I should be honored……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi muttered to herself but the second half of what she said wasn't quite audible.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino sat waiting on the sofa, Natsumi came over with tea and snacks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino once again expressed her gratitude as Natsumi sat facing her with shoulders still shrinking back from being nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……So, what's going on today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐that's right. Natsumi-san, are you free during the next day off?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Free."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an immediately reply. Yoshino couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what are you going to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. Actually, after that day, Sumida-san sent me an email telling me the location of my mom's grave. So I was thinking about going there the next day off. And I want mom to see Junior. So……if it's okay, I would want Natsumi-san to go with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I think it's boring to visit someone's grave, so we can't force you either."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahaha, Yoshinon spoke with a light laugh. Then, Natsumi responded by exaggeratingly shaking her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I want to go. Because I'm Yoshino's f, f, f……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi was blushing so hard that it seemed steam was coming out of her ears. Finally, she squeezed out her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Friend……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! That's right!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino replied with a smile. Natsumi felt a "Bon!" sound as smoke came out her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'm in your care. The location is near that city, so it might be a little</p>
<p class="null-p">far……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem at all. ……Did you already speak to Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not yet……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Yoshino said that, Natsumi raised her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During days off, the chances of other girls being after him is quite high. I heard he was even going to deliver food to Kurumi's place today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's right……well then, just a message first……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino took out her smartphone, tapping the screen just as she was about to send a message to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐at that very moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu‐‐‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of a disturbing alarm echoed in the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…..!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Spacequake alarm……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both Yoshino and Natsumi held their breaths as they exchanged astonished looks with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why is there an alarm……? Shouldn't there be no more Spirits?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know……but anyway, for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoshino nervously tightened her fist as she said that. Natsumi strongly nodded as if to show understanding for her intentions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them quickly left the room and headed to <Fraxinus>to confirm the situation.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5: Itsuka Kotori</p>
<p class="null-p">My first encounter with Shidou was when Shidou was adopted into the Itsuka household.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, I was a kid then, so I don't remember it very well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually, for a while, I spent time without knowing that Shidou was my adopted brother. My gentle, kind, and favorite brother, to me Shidou was like this. At the time, I felt that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐My world changed six years ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I became a Spirit by the hands of <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">In retrospect, I'm sure I was chosen in order to grant the protection of <Camael>to Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, it's a vexing story. Moreover, the person in question selfishly disappears before I can raise a complaint. Really‐‐a person that lets people feel that nothing can be done about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, I became a Spirit. And also around the same time I was scouted by <Ratatoskr>and given the position of commander to prepare for the arrival of other Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was rescued by Shidou and began preparing to help Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Because after all, I am Onii-chan's little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt very satisfied and proud of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, among everyone else today, I've spent more time with Shidou than anyone else and know more about Shidou than anyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I suddenly noticed one thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Me being a little sister is both a source of pride and at the same time‐‐it's almost like a curse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Closer than anyone else, but too close.</p>
<p class="null-p">Presumably when Shidou falls in love, I won't be able to come in.</p>
<p class="null-p">But. If perhaps‐‐Shidou hadn't been adopted into our household.</p>
<p class="null-p">Would both of us have met in a different way?</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Thump, thump, the sound of his heartbeat felt excessively noisy.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heartbeat was racing so fiercely that it felt like his ribs were about to be broken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, this feeling must be coming from the trembling fear. In fact, the tremendous pressure generated by this mysterious girl standing in front of him was to the extent that he didn't need an apparatus to measure the goosebumps coursing through his skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Primal fear, the intuition of death, every fiber of his instincts strongly screamed about the overwhelming gap between them. Run away now. An absolute predator was in front of him‐‐but Shidou didn't escape.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps his feet were so frightened that he was paralyzed, but above all else‐‐he couldn't look away from this girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐What was this feeling?</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was attacked by a strange visual sensation as his heartbeat rang like an alarm bell. An unknown existence, it was a girl who he should have never known. But why? Shidou couldn't help but feel that he had met this girl once before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……U, a‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the girl who broke this stalemate. While leaking out a small groan, she slowly raised the arm cladded with her claw above her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon realizing the girl's intentions, Shidou held his breath as he frantically tried to escape from this spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's hand swung down as the sound of even the wind being cut down resonated.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐At that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">The surrounding scenery became displaced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not understanding what had just happened, Shidou let out a dull cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">But he soon immediately understood. The roads, houses, sidewalk, trees, vehicles, everything in front of the girl‐‐was smoothly cut apart like tofu and collapsed onto the ground with a heavy sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">And this phenomenon didn't just occur right front of this girl. The sounds of collapse gradually extend off into the distance, stirring up a round of smoke and dust.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt his breathing grow suffocated. After all, the cityscape in the direction of where the girl had swung her claw was cleanly sliced apart to a few kilometers away.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Shidou had retreated just a few seconds later, he surely would have become a smooth cross section just like the street.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A, a, a‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl raised her arm above her head for a second time, wildly swinging her claw for a second and third time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each time the cityscape extended beyond the girl's line of sight was beautifully cut.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You've got to be kidding……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that Shidou has lost <Camael>'s protection, even the tiniest blow would be fatal. Shidou lowered his body while trying to flee from this place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, Shidou couldn't find it meaningful to try and find some distance from this girl. As long as that girl swung her claw, all the scenery within that extension line would be reduced to rubble.</p>
<p class="null-p">The most important thing was to not stand in front of that girl's gaze. So inevitably, Shidou decided to circle around this girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Aa, a, aa……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After an unknown number of attacks, the girl raised her hand to the heavens.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately, the huge claw disappeared. In its steed, one of the ten swords floating around the girl was taken into the girl's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fifth sword from the left was a great sword boasting a thick blade just like a battle axe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl roared like a beast as she inserted the sword onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His body cowered as he reflexively let out a scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the girl at the center, cracks radiating from the earth spread out‐‐as flames burst out just like a volcano.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, the surrounding area transformed into a burning hell. Fortunately, Shidou wasn't caught in the fire, but inhaling the diffused fumes caused him to violently cough.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this was far from over. The girl grabbed the eighth sword‐‐a spiraling sword swirling like a tornado, and swung it down with great strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the girl as the starting point, a tremendous gale was set off, trapping the flames that had erupted and extending them out to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gah……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a human being, it was impossible for Shidou resist this rampage. He was helplessly blown to the sky and scorched by the rising flames.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐A stuffed animal thrown into the washing machine probably felt like this. His vision grew absurdly shaky as useless thoughts plundered his mind. His body was unable to freely move. He couldn't breathe. Only the torture of the flames' heat afflicting his entire body was clearly engraved onto his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this situation didn't last long. Shidou was thrown out of the sky with that momentum, but after experiencing a strange floating sensation for a few seconds, his body landed on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ga……fu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of being thrown in an unnatural posture, he wasn't even able to cushion the blow. His vision flickered on and off. It was difficult to tell where exactly his body was hurting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was still being conscious at this moment a fluke or terrible misfortune? For a brief moment, such thoughts crossed his mind‐‐but Shidou immediately judged it to be the former.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, wounds covered his entire body. Indeed, he was pushed into a desperate corner. But Shidou still hasn't lost consciousness yet. He could still think. It was too early. It was too early to give up‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">However, faint footsteps resonated as if to completely trample down on Shidou's hopes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was approaching step by step closer to Shidou who had collapsed face up on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">A hoarse voice leaked out from his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">A mysterious girl was standing in the background of the sky that was transitioning to nighttime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was left puzzled by the mysterious feeling taking control of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Confronted by the monster that had just injured him, Shidou felt horrified and desperate‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐He thought that she was beautiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aa, a……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl held the hilt of the floating sword as if to sever Shidou's thoughts. ‐‐The Tenth Sword.</p>
<p class="null-p">The biggest sword that released the most ominous sense of intimidation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou felt an unfathomable feeling as he watched himself be lifted up by this girl. It felt as if time was being stretched and the entire world was in slow motion. ‐‐Ah, I remember this impression. His brain, experiencing the intuition of death, was examining his memories in detail in order to discover a way to survive from his past experiences so far.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, he didn't feel that it would be useful for him right now. The reason why he was able to survive so far was due to the power of the Spirits dwelling in his body. Without that now, this phenomenon was just a revolving lantern. (soumatou, also known as the revolving lantern, is often related to the flashback phenomenon before death according to Asian superstitions.) But that wasn't all bad. As his consciousness dimed, Shidou thought. He could recall everyone's faces even though it was just before death. Various scenes appeared and disappeared within his heart. ‐‐When he was adopted into Kotori's family. His first meeting with Origami. When he was almost killed by Kurumi. And also‐‐ the first encounter with that girl he could never forget.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……,‐‐Toh, ka‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking back to that memory, Shidou felt his voice unconsciously leak out from his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">A small whisper that should have dissipated with the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">A thin monologue that no one will ever hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐‐‐,‐‐, A, a‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why? At that moment, the expression of the girl who was about to swing her sword slightly changed, as emotions stirred her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As his consciousness stretched out, Shidou gazed at her behaving strangely.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't figure out what just happened. The girl who was supposed to have absolute power was hesitating. Shidou couldn't understand why.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, are……"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Suddenly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very next moment, just as he was in the middle of saying something, Shidou opened his eyes wide in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt a strange floating feeling wrap around his entire body. The scenery reflected in his view had completely changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou thought for a moment that he had arrived in heaven, but‐‐that wasn't it.</p>
<p class="null-p">What spread out before his eyes were neither a land of clouds nor a rainbow bridge, but rather it was the interior of a ship that was composed of rigid straight lines.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Shidou! Are you okay, Shidou!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that sound above his head, Shidou leaked out a small whisper.</p>
<p class="null-p">While holding his swaying head, he was somehow able to capture the appearance of the voice's owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ko, tori……"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Standing in front of Shidou was his little sister who had her hair tied in black ribbons‐‐Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, he understood. Just before Shidou could be killed by that mysterious girl, he was recovered immediately by <Fraxinus>'s transfer device.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwwaa, you were almost done in, Boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">After replying to Kotori, familiar faces and voices appeared in Shidou's view. ‐‐Origami and Nia were looking down at Shidou with a worried look.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, that wasn't all. Behind them he could see other girls. Apparently, they had all been recovered by <Fraxinus>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, aah……sorry, you saved me, Kotori."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou replied in a hoarse voice, Kotori finally let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Really, I could feel the years of my life go by in a flash. It is entirely your fault for acting so rash……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking closely, her face was pale and there were huge beads of sweat on her forehead. It seems that he had made her worry a lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Sorry. But I didn't expect there would be a Spacequake so soon……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I'm really ashamed pertaining to that point."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Maria who, sitting nearby the captain's seat, responded to Shidou's voice. She looked to his side with a rare expression of dread.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The prediction of the occurrence of the Spacequake, based on fluctuations in space, was certainly ten minutes later. ‐‐But in actually, the Spacequake occurred earlier than expected. It was as if the wall of space itself was broken."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The analysis was similar to the intuition Shidou learned while being on the field. Shidou frowned as he looked at the bridge's main surveillance screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">The screen displayed the girl tyrannically abusing her overwhelming power. She didn't seem to care that Shidou was there or not as she continued her mindless destruction. With her at the epicenter, Tenguu City was reduced to ruins in an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if a beast was rampaging in a chaotic manner. There was no purpose or will, just a tyrannical king acquainting the world with her existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐seeing her like this, Shidou felt his breathing suffocate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was it? The look she gave as she roared.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐She looked, so very sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was staring at the main monitor, Kotori raised her voice to regain his attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please get medical treatment for Shidou first. Kawagoe, Nakatsugawa! Get Shido to the medical office!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Kotori's instructions, members of the <Fraxinus>crew, <Bad Marriage>Kawagoe and <Dimension Breaker>Nakatsugawa began preparing a stretcher. Seeing this, Shidou tried to get up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? No, you don't have to go that far‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Kotori stabbed his body with her finger. Suddenly, a severe pain spread throughout Shidou's entire body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh……gu……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Like I told you. You don't have <Camael>'s protection anymore. It should be expected that injuries won't heal if left alone. ……If left alone, do you really want die!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori sharpened her eyes and spoke. Shidou apologized while recognizing that he had been too naïve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Aah……sorry……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, Shidou-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kawagoe and Nakatsugawa urged Shidou while laying out the stretcher. Shidou moved his body to the stretcher with their help.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori looked towards them while speaking to Maria.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐We must develop countermeasures as soon as possible. Maria, please collect as much information as possible about that mysterious existence."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maria gave a brief reply while saluting. Immediately, the other girls who heard those words also raised their voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori. We also want to help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. Muku and the others were originally Spirits. It may prove useful."</p>
<p class="null-p">Origami and Mukuro made an appeal as they clenched their fists with a determined look. In response to this, Kotori faintly raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm grateful, but I don't want to involve you guys as much as possible. Now that your Reiryoku has disappeared, everyone was finally able to obtain a peaceful life‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Why not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it was Maria who interrupted Kotori's proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"While I agree with Kotori's opinion, the target this time is too unknown. The possibility of getting ideas that we don't have shouldn't be useless."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that opinion was also justifiable. Despite making a bitter face, Kotori finally relented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It can't be helped. But I'm only asking you to lend your wisdom as a reference. If you make a mistake, you won't be able to participate in the operation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls all nodded in unison.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou was being transferred to the medical office while watching this scene.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Treated by the Medical Realizer, Shidou headed for the briefing room where the former Spirit girls had already gathered there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Including Kotori, there was Origami, Nia, Kurumi, Yoshino, Mukuro, Natsumi, Kaguya, Yuzuru, and one more person lined up at the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Darling! Are you alright now!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as Shidou entered the room, that one more person raised her voce.</p>
<p class="null-p">A tall presence with hair cut in a princess style and a voice that resonated beautifully just like a silver bell. It was the former Spirit and idol, Izayoi Miku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm fine. It may be strange to say this now, but the Medical Realizer is really incredible. I feel even better than before I got injured."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying, that he showed off stretching his shoulders. Seeing this, everyone gave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐We've been waiting for you, Shidou. I'll start the meeting now. Please sit down."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, who was sitting in the innermost seat, spoke while resting her elbows on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou nodded in response and sat down in the vacant seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now if you will, Maria."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori made her request, Maria, who was standing next to her, snapped her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately following her movements, the center of the elliptical table displayed an image.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this, Shidou lightly raised his brow.</p>
<p class="null-p">The image displayed an urban area now resembling scorched earth and the mysterious girl sleeping while hugging her knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐As you can see, after the encounter with Shidou, the subject entered a dormant state after destroying part of the surrounding area. As if being put to ease of not seeing any other creatures with her eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about the AST?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If the Spacequake alarm sounded, the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force's AST would be dispatched. Shidou asked while slanting his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They were fighting just now……but of course it wasn't an opponent they could handle. They fled on the spot. Fortunately, no casualties occurred."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori helplessly shrugged her shoulders. ……Well, that was a situation that could be fully anticipated. The power felt from that girl was so overwhelming.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately afterwards, Origami narrowed her eyes and stared at Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I have one thing to confirm. Is it a Spirit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing this, everyone fell silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that was to be expected. That question was on everyone's mind but no one could come up with a clear answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori opened her mouth after let out a long sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……One year ago, the Sephira Crystal of the Spirit of Origin, Mio, disappeared. If you define Spirit as an existence that has been given Reiryoku by Mio, then the answer would be no."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kotori continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is being observed from the subject is clearly a Reiha response. Therefore, <Ratatoskr>has temporarily decided that the subject is a Spirit and given her the codename <Beast>."</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Beast>……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, that name seemed like something appropriate for her. …..Well, he didn't know if it could be regarded as a proper name for a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou was thinking that over, Miku placed her finger against her chin while making a confused face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……although I don't quite understand, but are you saying that this Spirit is born from a source other than Mio-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's impossible to tell……to be honest. After all, we don't have a sample case of a Spirit being born from a source outside from Mio."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori shrugged as she replied to Miku's question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Reiha response emanating from <Beast>is very similar to the wavelength of a conventional Spirit. However, it's unclear whether this means Mio's power has remained somewhere in this world or if Spirits will have the same composition regardless of their origin."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, there's no way to test it without a comparison……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi nodded in agreement to Kotori's words. But then, her eyebrows twitched as if coming up with something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Perhaps, and I'm saying perhaps. The Spirit crossed through time using a bullet from</p>
<p class="null-p"><Zafkiel>……could that be possible? After all Sephira Crystals existed up until a year ago. Ah, and I also remember it. A bullet that could be used to travel to the future……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Ara, ara."</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing that hypothesis, that voice came from Kurumi, the original host for the Angel of time <Zafkiel>. She narrowed her eyes with keen interest and stroked her cheeks with her fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's an interesting theory. Certainly if that's the case, you may be able to make a Spirit appear in this era where Sephira Crystals are gone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……So. Do you have any idea, Kurumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori coldly stared at Kurumi. Kurumi shook her head with exaggerating movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfortunately, I don't remember shooting the Eleventh Bullet <Yud Aleph>on such a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐How about Shidou-san and Natsumi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi said while looking towards Shidou and Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, her intentions were immediately understood. In the past, Shidou had sealed Kurumi's Reiryoku and Natsumi, while incomplete, could use <Haniel>to imitate the powers of other Angels. In other words, there was the possibility of both of them using <Zafkiel>.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I don't remember doing that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Me too. In the first place I was only able to copy abilities that I've seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wouldn't using</p>
<p class="null-p"><Zafkiel>decrease my lifespan? Even if I copied it, I would never want to use it……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Kurumi shrugged while turning her eyes towards Kotori. Kotori seemed to think that this answer was expected as she nodded slightly in agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">However at that moment, Kurumi curved the corners lips into a smile as if finding this amusing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Well, if it was the Twelfth Bullet <Yud Bet>shot rather than the Eleventh Bullet <Yud Aleph>, it would be understandable for the current me to not know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What did you say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori sharpened her eyes in astonishment. On the other hand, Kurumi let out a little giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Twelfth Bullet <Yud Bet>, a secret of <Zafkiel>that was paired with <Yud Aleph>, the bullet that could send the target to the future. It was Kurumi's secret trump card that could send the target back to the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">Phrasing it like that could only mean one thing. Seemingly aware of this meaning, Kotori frowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you saying that the future Kurumi sent <Beast>to the past?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. no. Needless to say, I have no intention of doing that. After all, I don't have that sort of power right now. It's just‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kurumi continued on while spinning her finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The future is unpredictable. For some reason, the power of the Spirits was restored and I dispatched this target to the past‐‐can anyone deny that possibility?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What are you trying to say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori's expression oozed tension, Kurumi simply shook her head and lowered her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't be on so high of alert. It is unlikely that this happens; I just can say that it's not impossible‐‐it's just a possibility I am trying to explain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori silently folded her arms while making a difficult face. Certainly, Kurumi's opinion was disturbing, but she did just offer a possibility in order to solve the problem. ……Well, she couldn't deny that her tone and manner were certainly provocative.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou deliberately coughed to both clear out his throat and lighten the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well anyway……while we don't know her true colors, isn't her being a Spirit all the same?</p>
<p class="null-p">So in that case isn't there one thing that we have to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, the girls in the briefing room narrowed their eyes and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Indeed it was an unidentified opponent. Indeed it was a dangerous Spirit. But for Shidou, Shidou has always attempted to converse with them first. To phrase it in another way, the girls lined up now were also once such opponents.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that was the case, what they should do this time will not change. Shidou turned to look to Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐It's up to me to make this girl fall in love. Kotori, please support me." Ah, that's right. This was Shidou's task and mission.</p>
<p class="null-p">At moments like this, Kotori would laugh and shrug, saying "I didn't expect you to be capable of saying that". It would then come down to those words. ‐‐Alright, let's being our war (date) ‐‐ "‐‐‐‐, No."</p>
<p class="null-p">However.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori uttered that word against all expectations. Shidou couldn't help but stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh? What did you just say, Kotori?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I said no. I don't agree with you. This will be left to <Ratatoskr>."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori said sternly. Faced with this unexpected response, Shidou's expression grew more confused.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you talking about Kotori? What are you going to do? You were the one that said only I can seal the power of the Spirits!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori kept her gloomy gaze as Shidou made his appeal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Then, let me ask you, is the power to seal Spirits still present within Shidou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"With Mio's disappearance, the power of the Spirits also disappeared. ‐‐Then what about Shidou's power which was given by Mio during reconstruction? Did it also disappear along with the power of the Spirits? Or is it still woven into Shidou's existence?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The answer is‐‐I don't know, right. There's no more Reiryoku that can be sealed, so there's no way to verify it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori continued while shaking her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……And even if you still have the power to seal, we don't know if it will work for this Spirit.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, she may be a Spirit born from a Sephira Crystal that wasn't derived from Mio.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Faced with an uncertain existence, I can't give you the task of dealing with the Spirit, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori coldly spoke. Nevertheless, Shidou didn't see any other alternative means. He clenched his fist while raising his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Indeed, I didn't think it over. It is different from what's been done before and it's uncertain I can help. ‐‐But if there's the slightest possibility of the sealing working, there's no reason not to try it! It doesn't matter if it doesn't work! Let me try‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Who was the person that almost died just a few minutes ago!" Kotori slammed her fist against the table to interrupt Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls all trembled seeing the usually calm Kotori be so enraged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing everyone's response, Kotori lightly placed her hand against her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Sorry. I'm disqualified from being commander. ……I'll go cool my head a little. Everyone take a break."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori got up and left the briefing room with some staggering steps.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Nushi-sama‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Mukuro said worriedly while staring blankly at Kotori's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou said "it is fine" to reassure everyone and then silently stared at the door where Kotori disappeared into.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After returning to the captain's room onboard <Fraxinus>, Kotori walked towards the office chair. Then, she grabbed the cushion and threw it against the wall at full strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a dull sound, the cushion fell onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐As the commander of <Ratatoskr>, she even messed up in front of everyone and even lost control of her temper. Kotori heavily sighed. But rather than feeling better, she felt even more humiliated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori picked up the cushion and fell onto the ground while holding it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Kotori also understand that it wasn't the time to do such a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐An unidentified Spirit that suddenly appeared. That power could be described with a single word: threat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was now dormant after destroying everything within her field of vision, it was impossible to expect her to stay that way forever. If such a creature went on a rampage with destruction as her only goal, then it would only take a few days to completely change the scenery of the earth. Before that happened, they had to plan out the countermeasures as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in Kotori's hands the means to deal with this Spirit‐‐no, such a thing no longer existed in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, <Ratatoskr>was an organization built with the goal of protecting Spirits. An act such as annihilation by force was not allowed, not to mention they lacked the combat power to use those means against the Spirit in the first place. Under the current circumstances, Ellen Matters was the most powerful person in <Ratatoskr>, but it couldn't be denied that her proficiency with the Realizer has declined after her memory loss.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, then their last hope would be Shidou. She didn't know if he retained the ability to seal Spirits after Mio's disappearance, but there was no other method left. As Shidou had said, they had to risk it all in this gamble.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori understood that.</p>
<p class="null-p">The knowledge‐‐was there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kotori silently felt her head creak.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the back of her mind, the scene she once saw resurged. Six years ago. An old memory. ‐‐The scene of when Kotori was turned into a Spirit by <Phantom>.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, who was too young, couldn't control her power, causing a fire to spread and sparking a huge conflagration. Then‐‐even Shidou who had come to help Kotori was almost killed. Shidou falling down. The smell of burnt flesh. Even after six years, that nightmarish scene could still be remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although at that time, by letting Shidou seal her Reiryoku, she as able to transfer <Camael>'s healing power and he ended up safe and sound‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">But now that the power of the Spirits have disappeared from this world, letting Shidou respond to that Spirit would be nothing more than pushing him into circumstances where he might really die.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……, ……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori felt her heartbeat speeding up. Her breathing became messy as sweat gradually poured out from her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't just that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was accidentally sniped by Origami.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he entered Yoshino's ice boundary.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he was stabbed in the chest by Ellen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without the power of the Spirits, Shidou would be dead.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐It was her fault for allowing him to act so recklessly. After losing <Camael>, Kotori understood this again. She squeezed the black ribbons tying her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was gift from Shidou for Kotori's birthday‐‐a switch for Kotori to turn into her strong self.</p>
<p class="null-p">By wearing this, Kotori adopted a stronger mindset, transforming from a cute little sister to a stern commander. ‐‐To endure the responsibilities and fulfill the duties of being a commander of <Ratatoskr>, she must be strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, to be more precise it was definitely because‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐The little sister wearing the white ribbons couldn't bear sending Shidou to the battlefield, so she need to create her commander self (another me) for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was nothing praiseworthy. The strong self she had desperately created was further proof of Kotori's weak heart. Faced with this current situation, Kotori was forced to realize this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, but it wasn't just that. She thought again about this current situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">I must be‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Kotori's shoulders trembled as she raised her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was simple. The door to her office was being knocked on.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, she thought <Beast>had begun moving‐‐but that wasn't right. In that case, Maria would broadcast an emergency notification. No, it was more likely that someone was worried by how she left and came to check up on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't keep letting everyone continue to see her act so uncouth. Kotori hurriedly stood up and corrected her posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐The door is open. Please come in."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori said that, the office door opened‐‐and the person knocking appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Ge."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing who it was, Kotori made gave an unpleasant expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing there was the person that Kotori wanted to see the least right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..A ge is all I get? What does ge even mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The person there said with a smile‐‐Shidou helplessly shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori slightly shook her head, reentering her rational mindset as she turned to face him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? I don't need to be worried about you while trying to think up a solution. I'll be back soon so take a break."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori pretended to be calm while speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Needless to say, that was a lie. She didn't have the slightest idea of a countermeasure for</p>
<p class="null-p"><Beast>.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the commander had the important task of being in charge of the operation and couldn't allow the people working together to feel uneasy. The commander's uncertainty could easily spread to the subordinates and disturb the combat plan. Therefore, no matter how critical the situation, Kotori wasn't allowed to speaking discouragingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou took in a deep breath before mumbling out his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It was a few years ago. When I was bedridden from a cold, I happened to just run out medicine. So Kotori ran out to buy some for me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't understand what Shidou as trying to say. But Shidou continued to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"On the way to the pharmacy, there was a yard with a huge dog. That's why I told you not to overdo it, but Kotori kept saying it was alright. Obviously, it couldn't be helped that you were scared."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What are going on about now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori asked, Shidou looked directly into Kotori's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if he was seeing though Kotori's strong façade.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You look just like then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori held her breath at Shidou's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Shidou continue to speak in a quiet tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Kotori is amazing. You're younger than me but still an outstanding commander. I was able to fight because of you. I was able to stand in front of the Spirits because of you. ……Everyone is counting on you. So I know you have to be strong in front of everyone. But‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Stop."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's voice was as faint as a mosquito. Shidou probably wasn't able to hear it as he continued in a gentle voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In front of me, you don't have to act strong in front of me anymore. Because I am‐‐your older brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those words in her ears‐‐Kotori sharpened her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Calm down, she had to keep telling herself to calm down. The commander must be calm. Don't commit the same foolish mistake as before.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she couldn't stand it. She couldn't suppress it. It was the feeling of slowly being engulfed by the surging flames of emotions burning her heart. Kotori felt her throat choking from the violent passion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because……? So what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh‐‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since I am your little sister, will you stop messing around? Since I am your little sister, do you want me to just watch you go off and die? Because I am your little sister, are you telling me to just silently watch you get killed…..!?" Kotori shouted out her emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't joke around! What the hell…..! I thought it was finally peaceful……! I though Shidou will finally not be hurt! Why did that Spirit have to……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She understood this wasn't what a commander should be doing. But once she started, she couldn't stop. Her words poured out like a broken dam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I‐‐I don't want Shidou to die! I don't want to see Shidou get hurt anymore! I can't bare it anymore letting Shidou feel pain again! Because I. I‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tears spilled out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I‐‐love Shidou……"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Ah, this was the worst.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori felt repulsed by the words that she had blurted out and felt driven by a desire to go mad.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐What was she trying to say? Regret filled her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The words themselves weren't false. Kotori loves Shidou. Surely, in a different sense than what little sisters generally hold for their older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right. There was another meaning of Kotori wearing the black ribbons.</p>
<p class="null-p">When wearing the black ribbons, Kotori called him Shidou rather than Oniichan.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a key element in shaping her strong self as a commander.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, deeper than that‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori wanted him to view her as a woman rather than as a little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">…..But even so, she should have considered the timing. Letting her emotions run wild, confessing while passionately crying, there must be a limit to her shame. Even if there was no blood relationship, Kotori was Shidou's little sister. Generally speaking, she would be rejected.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why Kotori intended to hide this feeling within her heart. Even if she were to confess, she decided it would be in the ideal situation. It should be like that, but‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Kotori‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Shidou widened his eyes, he was still speaking in a calm tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori's entire body began to tremble. She swept her hair and continued to speak defiantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Is that bad? Isn't it normal? I can't help but say that to someone I love…..! I also don't understand! Ah, love, love! So I don't want you to die! It has nothing to do with being the commander of <Ratatoskr>! I‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, at that moment, the words she could bring herself to stop came to a halt.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason was very simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Shidou come over‐‐and then he gently hugged Kotori's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………Kotori."</p>
<p class="null-p">While hugging Kotori, Shidou once again called out her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reacting to that voice, her body trembled. Feeling the affection from the bottom of Kotori's heart, Shidou increase the strength in his arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐It would be a lie to say that he wasn't surprised by Kotori's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if he were to say he hadn't noticed Kotori's feelings so far‐‐the answer would also be no.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as Kotori tried to conceal it, he could somehow feel it from her subtle actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, of course Shidou and Kotori are siblings. Shidou's misunderstanding may have come from excessive self-consciousness. Or even if that's true, it could also likely be from the confusion of adolescence. So Shidou avoided mentioning this.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, no matter how he tried to spin the words, he would need to confront this. Surely, that was his responsibility as an older brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Thank you, Kotori. Thank you for worrying about my safety. I‐‐also love Kotori the most."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what he had said, Kotori felt her shoulders tremble once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Kotori huffed from her nose as she regained composure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Anyway, are you going to add as a sister again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori complained while looking dissatisfied. ……It seems she still remembered when he sealed her Reiryoku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, maybe so. No‐‐I think that's it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Shidou said that, Kotori silently bit her lips. A subtle force was being transmitted through her arms. It seemed she was clenching her fists. ‐‐As if to withstand the pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Kotori look like this, Shidou felt his chest tighten.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't Shidou's intention to hurt Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐‐even then he couldn't lie to her. If he did that, Kotori would undoubtedly be even more hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, Shidou continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">He unabashedly told her the thoughts in his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I never had a serious lover before, so part of it comes from my imagination……but I feel that my feelings for Kotori are different from that." Yes. That was Shidou's honest feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou loved Kotori from the bottom of his heart‐‐but it was definitely not the same feelings as for a lover.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing this, Kotori lowered her head in shame. He felt something warm as Kotori pressed her face into his stomach. It didn't take long to realize that this was caused by Kotori's tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou continued on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, he had said the truth. But besides that, there was another thought that lingered in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Who decided that my feelings for my little sister are inferior to that of a lover?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori held her breath and raised her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, after a while, she took in a deep breath while thinking over what Shidou had just said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What is that? Wouldn't you get beaten up if you said that to your lover?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was dumbfounded‐‐but as if the knots in her stomach were being undone, she replied back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha……probably. But I really think so, so it can't be helped? I can't control my own feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Kotori became silent for a while, she tapped Shidou's back her fingers while letting out a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Thank you. I'm much calmer now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Un."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou gave a brief reply, relaxing the strength of his arms and letting go of Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she wiped away her tears with her sleeves and looked at him with redden eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Sorry. I was a little upset. But don't forget‐‐what you said. …… Because what I said wasn't a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou nodded affirmatively and then scratched his cheek to hide his embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um……how to say it. Although surprised‐‐if you ask me if I was happy or not, I was definitely happy……I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I-Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori looked away as her cheeks blushed red. Despite calming down for a bit, it seemed that the feelings of embarrassment quickly resurfaced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, she couldn't be embarrassed forever. After coughing a few times to clear her throat, she regained her composure before speaking again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……W-Well, anyway, that's why. I don't want to see Shidou in any more</p>
<p class="null-p">danger. I can't place Shidou in front of a Spirit now that you've lost <Camael>'s protection. ……Do you understand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing what Kotori had said, Shidou fell silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">He painfully understood Kotori's feelings. If he were in the same position as</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, he probably would have said the same thing. But‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kotori."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori narrowed her eyes slightly and turned her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou looked into her eyes before continuing to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐I don't have the protection of <Camael>right now. But if I were a man who ran away from a Spirit for this reason‐‐would you still love me Kotori?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I still would. Don't look down on me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I-I see. Then, um……sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">The immediate answer caused Shidou to lower his head in apology. While still blushing, there wasn't any more doubt in Kotori's expression. It probably felt that way after just having confessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shidou couldn't back down now. He cleared his throat before trying again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's by all means……no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I won't allow it. It's too dangerous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But is there any other effective countermeasures?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……it does look it that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori spoke while lowering the pitch of her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Kotori was like how she was before, she would have continued to stubbornly refuse to admit that. Shidou was a little happy, feeling that Kotori had finally opened her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Surely, as Kotori says, I don't know if I still have the ability to seal a Spirit. And without</p>
<p class="null-p"><Camael>'s protection, it's certainly more dangerous to stand in front of a Spirit. I also don't want to die."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Then, we'll find another way‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou interrupted Kotori as he continued to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking it over carefully, the reason why I started conversing with the Spirits wasn't because I had the power to seal the power of the Spirits or because I had the blessings of <Camael>.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Well, while those two are important, when I first met Tohka, I never even knew about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um……sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Kotori pouted her lips a little at this touchy subject, Shidou slightly shook his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it is fine. Thanks to that, I realized what was important."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Important……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah‐‐the reason I started conversing with the Spirits was only for the reason of saving the Spirits."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou expressed his determination, Kotori silently groaned. She frowned while shaking her head in disapproval.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Although it's a theory in hindsight, all of the Spirits so far were chosen by Mio to give their Reiryoku to Shidou. No matter how terrifying the opponent was, there's always the slight possibility of victory. ‐‐But, <Beast>is different from the previous Spirits. In the first place, I'm not sure she can even communicate properly. It would be like going to die in vain."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori gave him the reasoning behind her protests. But Shidou raised his hand to counter argue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It won't be like that……I think. Although it was brief, I successfully talk to <Beast>. Moreover, that person at that moment‐‐stopped attacking for a split second."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing what Shidou had said, Kotori couldn't help but be at a loss for words. Kotori likely also saw it from the monitor screen. The moment she was about to land the finishing blow to Shidou, she revealed a little bit of hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So……are you going to stand in front of a Spirit on such vague grounds?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. When I talked to Beast that was the conclusion I reached."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori fell silent. That was certainly true. After all, at this stage, the only person to have directly encountered <Beast>was Shidou.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, it's a sloppy way of phrasing it. But‐‐that is all there it to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou continued while staring into Kotori's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Two years ago‐‐when I first met Tohka, I thought to myself how sad her expression looked.</p>
<p class="null-p">And somehow I wanted to do something to change that. I wanted‐‐to make her smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, I never thought I had some special power.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could even imagine <Ratatoskr>and Mio's calculations at the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">For me‐‐the order has been reversed from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't save them because I had the power. I saved them because I had the chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why‐‐the situation hasn't changed at all for me since then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. That Spirit‐‐<Beast>, had the exact same sad expression, just like what Tohka had at the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when he confronted <Beast>, there was something that he wanted to do even before all that fear. He wanted to see her smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly, it was just for that reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that motivation was enough for Shidou to risk his life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"………………………………………………………………………, Haah."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a long, long, silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori finally sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……You idiot. Really……you idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then she squeezed out those words as if whispering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐<Yggdrafolium>no. 1 through no.10, drive in parallel formation to form a defensive territory."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Shidou looked dumbfounded at what Kotori was saying. However, Kotori didn't respond to this as smoothly spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Fraxinus EX>, unfold invisible camouflage and wait 500 meters above the sky. Battle deployment through Kannazuki's manual operation. Approve CRUnits for Tobiichi Origami and Ellen Mathers. Wait near the site‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"K-Kotori‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou asked while his expression was being marked by confusion, Kotori shrugged with a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the minimal requirement. ‐‐What, do you expect me to let you stand naked before a Spirit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐! That means……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's eyes widened as Kotori could only helplessly nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. Really‐‐you won't listen to anything anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou's expression immediately brightened as he grabbed Kotori's hands. Kotori's face cheeks slightly flushed as she huffed from her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah, really, I'm totally uncomfortable with myself. I wonder why this is happening. ……Even though I know I'm going to regret this. I can't help but be persuaded by Shidou."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she casted her gaze as she mumbled out a few complaints. Seeing this, Shidou slightly shrugged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm relieved. If Kotori couldn't be convinced, it would be even more of a dream to make that Spirit fall in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't be so complacent."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori dropped her hand over Shidou's head to force him to regain focus.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Anyway, since it's decided, let's go back to the briefing room. I think everyone else must be worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou voice grew more excited as he extended his hand to Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">But then, Kotori suddenly let out an "ah" sound as if recalling something, and then pulled back from Shidou's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you wait a little? ‐‐There's something I need to prepare."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Prepare?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori sighed self-deprecatingly as she unraveled her black ribbon tying her left twintails‐‐to think that she was persuade by Shidou and gave him permission.</p>
<p class="null-p">No. Saying it like that was also incorrect.</p>
<p class="null-p">There really was no other alternative. Now on this earth, there was no other fighting force that could combat that Spirit. What Shidou said wasn't wrong, even if he was trying to appeal emotionally.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was better to say that Kotori was the one thinking emotionally. Because she was too worried about Shidou's safety, she couldn't make a calm judgement.</p>
<p class="null-p">After being reminded by Shidou‐‐she was finally able to make the decision. Really, it felt awkward that the commander needed to hear this.</p>
<p class="null-p">(‐‐I don't have the protection of <Camael>right now. But if I were a man who ran away from a Spirit for this reason‐‐would you still love me Kotori?) The words that Shidou had said lingered in her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori immediately responded to this and she still felt her answer was correct. ‐‐In the first place, Shidou's evaluation of himself was too low. Even without displaying bravery, there were still many admirable traits he had.</p>
<p class="null-p">But. If she were asked if she would hate Shidou for standing up even with no chances of victory, Kotori would shake her head and say no.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even without doing this, Kotori would still love Shidou‐‐but it was because Shidou was like this that she loved him so much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………To fall in love with a weakness. How stupid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori, smiling while diverting the conversation, put the black ribbon that she just removed into her pocket and in exchange took out a white ribbon.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐The proof of the weak side of Kotori. The symbol for Kotori as Shidou's little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was both a source of pride and curse for Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, the current Kotori certainly experienced the feeling of lovelorn. Suddenly confessing to someone whom your heart always loves, but then that person said that his feelings for her are not love. It was like a heartbreaking tragedy just like a drama.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"…...Emotions for little sister are inferior to love, whoever decided that‐‐‐‐hah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori whispered softly, using the white ribbon in her hand and tying it to the left side of her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Complete twintails hairstyle with black on the right and white on the left.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strong self and weak self. Confronted by the feeling that the two halves had broken the inviolable boundary to face each other, Kotori involuntarily smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori? That's‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">When seeing Kotori wearing two different ribbon colors, Shidou made a puzzled face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori closed her eyes, taking out a Chupa Chups from her pocket and putting it in her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, don't you know? I can be unexpectedly‐‐‐very greedy."</p>
<p class="null-p">And while licking her lips, she smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, as expected, just as Shidou had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Emotions for little sister are inferior to love; no one in this world rules it. The little sister couldn't win against a lover, no one in this world could decide. Even if someone defined it like that, Kotori didn't need to obey.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, it felt like she was falling into a tiny frame.‐‐‐By herself, being a younger sister would be fine. Just be a little sister, and love Shidou is fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, just that is not enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, Kotori still can't give up on either side.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, Kotori tied her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Black and white.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Commander who loved Shidou, and a little sister who was loved more than lovers, will fight together from now on.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, being once rejected is nothing. Kotori is Shidou's little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just being pampered as a sister, just be loved as a girl. Different from his true sister Mana‐‐the one who is capable of such that thing, wasn't it only Kotori in this world?</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/date-a-live/illustrations/date-a-live_vol_21_15.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Well, shall we go. Onii-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh‐‐‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori smiled mischievously, taking Shidou's hand and then leaving the office.</p>
<p class="null-p">She absolutely won't let Shidou die. She kept that strong determination in her heart.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Shidou-san, Kotori-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mun. We've been waiting, you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look‐‐it's just like I said! They've reconciled! ‐‐Alright, if memory serves the wager was to be able to hug and sniff Natsumi-san ten times?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no such thing. I've didn't bet on anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou and Kotori returned back to the briefing room, the girls there shouted either feeling happy or relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I made you worry, everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why were you waiting even though I said to take a rest?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori smiled while shrugging her shoulders. She had brilliantly returned back to being the reliable commander.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Thank you. Sorry for worrying everyone. But I'm okay now. I'm finally prepared."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori spoke, sitting back in her chair and looking around at the crowd.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐The ship has now entered combat operations. The target is the Spirit dormant on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">Codenamed <Beast>. As of 21 o'clock today, the being the contact of Itsuka Shidou and the target‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, while saying that Kotori sharpened her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Date and make her fall in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone started getting excited upon hearing Kotori's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku, it really is necessary!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agreement. This is <Ratatoskr>."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uh, but is this really okay? Won't Boy not be regenerating now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nia said that while scratching her cheek. Shidou nodded with a slight degree of tension.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Aah. I'll still try to solve this. Although indeed she is a dangerous</p>
<p class="null-p">Spirit‐‐I don't think that it is completely impossible to communicate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm……well, so it'll be that specialized method. Well, if Boy who is the expert in Spirit capture says so, I won't say anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, thank you, Nia."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Shidou said that, Nia gently waved her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori continued on while adding to his.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, we are also making the corresponding countermeasures. Shidou will be protected by the voluntary territory and <Fraxinus>will be on standby. ‐‐Origami, I want you be deployed as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Kotori's command, Origami briefly nodded. Her simplicity felt inexplicably reliable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kotori looked around the room again, lowering her eyes, taking a deep breath, and then opening them again. "Alright, let's begin our war (date)‐‐" ‐‐However.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words weren't able to be finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">Halfway through speaking, Kotori opened her eyes wide, staring at the center of the room with an incredulous look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kotori……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wondering what happened, Shidou also turned his eyes to follow Kotori's gaze. Everyone else followed suit as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Shidou and the others finally noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the center of the oval table, exactly at the place where the image was being displayed‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐A blade like a key was extending out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha……this is‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou couldn't help but stare breathlessly. Then, Mukuro, who was sitting at the table, seemed to notice something as her shoulders trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible, this can't be……<Michael>!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, from the open void, only the shape of a blade was extending out.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was exactly the same as <Michael>, the key Angel that Mukuro had once wielded.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐The blade rotated slowly as if to respond to Mukuro's cry of astonishment. It was as if twisting a key into a keyhole.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very next moment, with the blade as the starting point, a huge hole opened in space‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, that figure appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hair that had lost its pigmentation, cracked scars decorating the Astral Dress, and a claw just like a beast.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also‐‐ten swords surrounding her like a prison cell.</p>
<p class="null-p">The mysterious Spirit <Beast>had arrived here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be. How could this……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"<Be‐‐ast>……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls' panic filled the briefing room. It seemed this abnormality was noticed a beat too late as an alarm suddenly resounded on the ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the midst of the noise, the girl crawled out from the hole and blankly stared while moving through the air‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐A, aa‐‐aaaaaaaaaaaaaa‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">A hoarse war-like roar resounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing this roar, the Spirits were all frightened, trembling, or struggling to breathe.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was a natural response. The overwhelming sense of intimidation that this girl exuded felt like a dangerous atmosphere where all onlookers would be pierced by a sharpened blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐But, in the midst of all the shudders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only Shidou, despite his forehead heavily sweating, stood in front of the girl and directly looked at her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……You've unexpectedly come to see me at your own initiative. ‐‐I feel honored."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while still feeling that intense Reiryoku shaking his entire body, he still smiled fearlessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was already prepared.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had already made his decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">So then there was no need to be afraid.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no time to tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Shidou must save this girl from now on‐‐!</p>
<p class="null-p">Shidou took one step forward while saying the words he had inherited from Kotori.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Now, let's begin our war (date)."</p>
<p class="null-p">To be continued</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">The last volume's afterword said this one will be the last one. That was a lie. Long time no see, I am Tachibana Kōshi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Date A Live 21 Tohka Good End First Half has been delivered. What do you think? It would be great if you enjoyed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I had no intention of lying to everyone. I had intended this volume to be the last one.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when thinking of what to write for a conclusion of the main story, I suddenly wanted an epilogue for all of the Spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this manner, everyone will have a chapter. There are ten chapters excluding the prologue, but as expected it was too thick to fit into one book, so it ended up becoming a separate volume.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, it is possible to force a 600 page volume. However, the editor said, "You can double the frontispiece and illustrations if you split it in half". When I noticed this, I said, "Okay, then please." There's no better policy than the number of illustrations.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the number of characters increase, some characters will appear in illustrations less. But with two volumes, everyone can appear on the illustrations. This really is wonderful. It may have been better to have divided it all into ten volumes while saying there are two parts each. A gorgeous colored frontispiece and illustrations for every 60 pages……would that just be a picture book?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So the final chapter of Date A Live. Although it is the author's personal sentiment, the cover is quite suitable for the grand finale, echoing a sense of reunion. It must be a good end. The editor-in chief who saw it for the first time even said, "Are you sure? Do you want to change the title?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, leaving that aside, this cover is my favorite in the Date A Live series so far. There's a special feeling in the cover and the character design is amazing as well. Although personal preference is included, I am amazed by Tsunakosan always bringing out such amazing products all the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Hmm? I'm not giving high praise with blurry eyes. Absolutely not. Completely that's not it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, I think many people already know about this, but there is one announcement.</p>
<p class="null-p">New Date A Live series animation and Date A Bullet anime are currently underway! A round of applause!</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't wait to see the world created by Higashide-san and NOCO-san being animated. Follow up information will gradually be announced, so please stay tuned!</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, this book was published thanks to the efforts of these various people.</p>
<p class="null-p">Illustrator Tsunako-san, thank you for your wonderful illustrations as usual. Aren't they just too cute? Forgive me for saying, "I want Nagisa-san's illustrations" at the very last minute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Editor-san, sorry always for the inconvenience. I will try and keep volume 22 on schedule as much as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Designer Kusano-san, thank you again for those stylish designs. I humbly ask you to give much advice for the new anime.</p>
<p class="null-p">I would also like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in editing, publishing, distributing, selling, etc. and above all else, you who are holding this book now.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is why the story continues with the next volume Date A Live Volume 22 Second Half.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hope you will keep up with the curtain call of Date A Live until the very end.</p>
<p class="null-p">September 2019 Tachibana Kōshi.</p>
