<p class="null-h1">"Violet Evergarden"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ingredients that composed me were:</p>
<p class="null-p">a teaspoon of selfishness, tears and white camellias;s a tablespoon of loneliness, irritation and Alberta; a pinch of sadness from being treated as a tool;</p>
<p class="null-p">and a dash of apprehension and hope towards the future</p>
<p class="null-p">as a finishing touch.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was made of such things.</p>
<p class="null-p">A teaspoon of artificiality, detachment and indifference;</p>
<p class="null-p">a tablespoon of an emerald brooch, innocence and</p>
<p class="null-p">devotion; a pinch of secrets from the past hidden within blue irises;</p>
<p class="null-p">and a dash of a spirit bearing no fear towards a search</p>
<p class="null-p">for the unknown, along with an ability to take action, as a finishing touch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet Evergarden was made of such things.</p>
<p class="null-p">After falling in, coming to know about and receiving love, I changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">While staring outside in the depths of a forest, I suddenly found myself pondering over how much that eccentric AutoMemories Doll might have changed by now.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 01: The Princess and the Auto Memory Doll</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a traditional event, so to speak."</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta told the woman following her from behind as they stepped onto the carpet laid throughout the corridors, on which were drawn white camellias as the motif of her nation.</p>
<p class="null-p">She occupied the number one seat of royal court lady in the Drossel Kingdom as its governess. Such was her role and profession.</p>
<p class="null-p">A moderately frilly white apron was tied over her long black dress, which was perfectly buttoned-up to some extent. The distinctly dressed figure of Alberta, an elderly woman with white strands mixed in her hair, left a different impression on viewers in comparison to the other younger court ladies.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that the people who passed by her, enveloped as she was in a deep solemnity, maintained politeness and nodded on sight made known that her status in the palace was quite high.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our country of Drossel has since the old days been solving political issues and avoiding war through heightening marriage with the royal families of neighboring nations. Not a single princess born here has stayed in the country. They all marry into foreign ones. However, there exists a national sentiment of those who do not think well of this, and the event has its formalities, so there was a need to show that the princesses marrying out of the nest of their nation have been doing so in the name of full-fledged love for the foreign princes."</p>
<p class="null-p">While speaking, Alberta had noticed that the one she was talking to walked in a disturbingly silent way. Regardless of how smooth the carpet they were stepping onto could be, she was unable even to feel the other's presence from her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was similar to the pacing of covert-action knights, which she had only had a few opportunities to witness during her long time working in the court. Unlike ordinary knights, covert-action ones had their existence itself undisclosed and belonged to a secret organization of the king's personal use. In order to exterminate people and eavesdrop on conversations, they did not make sounds when walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Becoming slightly nervous and turning around, she found a woman not lesser than the gorgeous interior of the palace behind her properly standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would be the Public Love Letters, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The words spewing from her rosy lips sounded as beautiful as the singing of birds.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Alberta was someone of the same gender as her, she was dumbfounded for an instant at such beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her golden hair gleamed as it bathed in the sunlight pouring in brightly from the palace's windows. Framed by lashes of the same shade of gold, her eyes were blue gems. What encased her body was a Prussian-blue jacket over a snow-white ribbon-tie dress. Precisely on the middle of the ribbon-tie was a conspicuously outstanding emerald brooch.</p>
<p class="null-p">Black gloves covered the hands that held onto her trolley bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lastly, her feet were decorated with cocoa-brown knit-up boots. Said boots stepped steadily onto the carpet, so walking without producing any noise was probably the woman's technique.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, correct. This is why you were called, Lady Violet</p>
<p class="null-p">Evergarden."</p>
<p class="null-p">Pronounced by Alberta's hoarse voice, even her name was elegant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Albeit feeling some sort of extraordinary aura from the Auto-Memories Doll, who was well-featured to an uncommon extent, Alberta pulled herself together and guided the latter to her client ‐ the third princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Drossel Kingdom was a small nation, with its palace located by the riverside. Overflowing with artistic beauty, its constructions were famous, making tourism industry the main source of income for the people. As manmade flowerbeds were widespread in the capital, it was nicknamed the "City of Flowers".</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the palace and royal family existed, the political affairs had been transferred to the parliament and the royal family was to the citizens a symbol of history. Should someone born into the royal household be a man, his job would be to take part in events from all sorts of countries, but the present condition of the women, as the court lady Alberta had explained, was of political assets coerced to marry into other nations.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Violet Evergarden from the CH Postal Service is here to have an audience with Your Highness, the third princess Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel."</p>
<p class="null-p">And such was the current situation of the country's only princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have arrived, amanuensis."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the far back of the audience room, the third princess of Drossel lay carelessly on the reverently arranged royal seat, embracing stuffed toys.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lighter than brown, her pinkish, amber rose-colored hair cascaded like the flow of a river. Her tiara, which had probably been on her head, was thrown on the floor along with used paper tissues, and the person who had done so bore the face of someone that had wept her soul out. Had her nose not been abrade and her eyes not red and bloodshot, it could be noted that she was an adorable girl in her teens.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was clad in a magnificent royal blue dress, at the moment, she looked like nothing but a grumblingly sniffling child.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta covered her face with one hand and let out a prolonged sigh at the princess's figure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pleased to make your acquaintance. I rush anywhere my clients might desire. I am from the Auto-Memories Dolls service, Violet Evergarden."</p>
<p class="null-p">Meanwhile, as the invited woman, Violet, stood up from her kneeling position, she expressed gracious etiquette without undoing her doll-like deadpan. She could not make sense of the country's only princess very well, but also did not illustrate an aspect of nervousness as the latter displayed her loss of temper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel. As this country's third princess, from this point on, I am set to marry the prince of a neighboring nation, Damian Baldur Flügel. I will have you ghostwrite the public love letters that I am supposed to exchange with Lord Damian."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice still sounded young.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Princess, even if you speak with such high-leveled dignity, your appearance is unbecoming."</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta offered a candid comment, at which Charlotte puffed her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Women about to get married are emotionally unstable.</p>
<p class="null-p">You would know this since you got married two times, right, Alberta? Two times! Must be nice! People from the lower classes are able to get divorced!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave me out of it... Princess, even though this person is hired, she is from a different country. You are not setting an example. Please sit back properly on your throne. You girls, too, do not mind the princess and go fix her hair."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Alberta clapped her hands snappily, the other court ladies, who had been in-waiting, revealed themselves and put both the floor and the princess in order. In a matter of few minutes, on the account of rice powder, blush and the right sitting posture, Charlotte was reconstructed into a presentable figure. Upright, she was a figure worthy of praising as a lovely and fine-looking princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if her poise had been there from the very beginning, Charlotte sharply pointed the gemstone-laden rod within her grip at Violet,</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Public Love Letters are a traditional practice in this entire region. Whether the beautiful texts will indeed communicate love and whether they will indeed cause people</p>
<p class="null-p">to believe that the marriage between the two of us is something superb ‐ all of it depends on your skills." "I am aware. I shall work not to betray the expectations."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow, it doesn't feel like I'm talking to a human being. You're like a person's shadow... sometimes, amanuensis. How old are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the question, Violet's expression changed into one of surprise for the first time ever since she had arrived at the place. She briefly put on a thoughtful facial expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, are you going to lie about your age? Please hurry and answer."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I apologize. The truth is I do not know how old I am." Charlotte blinked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You lie. There's no one who wouldn't know their own age."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am an orphan."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the answer, the room that had already been quiet was enveloped even further in the sounds of complete silence for an instant. Charlotte realized that there were people who were exceptions to what she deemed as logical common sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">The princess could have pretended that she had committed</p>
<p class="null-p">no blunder right then, but after the bewilderment, she closed her eyes as if in shame.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was wrong of me. I did know the reality that there are people in these kinds of unfortunate circumstances amongst the lower classes. There's no way of telling what they're like until meeting them personally, huh? Could you forgive my rudeness?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do not mind it. Such words are a waste. I have never felt that it was unfortunate. But back to the topic, why inquire my age?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Slightly underwhelmed by the not at all sorrowful reply, Charlotte responded:</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're a commoner, so I wanted to know how you feel about something, since you have the looks of someone still young... Up until what age do you think one would have a chance with an older man?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By 'chance', you mean...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Until what point it is possible to see him as an object of romantic interest."</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta whispered into her ear complementarily.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that, Violet made the same thoughtful face of before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What... might 'romantic interest' be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now everyone in the room had question marks over their heads.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, I'm the one asking the questions, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I... do not understand... the feeling of romantic love."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet took her emerald-green brooch into her hand and caressed its gleaming surface, "I apologize. I am in the middle of studying this subject. But if I were to try answering in the way I can... There are countless married couples and lovers with age gaps. Aren't there no particular societal borders for age?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if the other is ten years older?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I believe that is unrelated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if there's no love?" Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am reflecting... about the love part."</p>
<p class="null-p">That single word had most likely knocked Violet down even deeper within a swirl of thoughts. She wound up falling silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with you!? How have you lived your life until now!? The conversation isn't carrying on properly! Rather than about myself, I'm worried for your future! You're going to write love letters in this condition?! I called you over because I heard that your ghostwriting is highly rumored.</p>
<p class="null-p">Make sure not to disappoint me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Charlotte's legs and arms squirmed in indignation,</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet said concisely,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Certainly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say that with a little more expression on your face! It kinda feels like I'm the only one who's angry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I am not angry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't like being the only one exposing my feelings! Cease this inexpressiveness!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told so, Violet brought her hands close to her cheeks, pushing them lightly. As though concluding that something was not right, she halted midway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will attempt to make an effort, so could I have you wait a moment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She then started touching her soft cheeks again. Apparently, she was attempting to do something about her lack of expression with physical strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to withstand it, Charlotte stepped down from her throne and clung onto Alberta.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alberta! This amanuensis is a deception!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta retorted as if to admonish Charlotte, who had set her feet onto the wooden floor,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Violet is someone greatly promising in the world of Auto-Memories Dolls. Humans are creatures that show sides different from their private lives when working."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someone who doesn't understand romantic love can't possibly write a delightful love letter!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte's desperate shout echoed throughout the palace, yet her lamentation was annulled a few days thereafter.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, if I said that merely uttering your name or writing it like this causes my heart to quiver, what would you think? My days in this capital of flowers consist of sighing at uniting with you through several sorts of circumstances. When I observe the Moon in the night sky, for instance, I think of the eclipsed Moon as a petal dancing down flutteringly. And, in sequence, I ponder about the following ‐ what do you think of when you see the same thing? Might it be the claw of a cat, or perhaps a shining curved sword? As one would expect, do you see the Moon as simply a moon? I am certain that I will deem whatever you answer as wonderful and likely break into a smile. Out of the pitch-dark nights in which the stars reflect beautifully on the sky, is there any in which you think of me in your moonlit palace? No, I do not mind if it is not under the Moon. Even should it be under the skies of gleaming dew at dawn, by a riverside of perfectly clear blue that steals hearts away, or within a mob where not even standing still is permitted, is there any situation in which you think of me as I think of you? Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, at what times do I cross your mind? While lovingly admiring white camellias, I am always thinking of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of the palace, where the citizens gathered in a commotion, a well-dressed young court lady read the princess's love letter aloud from a scroll made of parchment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having listened to it all, the audience had their hearts pierced through by the princess's innocent maiden-in-love traits and raised their voices in cheers for the love letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte is adorable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right!! And she is very relatable! I often wonder about what the person I like thinks of me in the dead of the night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We absolutely cannot miss how Lord Damian will reply to this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Primarily, the first phase of the Public Love Letters consisted of a voiced announcement done by someone from the court, and the second phase consisted of affixing the letter to the city's bulletin board. Next, the other party's love letter would be delivered and the people would watch over the exchange of the love letters together.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Auto-Memories Doll is a specialist in heartrending texts this time round, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With this, we gotta see what kind of Auto-Memories Doll was hired by Flügel, yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In actuality, the population had no idea that the exchange was merely a courteous one. To them, the Public Love Letters had already turned into a festival that occurred once every few decades.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you don't understand romantic love, aren't you pretty good with love letters?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A while after the public presentation, in a garden within the palace's premises, Charlotte and Violet sat face-to-face at a table and had tea inside of a dome-shaped resting spot, on which were carved sculptures of goddesses and angels.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the garden of rather clear skies and dazzling sunlight, flowerbeds of white camellias swayed and blew off along the breeze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I myself do not have a grasp of romantic love, yet ever since being employed in this profession, I have read many books as a matter of course. Romance novels included. Once you retain as information the vocabulary, writing style and clichés that they comprise, all left to do is piece them together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that? You talk almost like it's math. Well, that's fine as long as it had a good reception from the citizens.</p>
<p class="null-p">But you made a lot of things up, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In every corner of the world, the so-called 'maidens in love' ponder about their significant other all day long and keep wishing to know the latter's feelings. In romance novels, statistically speaking, that is."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Violet gracefully drank her black tea, Charlotte snorted. She wanted to make the expression of that woman who was practically perfectly doll-like collapse somehow, but could not find a deft way to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't forgive it if the reply loses to this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it a matter of winning or losing?"</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The love letter from Flügel was sent to Drossel soon afterward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, this is for you, who bears praiseworthy beauty in your castle of white camellias. On the subject of what I think about under the moonlight, it is not an easy question to answer. I imagine all sorts of things concerning our future. What kind of sound would my heart make once we see each other face-to-face? When the time we exchange a kiss eventually comes, will you be bashfully smiling as you open your eyes? Once I embrace your thin body, will I be able to keep my touch as gentle as if you were made of glass? My racing feelings in regards of you, the object of my passion in my love story, overflow constantly. From this point on, you will be the person I shall pay most attention to in my life. My eyes already belong to you, and your existence has enraptured my thoughts as well. Despite being a princess, you are almost as a water spirit that sinks ships with your silky singing voice. It is extremely difficult to convey to you that I am drowning in love. The only thing I can say straight away is that I believe I want to touch you, once you become mine, soon enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the love letter from Flügel, which a messenger had read with a resonant voice, the faces of young Drossel women grew pink, and there were those who fainted on the spot. Meanwhile, upon listening to said love letter, the face of its recipient, Charlotte, became beet-red, then her body shuddered, and finally, she locked herself in her bedroom while shedding tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet and Alberta, who had been reading along, eyed the enemy together in front of the room's closed doors.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Might she be embarrassed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That manner of crying is not so. It is the crying face of when things do not go as the princess envisioned."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You understand her quite well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have known the princess since before she was born. When she came into this world, she was set apart from the hands of her mother, the queen, and I watched over her growth... Since our statuses differ, this cannot be revealed to the people of this country, but she is as my own daughter. I know her crying faces."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the crying face of just now was of disgust towards the fervent response?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta fell silent for a moment at Violet's question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The princess has met her marriage partner, Lord Damian, only one time. It seems the two of them had a conversation other than during their greetings. That was still before the engagement was discussed. Back then, the princess had been crying. In the end, she never said why. For all I know, she might be thinking about whatever that is..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta wound up laughing a little at the Auto-Memories Doll who spoke in-between the breaks in conversation impudent and skillfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person is still a child. However, she has a prominent adult-like side. We have raised her this way, in an ambiguous condition. Perhaps because her childhood was cut short, the princess goes back to being an infant every now and then. She wails and loses her composure. Lady Violet, the princess might be inadequate as the face of her people, but please do forgive her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am the Doll of my clients. Such consideration is not necessary. Speaking of which, I have not yet seen the king and queen; is it needless for me to greet them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the question, Alberta shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The king has governmental affairs to take care of. The queen has... been living in the Imperial Palace for several years now. They will most likely attend the wedding's arbitration ceremony, however... Excuse me; I will check the princess's situation for a moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet bowed once and left the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta took a ring with several keys out of her apron's pocket and inserted the most neatly polished one of them into the door's keyhole.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Princess, even if you hide, I will know where you are right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the princess's bedroom were numerous pieces of furniture unified by the color white and brimming with a sense of high quality. Heading past a dresser and enormous bed that seemed like places a person would hide in, Alberta made her way to beside the curtains, which clearly bulged in a human shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she turned one of the layers over, there Charlotte was, hiccupping and sobbing within the lace screens.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do not understand this mentality of hiding even though you want to be found..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alberta, you meanie! You mother-in-law!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I were your actual mother-in-law, you would have lost points with me by now. Princess, when you become emotional, you quickly forget about your position... I am worried. In Flügel... I will not be with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">At those words, Charlotte's tears stopped completely and she was momentarily petrified just like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She continued staring at Alberta wordlessly, and then, tears slowly started coming out of her eyes again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How can you say such a thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was aware of the fact, yet had not wanted to hear it from the person in question. Such feelings seeped out from her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am the imperial governess of the Royal Palace. I believe that a number of young court ladies will follow you as you leave the country, but I cannot join them. My role is of raising the princesses born in this country."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could just raise my children. Say, when I have them, I'll call you over. Alberta, you'll want to see my children too, won't you? Living in Flügel will surely be fun if we're together. Isn't that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Charlotte stared at her with imploring eyes, Alberta turned her head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is not a proposal I can straightforwardly nod to. I belong to the Royal Palace, not you, Lady Charlotte."</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte's lips trembled erratically. She swung her small fists and hit Alberta's chest without any force.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You... pulled me out of my mother's womb, and you...</p>
<p class="null-p">raised me! I have forgotten what my mother's face looks like! You belong to me...! At the very least, I belong to you! You've raised me from the beginning of my life until this point! That's a part of your own life! Even so... Even so... how can you cut me away... so easily...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Princess, it is for your sake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's for my sake, you're supposed to stay beside me... Enough already... It feels like those letters, you and a lot of other things will split my head open..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Princess..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go away... Just go away!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wrapping herself around the curtains, Charlotte crouched on the spot and concealed her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I will be by your side."</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta did not leave even after being told to do so. She retracted the hand that was about to touch Charlotte and instead mutely embraced her from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such gentleness made her happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such gentleness was hateful.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such gentleness was something she feared losing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fury, sorrow and joy welled within Charlotte, making her disoriented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"... If you won't be with me, don't treat me kindly."</p>
<p class="null-p">She did her best to say so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is precisely because I cannot go with you... that I want to treat you kindly. Even if only for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless, Alberta's reply caused her to cry once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sounds of her sobs ensued continuously for a while, and, after a moment of silence, Charlotte asked with a shaky voice,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey... When I get married, what will happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an extremely abstract question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By 'what', you mean...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Alberta inquired back more remarkably softly than usual, Charlotte asked like a small child,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't be able to come back here anymore, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are the princess, after all. You cannot carefreely return."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, who should I lean onto over there? What if I ever need someone's help?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will dedicate myself to Flügel. To Lord Damian as well. That's what I was born for. I've lived as a princess because it's my social status. This is what I can do for my people. But..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte added in a rapid succession before Alberta could say anything,</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, even though I'm a princess, I'm a crybaby."</p>
<p class="null-p">Conspicuously large teardrops traveled from Charlotte's eyes down her white cheeks,</p>
<p class="null-p">"A crybaby and a scaredy-cat."</p>
<p class="null-p">She touched the hands of Alberta, who remained embracing her from behind, as if clinging onto the latter,</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are lots of things I can't do."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a huge mission for a small body. Its inside was filled to the brim with anxiety.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Up until now, you have been with me. It's because you were here that I was able to do my best at many things. You... All that's left for you to do is see me off. But after being sent away, what will happen to me...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she turned her neck to look at the face Charlotte was making, Alberta swallowed a breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte was completely pale and terrified, her tears pouring like rain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm... in a situation that I won't be allowed to run away from."</p>
<p class="null-p">Reflected in Charlotte's orbs, Alberta had an expression of being at loss.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what she said, it was but her selfishness, and she could not replace her. However, the fact that the girl was currently truly suffering was conveyed to her. Her suffering became Alberta's own.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian will surely become your strength."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though... our marriage is arranged?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will he be able to cherish a woman he doesn't even like?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"With time, you will build a good relationship."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alberta, I plan to do make an effort. Of course, this is my intention. I'll give my very best... but, what about Lord Damian?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alberta was unable to answer.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">With the one on the giving and one on the receiving end not knowing each other's actual feelings, the Public Love Letters continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, did you know that there is an anecdote in my country that states presenting a gold ribbon to a loved one will make said love bear fruit? Gold is the color of the stars. Be it during day or night, they twinkle right above us in spite of visibility. No matter how far apart we are in physical distance, we are under the same light. The gold ribbon fulfills the role of emissary from the stars and communicates these feelings even when we are unable to be with each other. Please think of it as me and have it by your side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, I have certainly received the gold ribbon. Right now, the golden color of the stars is emitting a soft luster on my arm. Since you have told me about Drossel's love anecdote, let me tell you about how there is a charm credibly spoken of amongst couples over here in Flügel as well. I have sent to you a handkerchief embroidered with Flügel roses, which the knights of Flügel leave to the lovers that remain in the country when they head to the battlefields. Flügel roses bloom with a red as passionate as the feelings of couples and are roses that have been improved by our country. There is a reason why we chose them. Their flower language stands for "you are mine for eternity". When I reflect about the future, in which your beauty will elate its greatest, I even wind up thinking that I wish to take you in my hands soon and lock you up somewhere without ever letting anyone look at you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, the other day, perhaps because I had been staring at a portrait of you all day long, just from the wind swaying a door, I ended up wondering if you were there. Strange, is it not? There is a large river between our countries, and you are beyond it, in the kingdom within a forest of abundant green. There is absolutely no way you could have come here. Regardless, I find myself thinking so. From now on, too, I will surely recall you in several instances. Will the pain and trembling that spread in my chest during these occasions disappear once I go to where you are?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, your pain is my pain. The sound your heart makes must be definitely similar to mine. We both count the days we will see each other on our fingers. This truth alone is what comforts me about your absence. In my palace, the preparations for me to welcome you are proceeding steadily. This buzzing in my heart during this time in which I cannot see you is a trial to how long it will take until the day I will be able to hold you, is it not? You might believe that you will be coming to an unknown country completely by yourself. However, the one waiting for you is your servant in love and the one who will protect you. If you leave everything to me, I am positive that anything will go well."</p>
<p class="null-p">As per the pattern of the Public Love Letters, in order to give further depth to the exchange, the arrangements for the wedding ceremony were progressing as well.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's stay would last one month. In that meantime, the imperial court of Drossel gradually became frantic. The country's only princess would depart to a foreign nation, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was no exaggeration to say that the list of items to assemble for the wedding went from a corner to the other of the long corridors. The difference between the princess and civilians was that the ones taking care of her necessities were people other than herself. Despite being the person at the center of such whirlpool, Charlotte was disconnected from the tumult.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to contemplate the contents of her letters, she was once again having a meeting with Violet over tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet, pass the milk."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"These sweets are delicious. Do eat more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">They had naturally become used to each other's way of keeping a distance from one another due to being face-toface. Away from the royal court ladies, they tasted black tea by themselves in the garden's dome.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a very quiet tea party, in which the light breeze caressed the hair of the two maidens and retreated. Perhaps because she was under the influence of the ever-so-silent Violet, or because of the pre-marriage emotional instability, Charlotte's conduct and tone were passive as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How should I respond... to the next letter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Charlotte muttered in pauses, Violet replied with a calm voice,</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you obediently agree to the words of the other side, the romantic tactics will come to a closing, so I believe we should stretch them for a little longer." "Somehow, I don't care..."</p>
<p class="null-p">A deep sigh ensued.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Charlotte's heart had been restless during the first stage of the letters' exchange, as of now, she had become as serene as a still ocean.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face was weary as mirrored on the black tea. She did not spare even a glance at the vast assortment of sweets arranged on the table, her hand fiddling with her fine strands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I bet an amanuensis like you was hired to ghostwrite for him anyway. They might not even debate over the contents as we do, in a way... Unlike a third princess, the youngest child, Prince Damian of Flügel is someone waiting for his right as the next to succeed the throne. This is surely the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Princess, it seems you are unsatisfied with the other side's replies..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet put sugar into her tea and mixed it with a silver spoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because of the silence, the sound of it rang loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Clatter-clatter, clatter-clatter. It was a disturbed noise, much like the one from within Charlotte's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">The marriage was a political one. A sweet taste of happiness was not all there was to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's not like that... I think the contents are passionate and they make my heart palpitate. Right now, amongst the</p>
<p class="null-p">young women of this country, it seems that Lord Damian's rank is in a state of rise. It's just that..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte raised her cast-down face, the flowerbeds of the garden reflecting in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The heaps of white camellias held their necks high. That year, too, the most prosperous season of those white camellias planted throughout the country had paid off. From such a sight, Charlotte was able to see the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just that... the Lord Damian that I only met once was not the sort of person to use such words."</p>
<p class="null-p">Within her orbs, a scenery from her memories faintly resurfaced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet had not particularly incited a conversation. She was wordlessly drinking her black tea. If the other party facing Charlotte were the court ladies that loved to chitchat or Alberta, who could be considered her foster parent, she would probably not have felt like continuing with the following words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That person... is completely different from those letters."</p>
<p class="null-p">Not saying anything, Violet earnestly directed only her blue eyes at Charlotte. Noticing her gaze, Charlotte touched the tiara on her own head. The symbol of the royal family shone silver. It would get on her way when she was crying, so she would always toss it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte delicately unraveled it from her hair and left it on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just for now, I want to quit being the third princess of Drossel."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hers was not the tone of someone telling a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet, just for now, quit being an amanuensis and listen to my story as your original self. Simply listening to it is fine. I don't need advice or pity. Just... listening to it is fine. Listening alone is fine," she said repeatedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet settled her teacup onto its saucer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">And, as expected, she nodded just like a doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such attitude and aloof voice, which had primarily irritated Charlotte, granted her nothing but a feeling of ease now.</p>
<p class="null-p">This Doll definitely doesn't turn her back to her superior's orders.</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte smiled a little. It was the first time that the princess flung a smile at the Doll. She had always showed nothing but herself crying and lamenting over her fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">No longer a princess, Charlotte began narrating to Violet,</p>
<p class="null-p">"On my tenth birthday, a grandiose banquet was held in the castle of Drossel."</p>
<p class="null-p">The day had also been the one in which Charlotte had joined society. Since she had been raised inside the palace as if being hid until that point, it had been a complete change of environment.</p>
<p class="null-p">There had been famous princes and envoys from neighboring countries, as well as face-to-face meetings with a number of marriage candidates large enough for her not to remember them all. Dances and conversations she was unused to had extended late into the night. Absolutely exhausted by them, she had fled to the garden without taking along a court lady to accompany her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Age-wise, ten-year-olds are considered children, but amongst royalty, it's safe to say that we have entered a marriageable age by then. I didn't have the slightest impression that my birthday was being celebrated."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever anyone would open their mouth, it was about matrimony. The quick-witted ones had even started thinking up names for her children. Even though her partner had not been decided, the fact that Charlotte would get married already had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was annoyed. Why did I have no choice but think about marriage? Why did everyone want to rush things up? Why did I have to be born a woman? Why are women the ones to give birth? Why did I have to be a princess? Why did nobody ask me what I wanted to do? I was thinking about these things a lot, and all those superficial words of congratulations wounded my heart... so... I naturally ended up crying."</p>
<p class="null-p">The main star of the banquet tearing up by herself was not something that anybody should have found out. It would paint the face of Drossel, the host, with mud. Despite being a small child, she was aware of that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her outfit on that day had been a pure white chiffon dress. Surely, if she mingled with the loads of white camellia flowerbeds, no one would find her. Thinking so, she had sneaked into a flowerbed slightly exposed by the moonlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was weeping nonstop in the middle of white camellias.</p>
<p class="null-p">Many things had made me depressed."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no going back anymore. She had become unable to return to the times when her birthday was merely something to be happy about ever again. She had already joined the adults. Had ceased being someone who belonged only to herself. She had already become a political tool of a princess in the true meaning of the term. She was simply Charlotte no more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about that, she had grown grief-stricken and tears had poured from her eyes incessantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That evening, the Crescent Moon was really beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">In a world of darkness, which the veil of the night had descended upon, what had consoled Charlotte was the not-soreliable moonlight alone. Had it been complete pitchdarkness, her fear would have added up to her sadness and she would probably have cried more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, y'know, the moonlight was suddenly blocked. I was startled when my field of vision blackened and raised my face. When I did so... that person was..."</p>
<p class="null-p">A man had been standing before her line of sight, which she had turned upwards without wiping her tears, concealing the Moon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...that person was staring at me as if looking at something extremely amusing."</p>
<p class="null-p">With an indescribable smile on, said man had spoken first, saying nothing but a single "yo". It was an improper word usage unthinkable to have come from someone who had entered that palace.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, squatting on the spot just as Charlotte had done, he had asked, "Has nobody come to find you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He had greeted me, so he knew I was Drossel's princess... but he treated me as if I were some child playing hide-andseek. That pissed me off... yet I had no idea how to reply, so I ended up crying more."</p>
<p class="null-p">As she did so, the man had stroked her head roughly and encouraged her fabrication of tears with a "cry on, cry on". The caressing had been similar to what one would do with a dog or cat. Not even Alberta had ever done something of the sort to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"While still sobbing, I asked of him, 'don't say that to me when what I want is to stop crying'. Still, no matter what, that person didn't tell me to stop crying. He gently patted me on the back and said, 'you can cry some more'. When I asked, 'how come?'..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Positioning himself in front of Charlotte, the man had cackled and said, "During the banquet, I thought you were a disturbing kid. Because you were behaving almost as if you were more adult-like than anyone else. I was relieved to see you crying outside. It's accurate. This birthday party is the worst. It'd make anyone want to bawl."</p>
<p class="null-p">"After hearing those words, I looked at his face seriously for the first time."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been certain that he was the prince of a prosperous country located in a basin deep within the woods. She had not been able to recall anything about him other than that. Not many recollections from when they greeted each other had remained in her, either. In such a garish world, everyone appeared to have the same features. However, unlike everybody else, who laughed as if wearing a mask, he had on a slightly ill-mannered smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">His short hair was the color of bronze. His face was freckled. His traits were by no means gallant. He was exceedingly normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, back then, I thought he was a wonderful person."</p>
<p class="null-p">There were other much more courteous princes. There were other far more fine-looking people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He didn't speak arrogantly to me or treat me like I was being too over-the-top for crying. I understood that he had left our statuses aside to talk to me when I saw his smiling face."</p>
<p class="null-p">The people in question had been a man in his mid-twenties and a ten-year-old girl. He had spoken to her because she had been wailing. Since she was a child, he had told her to cry as any child would. That was all the man had done. It had been his sole accomplishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">However...</p>
<p class="null-p">"It made..."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that alone...</p>
<p class="null-p">"It made..."</p>
<p class="null-p">That alone had been extremely...</p>
<p class="null-p">"It made me really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, that night, that instant, her heart had been stolen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte's eyes probably looked at no one, only seeing that person's shadow as it surfaced in them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Flushed cheeks, overlapping fingers, shaky lips. They all brought to attention that she was in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our conversation only lasted a few minutes. I was soon found by Alberta and brought back into the palace. Four years after that, until now, we haven't seen each other. When the topic of marriage proposal was brought up, I was shocked. I believed it was a special opportunity that God had granted me. I absolutely couldn't miss it. I... researched information on how it would be of political interest if Drossel and Flügel united, as much as I could. I continuously talked about nothing but that with Father and the parliament members during our dinners. I don't know if it was because of this, but in the end, Drossel chose Flügel."</p>
<p class="null-p">The illusion of a person that Charlotte appeared to be looking at in a part of the garden had already disappeared from her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yet, I... became very scared after everything was settled. I'm so happy about this wedding that I can't help it, but I what about that person? Perhaps he already had someone in his heart, but wasn't able to marry them because of me. Was it okay for me to decide on that person just because he was kind to me only once? Even though I'm an asset for Drossel's sake, I'm mixing my feelings into this, so what will I do if it leads to a result that will work out for the citizens afterwards? There's an age gap between that person and I. We might not be on the same wavelength. Without my status as princess, I'm nothing but a crybaby girl. He might come to hate me at some point. If that happens, how should I keep on living in an unfamiliar country away from my homeland...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She continued pondering in endless worry over such things. Her head was filled with her own reasoning and helplessly noisy. Her anxiety overflowed subsequently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think and think, and then everything starts to become a chore."</p>
<p class="null-p">With her consciousness back to reality, Charlotte unsteadily lowered her head and fell prostrate onto the table,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those letters are all frauds. I can't see in them what I or that person really think. This unclear situation... gnaws at my heart like a disease and makes me unstable."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying no more than that, Charlotte closed her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surrounding them from afar, the women who were watching over the duo's tea party moved their necks as if nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having her forehead against the cool table had chased away her idle thoughts for a little, but her head soon started soliloquizing once again. Tears wound up slowly forming in Charlotte's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">We haven't even sealed our marriage yet; I look like an idiot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet she was so, so anxious that she could not withstand it. She was inevitably afraid of every day, of the present moment and of the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte, you are a crybaby."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a bristleless, warm and gentle voice tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte looked at Violet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet had stood up from her seat. She had the face of someone who had made some sort of decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bringing one finger to her lips, Violet whispered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"We, Auto-Memories Dolls, are the ghostwriting Dolls of our clients. We do nothing outside of our role. That is why what I am about to do... is an obtruding action of my original self, same as Lady Charlotte putting down the tiara. Please be aware that this is unrelated to my firm, the CH Postal</p>
<p class="null-p">Service."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you intend to do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will go on an excursion. The truth is the writing of the Auto-Memories Doll from the other side rang a bell with me. That avid and charming manner of entreaty... If it is from the person I have in mind, she will most likely offer assistance. I will go see her."</p>
<p class="null-p">She meant to say she planned to visit the Capital of Woods across the river. What on earth was she plotting?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wish to stop your tears."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's figure as she whispered so while standing amidst the lush vegetation looked like nothing but gleaming light to Charlotte, who was unable to see the world properly due to her tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she asked why, Violet merely responded that she did not know and simply wanted to do it. While observing her, for some reason, Charlotte concluded that, if it were that AutoMemories Doll, she would be able to lead her to a good direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">To Charlotte, who lived in a world of egotism and would continue doing so from now on as well, that Auto-Memories Doll was much too innocent and there was no falsity in her. "I understand, Violet. I'll leave it to you. Please."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">A few days thereafter, a public love letter was delivered from Flügel.</p>
<p class="null-p">In actuality, Drossel's side was supposed to be the one in turn to send a letter. Such situation had never happened before in history.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, do you remember me from that night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The contents of the letter were nothing but that. There were no words of love or ardent sighs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Expectant as they had been of fervently pleading words, the civilians fell into bewilderment. However, the ones bewildered were not the people of Drossel alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, I do. You laughed upon seeing my crying face, right? You laughed as if poking fun at me ‐ or, putting it negatively, as if making a fool out of me. I was very irritated. However, I always reminisce to the kindness of your voice back when you said that it was okay for me to cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">The citizens of Flügel, too, were skeptical at the text delivered from Drossel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, I laughed because you crying like anyone of your age would was cute. It's not like I had any ill intent. But I'm sorry. My title is of prince, yet I don't have the personality everyone wishes for. You might be shocked after we get married. Please don't look forward to a mature man just because I'm ten years older than you. What about you? We've only seen each other once, on that night. What kind of girl are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The princess and prince had suddenly initialized a letter exchange with informal vocabulary. The population started a scandal about what the meaning of it was. Even those who had no interest in royal affairs found amusement in the rumors of astonishment about them breaking the tradition.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Drossel's princess and Flügel's prince are exchanging love letters for real.' they would say.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, I am... a crybaby and hot-tempered. I always mope over small things and get scolded by Alberta. Alberta is a court lady who is something like my caretaker. I'm surely not the kind of young woman that would make you go crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">There were people who questioned the royal palaces about it, but neither of the countries had an answer. That raised further awareness. The ones concerned were probably not expecting it, but were gathering attention from both nations as never before in the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, I'm also not that great of a human being. But, I'm used to crybaby girls. I have a little sister as my youngest sibling. She's as old as you. I embrace sad and negative feelings at that. I plan to cherish you, but I don't have enough charm to make you go crazy about me either. Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">The princess and prince exposed everything and hid nothing within the range appropriate for their ages.</p>
<p class="null-p">Voices of criticism came sporadically from veterans that honored the tradition, yet the youths mostly had faith in the exchange and piped down the repelling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, no, I am already</p>
<p class="null-p">crazy about you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte appended words together as nothing but one girl, while Damian continued to dedicate texts with no lies or fakeness to her as nothing but one young man.</p>
<p class="null-p">The citizens watching over the unadulterated letters of the two, which were unlike the first love letters of mutual feelings interchanged at the beginning, grew worried. Eventually, they even started sending letters of encouragement to each palace.</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to the sentiments of the public, the letters' exchange accelerated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, the me of those letters wasn't my actual self. They were written by a skilled Auto-Memories Doll."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, I was not referring to you from those letters. I meant you who patted my head four years ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, I'm seriously surprised. I mean, I merely consoled you when you were crying just once."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, I treasure this 'just once' like a gemstone."</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that memories of the past had sprouted her romantic feelings was what Charlotte had wanted to convey to Damian the most. Until reaching such point, Charlotte had disposed of countless sheets of stationary into a wastebasket. She would write and discard, write and discard, and, after being scolded by Alberta about wasting government funds,</p>
<p class="null-p">she thoroughly practiced her handwriting with small letters on a single sheet and later made a clean copy of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet mostly took the role of guidance regarding the texts. The contents were Charlotte's unadorned feelings. She simply worked to make sure the latter would write neatly as to transmit her sincerity only with words to the other party. Charlotte's handwriting, neither bad nor beautiful, improved before her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same speed as the love grew.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, I'm overwhelmed. That wasn't my intention. Please don't create prospects of me. There are countless men much dreamier out there. You'll have encounters with several people in the process of growing into an adult, too. I'm insensitive and don't get how women think. I believe I'll constantly leave you alone and go hunting. I'm aware that I'm no fine man. I can't answer your hopes."</p>
<p class="null-p">To anyone who saw it, Damian's reaction was obviously unfavorable. In his viewpoint, the marital union with Charlotte was plainly a political marriage. From the very beginning, no love existed there. Although he had consideration for the young princess who was below him in age, the passion that a man would offer to a woman was not mixed in it. However, Charlotte even so wrote a letter containing her unalloyed thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Damian Baldur Flügel, pardon my words, but I have been courted by numerous young men. Ever since I turned ten years old. What kind of person is a "wonderful man"? One with beautiful looks? One from a rich country? I think a wonderful person is the type that comes in contact with others without being untruthful to themselves. Amidst people who have but their outside polished as if it were glass, you are the only one I know who has said you are not a fine man. I am all right with that. It is all right this way. Should you go hunting, so will I. Please do not underestimate a princess from Drossel. We are educated to marry any sort of gentleman. If it is long rides, I am faster than you." After transcribing, Charlotte regretted it many times.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why had she not been able to write in a more lovable way? If it would turn out in that manner, rather than conveying her own views, would it not have been better to leave it to Violet?</p>
<p class="null-p">She distressed Alberta with her specialty ‐ her hot temper. Nevertheless, whether she cried or laughed, there was no way to stop the letter that had already been sent.</p>
<p class="null-p">The citizens, too, were holding their breaths.</p>
<p class="null-p">The last letter from Damian went as below:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel, my, my, I feel that you'll beat me to being considerate. By the looks of it, seems like my future bride is a clever, headstrong and interesting person. You'll make a great queen. Let's get married. I'm off to pick you up,</p>
<p class="null-p">Milady."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the day said letter was affixed and made public, the cheering of the citizens echoed loud enough to be heard sfrom the castle.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">It was customary for the sealing of the marriage to occur in the princess's country. Afterwards, a nationwide festival would take place for a week. The people would see off the bride as she wed into the groom's nation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte Abelfreyja Drossel was clad in a white chiffon dress, just as she had been on her tenth birthday. The difference was the fact that such dress was a so-called wedding one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having completely finished dressing up, she sat by the windowsill, observing the country that she had been born in and would depart from within a few days. From the window of the dressing room, the city around the castle's premises was visible. Said city basked in great bliss at the marital union of the young duo from the two nations.</p>
<p class="null-p">In both countries, the national flags interconnected one house to the other and the streets showered in storms of white and red confetti that represented white camellias and Flügel roses. The bulletin boards in which only the parts of the exchange that came from the duo had been presented to the public were turning into visit spots for lovers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Violet somewhere in that multitude?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Charlotte muttered intermittently, Alberta, who was watching over her unstable self by her side before the signing ceremony, answered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"She is probably already leaving the country. The truth is</p>
<p class="null-p">that her job ended as soon as the last letter was written. Since you made her stay for a few more days, it will likely affect her next duty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being told something callous, Charlotte puckered her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because I'd wanted her to see me wearing this dress. I did manage to have her take a look in the end. It's thanks to her that I'm not tossing off my tiara and crying right now. Violet requested the amanuensis of the other side to make Lord Damian write letters with his own words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can also be said that she tainted the tradition... In actuality, those of royal clans must not expose their real selves. Absolutely do not forget you must revolve with dignity, as to set an example for the people."</p>
<p class="null-p">The subject was one that ached in Charlotte's ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">The abrupt change of direction caused by the two AutoMemories Dolls was a deed that had overturned the history of the Public Love Letters of until then.</p>
<p class="null-p">To entrust something to an Auto-Memories Doll was likely marked in antiquity as exchanges with beautiful phrasing. No one could compliment theirs or consider it a proper way of writing letters. It did not contain neat handwriting or words that could shake others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The governess that occupied the first seat of court lady of the Drossel Kingdom, who was over seventy years old, smiled bitterly as she spoke,</p>
<p class="null-p">"In my long time working in the court, these were the Public Love Letters that will linger in my heart the most. Yes... in a good sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte directed a stunned look at how a statement other than one of rebuttal had come from the old woman that would always only throw strict words at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moving slowly, Alberta knelt down and took Charlotte's hands, which were enveloped in long silk gloves. Her own hands, covered in wrinkles, were the ones that had been coming for Charlotte's aid ever since she was a baby. As they squeezed Charlotte strongly, even her heart tightened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Charlotte, are you not anxious anymore?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely changing from the ceremonious court lady face of a moment before, Alberta asked with the expression of a gentle elderly woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the question, Charlotte's entire body was assaulted by an indescribable loneliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am. I'm always anxious. I actually feel like crying even now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice delated her wish to cry. She firmly bit her lips as they trembled uneasily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You must not cry. It will end up dissolving your precious make-up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to marry into where Lord Damian is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I don't want to part ways with my country."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yet what I don't want the most... isn't to be separated from my father or mother, but from you, Alberta."</p>
<p class="null-p">Charlotte squeezed Alberta's hands back. The palms that used to feel big when she was a child now seemed quite small.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, I look like an idiot. I really am selfish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right then, at that instant ‐ that moment in which she did not yet belong to him ‐ she was thinking about how she wished to return to her childhood, where merely being spoiled by Alberta was enough. Back in the times when they would always walk holding hands, she simply did not ponder over her own nervousness towards the future or the meaning of her existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">I... want to go back to being a child, when just following you was enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, Charlotte had already grown up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say something of that sort, even this old lady will cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to help themselves, the two women embraced each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't cry. If you do, I won't be able to hold it in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Princess... out of the princesses I've raised, you were the smartest and most toilsome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop it, I said... Aah, the tears are already..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Stroking Charlotte's hands as if to warm them up, Alberta whispered something.</p>
<p class="null-p">It gave place to the trail of a single teardrop on her cheek, decorated as it had been with rice powder and blush.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Princess Charlotte. Please find happiness."</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite them not having blood relations, that voice of hers reached Charlotte as the tone of a mother.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">A lone small boat sailed across the river that separated the territories of Drossel and Flügel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Arriving at the riverside of Flügel, a land of greenery and sunshine, a woman handed copper coins to the boatman and disembarked. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat ornamented with white camellias, said woman mutely moved forward onto firm land.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while, she reached an uncluttered plain. The woman's blue orbs caught sight of someone clad in a dresscoat of a red shade that was ardent even. Said person, whose large travel bag was on the ground as she squatted down, waved upon taking notice of the woman. She was a captivating beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">The closer to the ends, the laxer her dark hair was. Her finely shaped ears and earrings modeled after the Moon were but a little bit visible. Her almond-shaped amethyst eyes were a part of her allure. The front of the dress-coat with a waist ribbon tight around her voluptuous body was slovenly open, half-displaying her milky white cleavage. Her height was conspicuous once she quickly stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two were of different types. If Violet was as impeccably beautiful as a pottery doll, the aura, flirtatious look and many gestures of the woman clad in the dress-coat possessed a devilish exquisiteness that spoke volumes about her glossiness and sex appeal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">While calling for each other's names, they approached one another.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya, who was taller than Violet, nimbly took the hat that the latter was wearing once she came to her side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that? Did you always have a hat on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I received it from the princess. It seems that female attendees of their ceremonies wear dress-hats like this as accessory. I was unable to attend, but I was given it as commemoration. It will be a good sunblock."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is definitely expensive, isn't it? No way, it's got white camellias made of jewelry. So adorable. Gimme?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decline."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet, you're indebted to me this time round, right? Convincing Lord Damian was a hassle, after all. That person kicked up a fuss about how he couldn't possibly write a letter to a girl and how embarrassing it was, like 'wah~, wah~'. So gimme that as a token of gratitude towards me, the one who had a hard time."</p>
<p class="null-p">A wink and air kiss were blown. The person on the receiving end did not budge an inch of her facial expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you say so, then what happens to the countless instances in which I accepted changing places with you for assignments,</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Whistling instead of answering, Cattleya put on the hat without permission. Then, she spun around in twirls to show it off. The hem of her dress-coat swayed flutteringly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How's it?" Her figure as she laughed and stroke a pose was of a loveliness that erased her luster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When Cattleya wears it, an adult charm comes to light."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because Violet's response was different from what she had wanted, Cattleya puckered her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say it's 'cute'. Even I myself am concerned about that. It'd be okay if I had a face like yours, though. If so, I'd be able to wear as much lace and frills as I pleased."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya, would it not be all right if you wear those as well? Surely they would look good on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't wear them. I mean, this is the kind of outfit that the</p>
<p class="null-p">President picks for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet observed the main charm of Cattleya's dress-coat ‐ the cleavage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Must the front be that wide-open?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There're no buttons from here up. It's the President's taste."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I believe it must be cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's what you comment on? Well... I myself know it's a selling point, though this is a sad thing... Hey, let's go eat now or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am in a hurry, so I will pass. I must head as fast as possible to where my next client is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really unfriendly. Didn't our company just inaugurate? Don't you have any intention of getting along with your colleague Doll? I wanna eat meat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What might you be going on about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About the meal you'll treat me to. We'll be even this time if you do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I said, I was going to rush ahead..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Those flowers are pretty! I've never seen them before!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya simple-mindedly walked forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet followed her, seemingly having no other choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya, please return the hat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dooon't wanna. If I return it, you'll leave before me, won't you? Now look at these flowers. How pretty. Ah, should this big sis make you a flower crown?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's sunny. Good weather for a wedding today. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From the opposing shore, the sounds of the gun salutes could no longer be heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">The golden-haired Auto-Memories Doll turned around once. She was able to see the castle, almost as if it were reflected on a water surface.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that is right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's voice tone was soft, even for herself, "It is a fine wedding weather."</p>
<p class="null-p">The lovely little flowers bloomed along the green road. Not losing to said flowers, the figures of the two women side-byside were just as beautiful as them.</p>
<p class="null-p">The spread-out land was endless. The two Auto-Memories Dolls then started walking towards their next masters.</p>
<p class="null-p">All the while thoroughly appreciating the wonderful moment.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 02: Eternity and the Auto Memory Doll</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl stared up at a red brick building that had a weathercock on its top.</p>
<p class="null-p">While the girl stood by the roadside, people incessantly entered and exited that postal company of slightly oldfashioned exterior. A young man carrying a package. A young woman holding a letter to a beloved someone under her arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">The windows seemed already open.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within the site, a postman mounted his motorcycle while yawning. A bewitchingly beautiful woman came after him in trots. Clicking his tongue at her as she forcefully took over the passenger seat, the youth made a face that did not seem at all dissatisfied from an angle she could not see.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lively laughter could be heard from the balcony of the third floor. So could the voice of a young woman that was angry for whatever reason. Eventually, a man made his way to the balcony with a teacup in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">He spotted the girl, who was nothing but a part of the cityscape, and candidly wave at her despite it being their first meeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, a young woman of lustrous blond hair revealed herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a place noisier and more valuable than what she had imagined. For the girl, that place was a dreamy one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Firmly grasping the white dress she was clad in, she stepped forward. And, at the same time, she recited a magic spell.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">As I woke up, the first thing that entered my vision were slowly descending golden curtains.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is morning, Milady."</p>
<p class="null-p">Illuminated by the early sunlight from beyond the balloonshade lace curtains, her hair looked like it was glowing, even in my dim line of sight. Its color was comparable to the Moon, the stars and rice ears. It changed depending on the moment one gazed at it. That person herself was an elusive beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning started out like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pulling my blanket away, I sat up and reached for the chest next to my bed. The object inside it, made of nothing more than two thin glass plaques, greatly increased my field of vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amongst the many goods sent to me by someone who I was not yet certain if I should call "father", my glasses were my allies. And I had one more ally as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today, you are to have dance practice after the end of lectures. Time has come for you to step into the next stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is nearly nothing to correct in your way of walking. Please have confidence. Afterwards, let us practice transcribing spoken material."</p>
<p class="null-p">A handmaiden of blue orbs that were attractive to an odd extent.</p>
<p class="null-p">No ‐ in reality, she was not one at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">The truth was that she was an Auto-Memories Doll dispatched for my sake. But I was not supposed to let others know about it. We had to deceive everyone in the academy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I am Isabella York.</p>
<p class="null-p">Half a month had passed ever since we started having a routine together, but I had never seen the sleeping face of the Auto-Memories Doll that went to sleep later and woke up earlier than I did.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">I had heard that the property of the academy I attended had once been a rose plantation belonging to an extinguished country, which had existed in the distant past. The school where four hundred types of roses were planted was enveloped in fragrances to the point of making one cough during the warm periods of blossoming.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ground could be seen from the schoolhouse, hidden as it was in a mountain range, but people would never be able to catch a glimpse of the building from outside. The only ones allowed to live there inside of secluded rooms were young women and handmaidens that had permission to stay for a fixed period alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">What protected the ladies like a knight was a tall fence that blocked the air from the outer world. It surrounded and enclosed the school building. Those allowed to enter were solely relatives, future fiancés and teachers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amongst the teachers, there were no males. It was essentially a girls' garden. A life completely packed within a box, in which we were not permitted to return home once we enrolled, except during long-term vacations.</p>
<p class="null-p">The circumstances of the students varied, but they consisted of those meant to take a social position of high status or settled to marry someone with said position eventually. If I were to say it, I was probably the latter.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had a negotiation and made an agreement with my father to sell over the whole rest of my life. Being thrown into such a school had unmistakably been the result of him wanting me to be polished into a fine product.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What color of ribbon will it be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, she intended to turn my wine-red hair into tight and firm braids.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reflected in the dresser mirror, she and I wore the same uniform. It was a pure white cape over dark blue one-piece, white socks and red shoes. The ornaments specified by the academy were all items that made perceivable the excellence of their quality.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Red..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her fingers, all the while covered by long white gloves, tied the ribbon for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every now and then, a creaking mechanical noise would ensue. Since she and I were sleeping in the same room with our beds next to each other, I knew that the cause of said noise were her prosthetics.</p>
<p class="null-p">I quite liked the sound. I believed it to be a part of her robot-like self that had a hint of humanity. The meaning of those words was contradictory, but that was it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once both of the three-strand braids were done, I turned around and said,</p>
<p class="null-p">"You... always wear your hair like that, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at my reflection in the mirror, she nodded pointedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">That type of braiding did not seem like something I could possibly do. It did not dishevel no matter how much she moved around the whole day, so it was probably a wellthought hairdo. But the way it looked when loose was more charming. If I were to talk about her slovenliness before going to sleep...</p>
<p class="null-p">I fleetingly glanced outside the room's window.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were still only a few students heading from the dormitory to the school building. I then stood up from the chair that I had been sitting on and went around to behind her.</p>
<p class="null-p">While laughing at how wary she became of her back, I eased her with a, "there, there" and made her sit down. And so, I undid her perfect braiding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hum, Milady. That would be troubling. You will not make it in time to the morning lessons."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. You know, I used to be... a pro at braiding my little sister's hair. I can do it quick. Your hair feels like velvet to the touch... Seems like it would sell for an expensive price."</p>
<p class="null-p">Vile thoughts made their way out of my mouth accidentally.</p>
<p class="null-p">Letting me do as I pleased, she furrowed her brows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You will sell it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huhu... I won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">I earned a slightly pleasant feeling from her face, expressionless by default, clouding over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone at my workplace tells me to 'keep it long'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. I also think so. See, while we were talking about that, I finished it."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a very simple pair of braids. Wavy streaks dangled as traces of the hair that had been braided on the spots a little above her ears. Her adult-like impression had faded off quite a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have the feeling that it appears childish."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I think it's cute, though... Then, I'll make these into buns... Look, it's a sheep-horn hairstyle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It does not go well with the uniform."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed, this chaste-looking dress is too much for a cheerful head. What should I do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady, you are playing with me, are you not?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I got caught?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please stop fooling around. Also, I have told you this numerous times, but please use proper obligatory language.</p>
<p class="null-p">All right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was inexpressive and hard to read, but it seemed I had angered her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I would meekly say "yes" only at times like those, but other than when we were alone together, I did not intend to fix that. Because it would be suffocating.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, we ran out of time, so she wound up accompanying me with her hair untied.</p>
<p class="null-p">From what I heard later on, she apparently did not quite like to have her hair down. According to her, that was because it could hinder her field of vision if the wind blew and cause grave accidents when she was doing something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Going by that logic, I felt that having a hair so lengthy was not a good thing in itself, but it matched her, so there was no helping it. The opinions of the people from her workplace added up to it as well. Even I wanted to tell her to keep it long.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strangely enough, even though she was the kind of person that did not seem to need others, she made others feel like they should not leave her on her own. I was a little jealous of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady, a daughter of the York household cannot be tardy</p>
<p class="null-p">by any means. Please hurry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mixing with the students that rushed to the school building, we walked through a red brick path.</p>
<p class="null-p">The school building was far from the dormitory. But that path was surrounded by trees and flowers and extremely lovely. Since I had been raised in a land of greenery, it made me want to stop and stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'll get scolded by the nuns if we run."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let us go at a fast pace." "Ahahah, what's up with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She pulled my hand and trotted.</p>
<p class="null-p">While looking at her, I was thinking, Just how many people in this world wouldn't think of me as someone of no importance?</p>
<p class="null-p">I pondered on that while racing up. Nobody but my little sister came to mind. However, she was only a three-year-old toddler.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would call for me with a "hey, hey" without ever having pronounced my name properly.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I did not want to supply my musings with her, I said to the one in front of me,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey! How about we don't go to class but to some other place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I wondered what she was doing now. Wondered if she was</p>
<p class="null-p">not hungry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">My adorable little sister. Her sweet voice was sometimes irritating, sometimes endearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doesn't matter! Let's go together... The weather is so good."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had marigold-colored, fluffy and curly angel-like hair. There was a softness to her puffy cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanna go somewhere. It would be reassuring if I were with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">All of it was nostalgic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We cannot leave this academy, Milady."</p>
<p class="null-p">All of it was nostalgic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We cannot go anywhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words froze my heart, and I ended up halting in my tracks.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was merely stating the truth, so she was not at fault for anything. She was not at fault.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have to lie at times like these. Be nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet I wound up accidentally speaking in a thorny way.</p>
<p class="null-p">She soon uttered an, "I am terribly sorry." and deeply lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt displeased.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was wrong... It was not what I had been after.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not as if I wanted to make use of my position to stand above like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm-hm, I was the one in the wrong just now. Sorry." I had just wanted her to treat me as a friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once I drew her hand closer, I rested my head on her shoulder. Mutely, I was requesting her to pat my head. No, it might be that I was wishing for us to be something like lovers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she had already grown used to that, as she caressed me with her artificial arm even without me saying anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">The students passing by were looking at us. There would probably be rumors about us again. That the daughter of the York house and her handmaiden had an unusual relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever. As of now, I did not need any allies other than her.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Miss York. Wouldn't you have a meal with us sometime?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the academy, where one's surname was their own name, I was well-known as "Miss York".</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that, when traced back, the York family came across the lineage of some royal household. If I was certain, it was Drossel or something.</p>
<p class="null-p">In my first encounter with the person who had been assigned as my handmaiden role, she had explained to me that she had been introduced to Drossel as well. I had thought she was an uncanny beauty during the first time we had met. Since she was so dear to me now, the so-called human emotions were unbelievable to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">To bring back the subject, it appeared that the fact the York house had relations to a royal family was superb, but was getting involved with me something so highly honorable?</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because of that, fellow classmates I was not very well-acquainted with would often come talk to me. Like, "Won't you affiliate with the Salon?". Or, "I want to be your friend.". Or, "My father is in your father's debt.". They would one-sidedly grant me information. Even though I would never ask them anything along the lines of, "Please tell me about it.".</p>
<p class="null-p">Meaning that forming a connection with me equaled increasing the prestige of my classmates' statuses.</p>
<p class="null-p">- My, my, even if the social positions change, the true nature of people stays the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at her and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just smiling would not earn me anything. To be honest, I was not allowed to talk much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My apologies. It seems that Milady would rather refrain from it this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was because, if I were to speak carelessly, the crude part of me would end up exposed. Until I was done with my "education", she would act as my representative for all sorts of matters. As a rule, we were only allowed to bring in handmaidens for three months after enrolling into the academy, so from that point onward, I would have to do everything by myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You declined it last time saying the same thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Which was why I would steal and copy the ways of dealing with those kinds of situations from her, my mentor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady's body is not stout, and she has been living her girlhood being able to spend a large amount of time by herself. She is not accustomed to life in an organization. She soon becomes feverish from talking with strangers. If you could wait for now until Milady becomes familiar with the academy routine... We know the names and pedigree of people who have come talk to her. She will most likely be the one making invitations eventually."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is that so? Then it's all right. Well, Miss York, good day to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a perfectly lady-like manner of refusal, which did not cause either us or the other party to lose face. The refused classmate also did not seem to have taken it with ill intent. She quickly left together with other friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should we do now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a rule that the entire school body had to eat at the cafeteria.</p>
<p class="null-p">The atrium-like structure of said cafeteria, which also had terrace seats, bore an air of spaciousness. Even if all three hundred students and the whole academy's staff had a meal together at the same time, it possessed more than enough seats to accommodate them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Depending on the time of the year, seasonal events were held there as well. From that point on, the place would be prepared for a ball. I had to get ready for it too. I did not want to, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady, what will you be eating?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm troubled. I feel like having noodles today."</p>
<p class="null-p">Each of us had to order our meals out of a predetermined menu to the personnel. I would have fun ordering different things each time, but in the end, I settled for eating a rich noodle soup with plenty of seafood that she recommended me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Auto-Memories Dolls journeyed around the world, they were knowledgeable of the noted products and delicacies of given regions. Noodles had a flavor worthy of praise. She said so upon making the decision, putting tealeaves mixed with rose petals into a pot, and I wondered if she was not going to eat anything solid, or even a single bread.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you get hungry like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a meal box with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She finished eating in a matter of few seconds, commenting on my aspect and my attitude regarding my surroundings while drinking the black tea afterward.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had not asked about her personal history, but her actions were just like that of the bodyguards who would be around my father. They ate extremely fast as well. They would do so because they could not grab their weapons fast enough while eating. I also ate fast. In my case, it was because I used to live in an environment where I had no idea when I would be able to get food again if I did not eat on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">I suppressed my wish to take the dish in my hands and drink the remainder of the soup with big gulps, scooping it with the spoon. As I ate, I noticed that she had been observing one point all the time. There was a girl coming towards the direction past us in a hesitant pace after having placed postmeal cakes and tea on a tray.</p>
<p class="null-p">- Uwah, seems like she'll drop it.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the instant I thought that, the girl stumbled over nothing. The fact there existed a girl who could trip so prettily in a way that could be called exhilarating was startling even. I could easily imagine the disaster that would be brought about</p>
<p class="null-p">I readied myself for the three types of cake flying towards me as I squeezed my eyes shut.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, no matter for how many seconds I braced myself for that reality, the future I had predicted did not come.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I fearfully opened my eyes, which had been firmly closed, there she was, embracing the girl's waist with one hand and holding the tray with the other. Although some of them collapsed, the items that had flung midair were secured.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you all right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She, whose background was unknown and who frequented</p>
<p class="null-p">the academy by playing the role of my handmaiden, displayed wonderful gentlemanly manners.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The cheeks of the girl who had been safely secured along with the cakes were tinted pink.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was jealous that she was able to look into those blue orbs and be talked to with that skylark-like voice from a very near distance. It seemed many people thought the same, for shrill voices rose from somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let us be careful and go to your table together. Milady, I will leave you for a moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded elegantly, gesturing lightly for her to take care of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was rude of me, if I were to describe the nervousness of the girl being escorted by her, who walked so gracefully, it was laughable. There was no helping it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within one month of attendance, she would occasionally be assisting people, just like me. There was no end to the students who idolized that courteous style in addition to her appearance, voice and way of carrying herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">How could I put it? Perhaps she was a person who could easily... become someone admired in a girls-only garden. Her looks were of an incredible beauty, but the inside was manly, so to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, it was a bit different from that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a firm core and was worth being relied upon. Seemed cold but was kind. Gave off a feeling of absolute reassurance. Her figure as she always stood reserved by my side at a reasonable distance was almost like that of a knight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes. Everyone wanted to be protected. Not from a specific foreign enemy, but from the many sorts of uncertainties that we shouldered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to that, I had known for a long time now that she was secretly referred to as "Lady Knight Princess".</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is it for the review of today's class... Now, then, I would like to start dance practice."</p>
<p class="null-p">The lessons of the day generally ended at dusk. Afterward, as a rule, we would go back to our room and redo the contents of the classes. After all, I had never received tuition that could actually be called an education. There were many things I did not know. She had been the one dispatched to me also so that I could take lessons in secrecy with the best teacher and cover up the gap between myself and the other students.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our contract period was of three months. We had twenty days left. I would have to go through self-studies from thereafter. I could manage my lessons even through selfstudy, but I could not do that about conversational skills, manner of carrying myself or dancing. The fact that she had a relation to Drossel had been the main cause behind her selection, but there were other reasons.</p>
<p class="null-p">The person who had invited her had been a caretaker of</p>
<p class="null-p">the royal family that did the so-called role of wet nurse, and she seemed to have detected a talent for lecturing in the latter back when she had previously hired her as Auto-Memories Doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">Had she served as mediator by saying that there was a fine and capable person around just when my father had been contemplating about whom to have for teaching such a toilsome girl in secret? I had no idea if that woman knew of my true circumstances, but I believed she had made a superb decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amongst Auto-Memories Dolls, there were many who had received lady-like education and who were young girls, on top of that. It was also easy for them to infiltrate as handmaiden. Had it been a private tutor that just graduated from college, there was a possibility that she would be too old, and more than anything, it was not as if she would be extensively refined.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that way, it maybe could be said that the so-called Auto-Memories Dolls were lady role models who would not cause embarrassment no matter where they turned in. It probably depended on each person, though. At the very least, she was qualified. I was not one to talk, but I had a feeling that she was used to dealing with troublesome people.</p>
<p class="null-p">I let out a heavy sigh, "Are we seriously gonna do this? I'll... definitely end up stepping on your feet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is not a matter of being able to do it or not; it is an indispensable element that you must see to."</p>
<p class="null-p">She told me flatly as I expressed objection with my sharp tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Knight Princess, you're scary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you say something just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With an icy gaze directed at me, I rapidly shook my head left and right, "No... I didn't, I didn't. Is it okay if we do it wearing the uniform?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should actually wear a dress... but Milady's dress is not ready yet, so we shall do it like this until it arrives. I will do the male role. Your right hand..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was delighted only about holding her hand. I fixed my posture according to what she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The next event is called a ball, but it is a dance party. There will be no problems if you so much as learn the most basic steps of waltz. I believe it is all right not to adhere too much to formalities. The goal is to enjoy it while chatting with your schoolmates. Milady, in order for you not to be troubled when you receive invitations, I shall have you perform both the male and female roles."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hands rounded my back and our bodies came closer at once. My chest that particularly did not form a cleavage and her chest that looked slender under clothing touched, and my cheeks unwittingly grew red.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you were gonna kiss me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"May I ask why you thought so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow... When bodies are so close together, don't you feel like doing it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do not. I will not."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being taught by someone with not seem to have a single ounce of sexual desire withered my will as well. Reluctantly, I decided to take the dance lesson seriously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The natural position is not to stand straight forward but to turn half of your body to the side a little... Yes, and with my hand touching the area of Milady's shoulder blade. The elbows must not shake. They tend to shake as we move, but have a horizontal line in mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was quite difficult to bear straightness in mind. It made me aware of how loose a posture I normally had. My body trembled just from maintaining my pose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is difficult."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was difficult enough for me to become coquettish from all the long sighs and agony.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Accustom yourself to it. Let us repeat the same movement... Milady, please entrust yourself with the male role as we progress. Protecting your aide in a venue where other people are dancing as well is the male role. Leave your body to me... If you do not do so, I cannot protect you whenever it might seem that someone will bump onto us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I kinda... wanna move with more vigor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do; please feel my movements... match my breathing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like... my breathing will stop. It really is excruciating, like my body is strained."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will soften with time. Do it slowly in no hurry."</p>
<p class="null-p">If I were to describe her teaching, it was as though only the "stick" part had been extracted from "carrot and stick".</p>
<p class="null-p">I was exhausted from fatigue just by doing that for ten minutes. Perhaps because I had continued to do it with my neck bent backwards, the muscular pain soon started acting up. I had completely grown sick of dance by break time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rolling onto my room's bed, I hugged my pillow and shouted, "I wanna do something more fun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I flailed my legs to express displeasure, she repressed me without a moment's delay, "Your underwear is visible." Try as I might, it appeared that dancing did not suit me.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I briefly raised my face, she was staring down at me with a look that obviously seemed to say, "You are such a troublesome person."</p>
<p class="null-p">I yelled angrily in defiance, "I can't do everything as smoothly as you! You and I are different!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Different'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! Different in any and everything... You're unfair..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The difference was enough to go beyond making one feel jealousy and led them to the point of desistance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you so blessed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a pretty, intelligent and proud professional lady who could go anywhere. That was the opposite of me, who was henceforth merely going to be polished and sold off as the commodity so-called "woman". I was living in order to be eventually delivered to some old man who I had no idea how many years would be apart from me in age with a ribbon wrapped around me. As for her... I did not know what she was living for but she was able to make all sorts of decisions by herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could not choose anything on my own anymore. Because I had made a big choice once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady."</p>
<p class="null-p">She sat on the bed and nestled close to me. Then slowly pulled away a tuft of hair that had stuck to my mouth with her artificial fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was the fact that she had started giving me a mellow look only at times like those despite being expressionless all the time a proof of intimacy from spending the past couple of months with me? Or could it be...</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have tired you out a bit..."</p>
<p class="null-p">...a technique of hers? She was truly, truly... extremely kindhearted every now and then.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was being that gentle to me because she was paid to, but even so, such gentleness could become a habit. I decided to view her in a way that left me pondering over how that was surely the reason why she was famous in the Auto-Memories Doll business.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My deepest apologies for making you force yourself too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">She made people mistakenly feel almost as if they were more special than anyone else. Even someone like me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will bring hot water. Please go heal your exhaustion with a bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was being unreasonably told off by a selfish mistress, she did not give the slightest sign of irritation. I could not imagine her being angry, but there was a limit to how much one could bear up with in that situation. I felt like she had grown weary of me, like she had given up on me, and became anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if working on automatic, my hand moved. "I'll go too."</p>
<p class="null-p">I grabbed the hem of her skirt and sat up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady. The buckets are heavy for you to carry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't wanna make you carry it alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady, all you have to do is to act lady-like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will, I will. I'll become the Milady that you want in front of everyone. But, when we're just by ourselves..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because I was making such a desperate face, her eyes softened a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">We did about three round trips to fill my gold cat-leg porcelain tub with seethed boiling water for a hot bath and finally finished collecting the heated water. There was a large bathtub in the dormitory that everyone used collectively, but we did not fancy it. Her arms were prosthetics, and I did not want her to reveal her naked body to other people either.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she was about to exit the bathroom with a, "Well, then, take your time.", I detained her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go in together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you only go in after I leave, the water will have cooled down."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do not mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be happy if you go in with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady, I am not here to make you happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We always repeat this dialogue, but in the end, you lose your wit, so just agree upright."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had complete grasp of how weak she was to pressure.</p>
<p class="null-p">While it seemed like she wanted to say something, she uttered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"No helping it. However, please stop staring fixatedly at me when I am undressing. Please do not try to touch me without permission, either. I will quit this job the moment that any inappropriate actions take place."</p>
<p class="null-p">I regretted not being able to hide my ulterior motives.</p>
<p class="null-p">We immersed ourselves in the bathtub side by side. Although the tub was wide, it was narrow for two people to go in. She sat on the edge so as not to let her prosthetics touch the heated water to the best of her abilities, while I had my knees folded inside the tub.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was quite difficult not to stare up and down at her as she wiped her body with a cloth soaked in warm water. Unlike me, who had never done physical exercise, she had a toned body. The glossiness of her skin had a pearly gleam. She herself was the copy of a heavenly nymph from some painting. I believed that no one would manage not to pay attention to a woman with such a beautiful naked figure, regardless of gender.</p>
<p class="null-p">I brought up a subject as naturally as I could,</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, that girl... called you over at the end of class by the school building's entrance, right? See, the one who stumbled magnificently during lunch break."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah... My apologies for leaving your side that time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's fine. But didn't she do anything weird to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was not the kind of person who coaxes others into kissing like Milady does."</p>
<p class="null-p">I wondered if I was the most dangerous person in her perception.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, right... She gave me something in a wrap back then as gratitude. Those things that serve for applying color to nails... were they called 'nail polish'? There were countless types of them in it. But I am reflecting on how to use them since my hands are prosthetics."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her prosthetics impressively started from around the area of both her shoulders. They gave off the impression of being fake. Perhaps because of that, her humanness was indistinct. She really did seem like a mechanical doll. Of course, the flesh part of her was extraordinarily sensual and overflowed with charm, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under what sort of circumstances had she become like that? Had her arms been severed, had they rotted and fallen off? Her visible scars were not only those. From neck to toes, big and small scratches could be faintly spotted. "Is that so...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The war had ended just a few years before in our continent. Even without asking about her past, I somehow could guess it. In reality, arms of white and smooth skin had used to exist there just like her other parts. Even she, who could not be said to have the body of an adult, was supposed not to like the fact that her arms had been turned into artificial ones.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why I said especially lightly,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll paint your toe nails. When we get out of the bath. You already received it... so it's better to wear it for that girl's sake. She might have been happy just from you accepting it, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady..."</p>
<p class="null-p">She firmly squeezed her lengthy blond hair, water drops spilling from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady, you have not asked me about my arms even once."</p>
<p class="null-p">The droplets that fell down with dripping noises looked like hourglass sand. They made me conscious of my remaining time with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I approached her side and smiled. To express that molesting her was not what I intended to do, I raised both of my hands once. On top of that, I placed my cheek over her knee. It gave off the lukewarm feeling of a human being. I had imagined she would have the tender skin of a girl, but that was not the case.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/violet-evergarden/illustrations/violet-evergarden_vol_03_5.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"You also haven't asked me where or how I was living before becoming the daughter of a big-name millionaire."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since I was in love with her, I did feel like monopolizing her future, past and present. But people had things that they did and that they did not want to talk about. I was not very smart, yet I was aware of that much. Because it was valid for me as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what happened, I did not want to tell her about my past.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">That night, we went to sleep after having painted our toenails with matching colors of nail polish.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had a dream. A dream about my little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was eating pancakes with her. It was in some place that I did not recognize. A simple wooden house... the kind of home that people would use to describe a happy household.</p>
<p class="null-p">We had never eaten pancakes during the time we used to live together, so that might have been a manifestation of my desire. The desire of just eating something tasty with my little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could not properly hold onto the spoon yet, so I was feeding her. In the dream, we had poured plenty of honey and cream onto the pancakes and decorated them with cherry crowns. When I asked her if it was yummy, she beamed and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was so, so happy with that smile...</p>
<p class="null-p">And then I woke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Overcome as I was with a feeling of great joy that exceeded any pleasure and drug, I could not suppress my tears and coughs. I wiped my snot and tears with the sleeve of my negligee. It was not as if I wanted to cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, though, what a useless body function. Tears did not serve any purpose. I knew with all of my being that no one would help me out even if I wailed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to bear lying on my side, I sat up. The disease was more agonizing if I stayed laid down. Rubbing my wheezing chest, I desperately attempted to hold back the coughs.</p>
<p class="null-p">That disease had afflicted me ever since meeting my father, but it was no thread to my life. It was just that the coughs were painful.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wondered why that was happening. I was supposed to be happy right now. Yet my body complained about how unlucky and tormented it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had made a choice. For that child's sake, I could do my best at anything. I had honestly thought that I would be able to endure anything. I had been confident that such feeling would not fade no matter how many cold nights I had to live through. That did not change even as of late, where my situation was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Still, why am I feeling so pained?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady."</p>
<p class="null-p">A clear voice echoed throughout the bedroom that was enshrouded in night.</p>
<p class="null-p">My shoulders flinched as I turned my face towards the bed next to mine. I wondered for how long she had been awake, for she was looking at me. Her blue eyes were like candlelight in the slightly dark room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My cough won't..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will bring you water."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, no need. It's useless..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I am going over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">She came to my side before I asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gathering her own pillows and cushions from the sofa, she piled many of them up. As she placed them at my back, I was able to find a comfortable position even while seated.</p>
<p class="null-p">She also sat close to me, the two of us sharing a blanket. When I stretched out my hand, she held onto it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it hard for you to sleep if you can't lie down?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can sleep anywhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have an awful job, huh? Even though you're just an Auto-Memories Doll... you gotta spend three months with someone like me."</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was just for a bit more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no good or bad when it comes to work. Besides,</p>
<p class="null-p">my holding of Milady's hand right now is not my duty."</p>
<p class="null-p">My time with the only person who acted as ally in my academy life full of lies was scarce.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">I rested my head on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"... Hey, you're nice... but why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What might you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y'know, you're normally strict... but you're super nice at times like these, right? Why? Even though I was pretty disgusting. From the very start, you always..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Disgusting'...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if not understanding what I was talking about, she had a question mark overhead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't I tell you when we first met...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">'I have no intention to get familiar with you. So don't talk to me about anything other than the bare minimum needed for my tuition.'</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, I had been tossed into in a world I did not know, so every person that I saw used to look like an enemy to me. I had convinced myself that such a brazen beauty who had come over at an expensive price was also unmistakably scorning at me on the inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You indeed told me so. I was doing just as you ordered until half the way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha, because I took that order back... I am... horrible.</p>
<p class="null-p">You're... nice..."</p>
<p class="null-p">It had happened a week after enrollment, in the middle of the night. I had had a coughing fit due to emotional vertigo just like now. I remembered that she had reacted fast and raised her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a while, she had watched over me from the neighboring bed as I coughed. As she had merely stood observing, I had resented her, thinking about what a terrible person she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">-I don't have a single ally.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not as if I had been drunk on tragedy. But I had been unable to think anything other than that. Firmly suppressing tears, I had coiled up.</p>
<p class="null-p">-I won't lose; I can't stay weak like this. I got this cough because my feelings are feeble.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite my self-scolding, the cough had only worsened and did not get better. Although it was apparently an illness called asthma, there was no specific medicine for it. I could only wait for it to subside.</p>
<p class="null-p">-It's hard to breathe and there's nothing I can do.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had been on the verge of going crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">-I wanna sleep but I can't.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as I closed my eyelids and nodded off, the coughing had prevented my sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as I had been about to scream from that vicious cycle, I felt someone's touch against my back. My body had then convulsed with a start. I had never experienced someone doing something like that for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I bent my neck to look behind, I had found her mutely stroking my back. Albeit not saying anything, her gaze had seemed worried. She had carried on caressing my back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our eyes had met in the darkness, and she had opened her mouth once but then closed it. I had wondered why.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, I had realized it.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Aah, it's 'cause I...</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because I had told her not to talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like a machine, she had been faithfully following what I had said. That had probably been the reason why she had not asked if I was all right... Because I had ordered so myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had thought she was a terrible person.</p>
<p class="null-p">-I'm the one who's terrible...</p>
<p class="null-p">I had lay face-down, hiding my tears and letting her do as she pleased.</p>
<p class="null-p">-I'm all about myself, but this person is...</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hand had never stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Was I not actually the one being terrible to the world?</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, that thought had crossed my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because, see, I was supposed to be an unpleasant mistress from her point of view, yet she worried about me. She had been supposedly sleepy too. Saying that having to spend three months beside a cocky and unrefined little girl was some sort of punishment could not be considered a joke. Even so, she was kind.</p>
<p class="null-p">-She's nice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only when I was by her side could I think slightly gently of the world. I could feel that I was being taken care of.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just a little bit, my existence shone. In the world I so rejected, for the first time, I had been able to breathe in properly.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After that night had passed, I had remade my request to her. I had told her that, if she could, I wanted her to talk to me normally as a fellow girl who was close to her in age.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am nice...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, she remained with a questioning expression. It seemed she had no intention to do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at our matching toenails as our feet peeked out of the blanket and laughed, "You are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I am merely copying it. One time, when I was injured, the person who was with me left cushions for me like this so that the wounded part would not hurt. Thanks to him, I was able to sleep well that day. There was also a time when I got a fever from overwork, and he woke up many times at night to give me water."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she had been treated kindly, she would mimic it in a similar situation, was what she was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">I wondered how many people on this earth could manage to do that. How many of them understood the real meaning behind the merit of doing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady, if you cannot sleep, shall we talk about constellations? I am always studying them."</p>
<p class="null-p">People cared mostly about themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Kay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even being affectionate with others involved calculations and profits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let me tell you about the anecdote of the twin stars that twinkle in the night sky at this time of the year."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were properly able to comprehend the wonderfulness of natural kindness only after getting hurt a lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Kay."</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to become strong, I thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to have a soul that would stand tall no matter what winds and waves came at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted a heart of steel that would not budge, regardless of how much my sadness and loneliness attempted to kill me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, I wanted to accept several matters and be kind to people.</p>
<p class="null-p">I believed that surely her gentleness seeped so deeply into my flesh and bones was because she had been hurt in an equal amount. There were numerous scratches carved into her body. Were they not the same as the wounds in her heart? It was precisely because she was someone who had been hurt that her kindness was different from other people's.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not want to forget the emotion I was having at the time. That was what she made me feel.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Quick, quick, turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">We repeated dance practice over and over, and when the day of the ball arrived, a package was delivered to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had a mail in the name of my father.</p>
<p class="null-p">Countless large boxes were stacked in a corner of my room. Jewels, dresses and high-heel shoes revealed themselves as we unwrapped their cute casings. A part of them was for her as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon looking at the postal agency covering letter attached to the baggage, she made a face as though she were suppressing a sneeze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My dress was sent from my company's president... so the one who delivered it to the academy's gates was most likely a postman that I know. There is a scribble here."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the covering letter was the name of the postman, and next to it was a smile mark that seemed to have been drawn by a child. There was a speech bubble coming from the scribble, and on it were written the words, "You playin' around?".</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does this mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I imagine he wants to say, 'hurry back home'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My original occupation is ghostwriting, after all. The reason why I took on this job was that I received an invitation from the Drossel Kingdom, which has deep-rooted connections with the York household. Milady, this is a topic unrelated to you, but ever since being hired by them previously, I have received several job proposals... Even for a postal company, turning them down was a tough demand. As a request from the president, I am now here like this, but I myself have never been away from the agency for this long. It is also difficult to keep in touch with the outside world in this place, so I cannot report to them on a fixed term. This letter is probably his own way of showing concern."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice resounded more gently than usual as she spoke. The facial expression of just now might have been her biting back a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">-I see, so there are other people like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">If it were I of until a while before, my head would have surely filled up with jealousy. But after three months had passed, I had come to know what sort of person she was, and had come to know myself through her. The values of the human being that I was had reformed but a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">There had not been much change in her expression, but she seemed happy, so I was happy too. Of course, I felt loneliness as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you leave today, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Our contract will terminate as soon as the ball ends. I will depart tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's have lots of fun together... in the ball." I forced a laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Just a bit more left. I want the figure of myself that will stay within you to be something joyful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, then."</p>
<p class="null-p">-Because I'm fond of you. So I want you to place me in your good memories. Even if I don't become a part of your life, even if you forget me, even if I'm the only one who will remember, I want to make a little effort. For both the girl I like and the little sister I love, I want to be something good. I want to remain as something good.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could you escort me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I stretched out my hand and said so as a joke, yet she all too seriously nodded, raised one leg and kneeled down on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"With pleasure, Milady."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was called "Lady Knight Princess", there was no helping her coolness.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">My fingerless gloves were made of black lace embroidery. Bijou straps held my slender heeled shoes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not need my glasses. I had an escort, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">I placed a wreath woven with fresh flowers on my hair. My pastel pink square-neck satin dress, which seemed to make a laughable appeal to cuteness, was as light as a feather. A red panier that looked like piled-up roses was visible from underneath the ankle-length hem.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since I had only ever dressed modestly in the academy, the schoolmates I passed by whispered something at the discrepancy of impression that I brought about. No, perhaps it was not me. The person that they were supposedly spreading rumors about was someone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone's looking at you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her high-neck dress tightly buttoned up to her collar did not allow any distracting exposure. It was a full-fledged protection so-called a long-sleeve robe.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to commend the sense of the person that had chosen it. It concealed her arms of artificial mechanism in a splendidly elegant way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there anything strange about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. It means you're pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But everyone is dressed-up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the prettiest of all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Decorated with a braid, her long, long golden hair cascaded down from one side of her face. Seen from behind, her figure was most charming. Like stars, there were rose adornments here and there on her hair and dress. She herself was looking slightly doubtful, but her beauty was one that could be observed forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">The cafeteria had its appearance transformed and turned into a ball venue. Said venue, covered with white and blue glitter markings, was like a world made of night skies. Silver balloons flew and spread around over the atrium ceiling. Arranged on countless interconnected long tables were various delicacies that displayed the prowess of the academy's cooks.</p>
<p class="null-p">From meat dishes to fish dishes, one could eat gems of rich hues at the buffet. An overwhelming sense of presence wafted from cupcakes and cookies lined up in rows, which had icing applied even to their insides.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that the table coordination plan was committed as well. Flowers decorated the teacups, candlelight wavered from within glass blows and all glasses had chiffon ribbons tied around them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sublimely expensive, huh. Almost like a wedding ceremony. I've never attended one, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Should a land of dreams exist, I wondered if it would feel like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike me, who was nervous from being at my first time in such a situation, she was something majestic. Actually, she no different from normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shall we get ourselves something...? Is there anything you wish for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I rested a hand on my stomach and groaned, "My corset is tight so it doesn't seem like I'll be able to eat much... Hey, don't leave my side. My vision is pretty blurry. It's not like I can't see, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I promise. I will not leave your side."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as declared, although many people called to her, she did not leave my side.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the height of the banquet, volunteering students gathered up bringing instruments and started playing music. Everyone began swaying and, while blindly following an inspection on the melody, they went out into the dance hall with their partners.</p>
<p class="null-p">My stomach started hurting as that time at last arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">-If I fail, they'll find out that I'm not a girl of nobility.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such act that would stain the dignity of the York family. They might then become unable to go along with the conditions established in exchange of me carrying out the duty of successor.</p>
<p class="null-p">In spite of saying, "I don't wanna, I don't wanna", I had been doing my best for that sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Milady." someone whispered into my ear, causing me to have goosebumps.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned my whole body, which had become stiff from anxiety, toward her direction. The one standing beside me was...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please be at ease. Milady, your grasp of dance is perfect. I guarantee it."</p>
<p class="null-p">...my sole ally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be easy to trip with shoes that you are not used to. However, if you are concerned about stumbling down, it absolutely will not happen."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the only girl who knew of my circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, I will protect you."</p>
<p class="null-p">My girl, who was like a knight.</p>
<p class="null-p">-If you say so, there will be no failures. Because I know it. You don't tell lies, and you definitely fulfill your promises.</p>
<p class="null-p">It could be idiotic of me to believe so much in her even though we had only spent a few months together. If it were my former self, I would never let my guard down like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still...</p>
<p class="null-p">-Still, it's because it's you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, I trust you."</p>
<p class="null-p">-Because it's you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And thank you for until now; this is your last job." -Because it's you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll leave the man role to you, but do let me say it."</p>
<p class="null-p">-Because it's you, I fell in love and followed after you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet, please take my hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">The golden-haired, blue-eyed Auto-Memories Doll ‐ the most beautiful and distinguished person out of the people I had encountered ‐ Violet Evergarden ‐ smiled the slightest bits as she spoke,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gladly, Milady."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After the ball, we bathed together like always, dried each other's hair and combed them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet went back into the same look as when we first met, with her jacket, ribbon-tie one-piece, emerald brooch and cocoa-brown boots, departing from the academy after midnight.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, I would surely be faced with a bombarding of questions. About where the Lady Knight Princess had gone to.</p>
<p class="null-p">As we bid farewells, I made her just one request,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll pay for this someday; now I'm empty-handed so I can't give you anything, but I'll definitely return the favor. That's why, can I ask you something as a friend...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet Evergarden replied with her sweetly ringing voice,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Amy Bartlett. I do not accept money from friends."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that response, I became pained enough for my breathing to stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">I never saw her again after that. Only our letter exchange continued on forever.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">When the name of Isabella York was still Amy Bartlett, she had picked a little girl from a nearby prostitute district at almost the break of dawn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go steal something better next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">A boy wearing a hunting hat and bolero that hid his body up to his neck came out of a conversion store that also dealt with stolen goods. Upon a better look, it was obvious that he was actually a girl but her not fully developed body concealed her gender. For a woman to be dressing as a man if not as a hobby, the reason mostly had to do with protecting her own chastity.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such was that town.</p>
<p class="null-p">While clicking her tongue and spitting curses at the shopkeeper's greedy negotiations, Amy found a girl sitting on the ground as she exited the store.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Aah, this kid...</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than a girl, she was closer to being a baby. She was</p>
<p class="null-p">the daughter of a commercial comrade that Amy was close to. Nevertheless, both the child's parent and Amy were teenagers of the same age group.</p>
<p class="null-p">The whole town where Amy lived was a prostitution district located in a halfway point that interconnected big cities. The economic structure of the town based itself on entertaining travelers that would run out of supplies and migrating soldiers. The most common business in town after prostitution was burglary. There were also cases where prostitutes served as thieves.</p>
<p class="null-p">The stolen belongings were brought over to the conversion store, their owners would show up searching for them, and the shopkeeper would make a deal with them for double the original price. It was a vicious cycle of commerce where complicity happened between robbers and sellers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy would often see that child whenever she exited the conversion store. She had also gossiped with the latter's mother many times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where's your mom?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Amy asked so, the child pointed towards a spot not too far away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone had collapsed there.</p>
<p class="null-p">The way that the person's neck twisted was strange, and so Amy immediately knew that she had died.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Won't move."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, she's dead..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Had it been trouble because of jealousy, or had it been a random attacker? It was probably useless to tell anyone that a person had passed away.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would predictably be told that than living in such a town, where 90% of the crimes that occurred were let be, was worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">-But since we don't know any other place or other way of living, this is the only town where we can live.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy gazed down at the child who was not yet able to understand her own mother's death. She had fluffy and curly marigold-colored hair. Although she was wearing drapes, but her facial traits had a loveliness taken after her mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">If left her alone, she would likely be taken away and sold off by some pimp. Either that or she would get caught in the gears of theft business and become unable to break free from it. If one were to presume an even more horrid outcome, her entire body would be cut apart and end up in the hands of a dilettante.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your mom bought bread for me once."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past, Amy had been forced to make the same choice. To her, that child almost looked like herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hadn't managed to steal any wallets at all and hadn't eaten anything for who knows how many days, so she was a big help."</p>
<p class="null-p">The truth was that she had never received any bread from her, and was merely telling a lie in order to use it as reason. "That's why I'll help bury her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy waltzed back into the conversion store, told its owner about the situation and borrowed the help of a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Acquaintances of the child's mother were present as well, but no one proposed to report to the military police.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After an examination, she was buried safely in a nearby military cemetery. Upon finishing the burial, everyone seemed heavy-eyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do we do about that thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversion store's shopkeeper treated the child who did not attempt to move away from her mother's grave as an object.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cut her in pieces or sell her? If you leave it to me, I'll give you a portion."</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment, Amy's hands grabbed ahold of the fate of that child who to her was no different from a baby.</p>
<p class="null-p">-When it was me, this man decided to make me into a thief.</p>
<p class="null-p">To Amy, an everyday where she had to live as a robber was the worst, but perhaps she had to be thankful that she was not pickled in formalin. No, was she actually supposed to resent him? He had forced her into a path to live in such a world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll make her my little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why Amy thought about bestowing the child with another choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll make her my sister. No cutting her in pieces or selling her."</p>
<p class="null-p">No one would use her, nor would she use anyone. She would be granted a choice to be loved as just a child, who might have existed even if she had not been born in that place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amy. She ain't your kid, right? What kinda sense of duty are you doing that for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy answered the conversion store's owner while laughing,</p>
<p class="null-p">"For revenge."</p>
<p class="null-p">For herself, the child and the mother, Amy believed she wanted to take revenge upon the world and destiny that were subjecting them to such circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy had been angry ever since being born. And when her mother was murdered by a hoodlum. And when she was coerced by a man into stealing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even now as she stood in the middle of a cemetery covered in morning fog, Amy was all the while angry. What was that world even, she wondered.</p>
<p class="null-p">-What did I or they do? Why is the world so unfair?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was absurd, violent and cruel enough to make her nauseated. Every day, either her body or her heart would ache. There was not a single day without pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Whoever created the world, whoever gave minds to humans and dropped them down to earth is insane.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy cursed the perverted bastards that so liked to see people suffering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll make this kid happy. She was actually supposed to have been unlucky. I'll change that. It'll serve right the horrible people who were supposed to earn money out of her and the God that had been dictating her fate. Just you watch... I'll definitely, definitely show her a proper lifestyle."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy Bartlett had become Isabella York one year after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Amy had come to learn about loving someone, a messenger of someone who claimed to be her father paid her a visit. According to the messenger, he even now wanted the child of a lover that he had settled with over money in the distant past.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heirs had perished one after another from an epidemic. He would get her out of that poverty. Therefore, she should present herself to him. Although the messenger spoke in a delicate manner, in the end, he had come to say such a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Destiny made effective use of irrationality. The world only ever used Amy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy asked about her little sister. What would happen to the latter if she went over to the York house?</p>
<p class="null-p">The messenger looked at Amy's sister, who she had held in her arms and not let go of ever since he had appeared, and smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">They could never see each other again. A person from that household was not allowed to be involved with the daughter of a prostitute. If she did everything as told, they could send her sister to an orphanage or to a family that wanted children as an adopted one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That would also be better for her. Will you let her live like this?" he asked while laughing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let her live like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being questioned, Amy looked around her apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even for someone living on their own, the rooms were of a narrow plan. She had no idea how many years of construction the place had. Both the floor and roof were inclined, and if a storm came, the people who lived there would be blown away. There was a pan with leftovers of a soup that she had made two days before in the kitchen. It was the only thing they would have as meal for that day, too. One of the sides of the room's curtains was missing. On the floor lay a doll that she had bought for her sister. There were two picture books. Both had been handouts from someone else. Those were the only child toys they owned. Due to a routine without daytime or nighttime, their laundry seemed about to overflow from its basket.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a messy apartment. There was nothing clean.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet it was the most that Amy could currently manage. There was nothing else she could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much she triturated her body and worked, God would not give her anything. They did not exist. At the very least, They had never appeared to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no hope in her life. No passion. No kindness, either. There was not a single thing that shone in such a world of thin pitch-darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">If there was but one wonderful thing in it...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">From within Amy's arms, the most precious of the elements that composed her ‐ her little sister ‐ mustered out a tearful voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bi-g Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps having felt her guardian's distress with her entire body, she had started making a crying face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was not yet able to say Amy's name correctly, so she had been taught an abbreviation for "big sister" as a provisional pet name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amy had wanted to do many things for the child once she grew up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted her to attend school, make friends and experience many enjoyable moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their relationship had started out of revenge, but that was not the case now. She had managed to find hope for living in her dissatisfaction-ridden, awful life. Saving a small living being who would not be protected by anyon but herself, that is.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such was Amy's sole wonderful something. It had become the reason why she was currently fighting to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come now, there is only one answer you can give, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man extending a hand to her in the thin pitchdarkness was turning out as not an angel but a demon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alarm bells resounded in her head, telling her that those who moved forward beyond that point had to throw hope away entirely.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could not afford to separate from the value of her life, which she had finally found.</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not want to do it. She wanted to flee.</p>
<p class="null-p">-But...</p>
<p class="null-p">As the man had said, there was only one answer that she could give.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Along a highway of thriving greenery, there was an</p>
<p class="null-p">orphanage established through the reformation of a building that used to be a church.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the vicinities of the national institution, which Drossel was contributing to, there were fields and pastures that served as sustenance for the inquilines.</p>
<p class="null-p">The children that had been taken in were doing farm work while occasionally messing around with each other. As the staff watching over them admonished with, "Do it seriously", they could hear the vehicle noises of a motorcycle, which could not be well discerned due to being far away from where they were. It was running nimbly through the road of unpaved soil.</p>
<p class="null-p">Said motorcycle that cut through a scene of cheerful routine stopped in front of the orphanage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as the staff fearfully went to inquire about the guest, a man was dismounting the motorcycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the mail."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was an odd postman who wore high-heel boots that seemed to make it difficult to walk in such a rural area. His way of speaking was rough, but he had given a proper greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">The postal items were letters, and the recipient was a girl that had just recently come to the orphanage. She was an infant who could not yet do farm labor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Albeit put off by the man, who asserted that he would deliver the mail in person and did not listen to anyone, the staff led him to the room where the girl was. As he entered said room, the girl was absent-mindedly observing colorful lights pouring from a stained glass that had remained intact from the times when the place was a church.</p>
<p class="null-p">The vivid lights that had transparently melted into the room illuminated it. Perhaps the room was a place for keeping play equipment owned by the children, for there were many bookshelves and toys arranged in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">A young woman dressed as a nun, who indeed seemed to like children, was watching over the other infants.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, you've got two letters addressed to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">The postman crouched down to meet the child's gaze and offered the letters.</p>
<p class="null-p">The child did not try to take them. It might be her first time receiving letters.</p>
<p class="null-p">She took out of her mouth the finger that she had been sucking and pointed to herself, "Taylor."</p>
<p class="null-p">A gleam that seemed like it would pull people in floated on her big eyes. She was apparently welcoming the strange element that had abruptly entered her life, the postman.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man's voice resounded with a naturally softened pitch,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep, they're for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyes narrowed and he smiled just a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For Taylor?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Two letters for Miss Taylor Bartlett. Can you read? I guess it's a stupid question to ask a brat that looks like a baby. Hey, you over there; can she read?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly talked to by the handsome postman as she stayed silent, the young nun had her face red. She then shook her head mutely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No helping it. Hey, Taylor, I'll read them for you. Is that okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Taylor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cool, so it's okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big Bro."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who's 'Big Bro'? I have 'Benedict Blue' as my awesome name... No, listen. These two envelopes have each come from a different sender. One is from Violet Evergarden. She's my colleague. It says there that you can visit her if you have any troubles or any favors to ask in the future. She even courteously included a map to CH Postal Service... It means that you can come over if you have problems in getting a job."</p>
<p class="null-p">The postman, Benedict, pushed the letter onto Taylor after having finished reading it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Next: sender unknown. Written in it is... What? So short..."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no other text even as he tried turning over the stationary, so Benedict read it as it was,</p>
<p class="null-p">"'This is a magic word that will protect you ‐ "Amy". You just have to recite it'... is what it says."</p>
<p class="null-p">Taylor reacted with a start to that word. Her eyes opened wide, blinking several times.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just for the sake of putting it out there, Benedict bent his neck towards the nun and threw a complaint,</p>
<p class="null-p">"You should teach this kid how to read."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe it's because of the environment she was raised in, but her absorption of knowledge falls behind in comparison to the other children. We have to take care of the other children as well, so we don't have time to teach her with constant supervision..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it, but..." Benedict began, "it's gonna be necessary for when she grows up, ain't it? More importantly, she can't read letters... even though I went through the trouble of delivering them. People write letters because they want them to be read, right? And there're two. Two fellows who sent her letters. It's okay if it takes time; just teach her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike Auto-Memories Dolls, the postmen's job was delivery. Regardless, even for them, the desire of properly sending the feelings that someone had entrusted them with was the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">Auto-Memories Dolls got to see the faces of their clients, but they mostly did not see the faces of the people to whom said clients sent letters. The ones who witnessed the moment that someone's delivery arrived were they.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indifferent to the exchange between Benedict and the nun, Taylor was attempting to pronounce the word that she had been told,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh... Big Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">She did try to do so, but what came out were different words. That was the nickname of the grown-up who had been together with her for a single year in her life, which had only just started.</p>
<p class="null-p">A new bed, many strangers that she had never seen before. Within that fresh everyday, her memories of that person were fading away. Taylor no longer recalled even her own mother's face. Surely her recollections of the person called"Big Sis" would be thrown into a furnace of oblivion eventually. "Big Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, now was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could remember the doll that that person had given her and the flavor of her soup.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big Sis, Big Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">She could remember the warmth from the times of being embraced by her, as well as her hair that used to smell sugary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Big Sis."</p>
<p class="null-p">She could remember fact that that person used to be a significant existence to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">As tears surfaced in her eyes, she was able to recall vestiges.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Amy."</p>
<p class="null-p">To Taylor Bartlett, before she had realized, that word had become a magic spell for mustering courage.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl stared up at a red brick building that had a weathercock on its top.</p>
<p class="null-p">While the girl stood by the roadside, people incessantly entered and exited that postal company of slightly oldfashioned exterior. A young man carrying a package. A young woman holding a letter to a beloved someone under her arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">The windows seemed already open.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within the site, a postman mounted his motorcycle while yawning. A bewitchingly beautiful woman came after him in trots. Clicking his tongue at her as she forcefully took over the passenger seat, the youth made a face that did not seem at all dissatisfied from an angle she could not see.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lively laughter could be heard from the balcony of the third floor. So could the voice of a young woman that was angry for whatever reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, a man made his way to the balcony with a teacup in hand. He spotted the girl, who was nothing but a part of the cityscape, and candidly wave at her despite it being their first meeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, a young woman of lustrous blond hair revealed herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a place noisier and more valuable than what she had imagined. For the girl, that place was a dreamy one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Firmly grasping the white dress she was clad in, she stepped forward. And, at the same time, she recited the magic spell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amy."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">My most beloved Taylor,</p>
<p class="null-p">This is a letter I cannot send.</p>
<p class="null-p">From now on, I don't have any sort of relationship with you. This is the agreement I have made.</p>
<p class="null-p">Taylor, you see, the truth is that maybe I didn't want to become a big sister, but a mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">I love you, so I made this decision on my own accord. I wonder how that will affect your life. I won't stop wishing for it to go in a good direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">You'll forget about me for sure. I wonder if you'll grow up thinking you don't have a family.</p>
<p class="null-p">But y'know, Taylor, even if I'm not around anymore, and even if I get buried away within your memories, you'll call for me. Just that is enough. Our bond is eternal.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that I used to like your hair, the color of your eyes and your smile, and the fact that I believed I wanted to make you happy ‐ all of it will become eternal. Since "Amy" is a name I can't be addressed as anymore, since I loved you and since that time was an eternity to me, there will be continuation to it whenever you recite something as if it were magic. There will be continuation to the me that you're fond of.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, my Taylor, call my name if you get lonely.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 03: Benedict Blue</p>
<p class="null-p">We'd held hands in the darkness. The only proof that we were alive had been our body temperature.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever she'd say that she was scared, I'd reply with, "It's all right.". "Your Big Bro will do something about this." I'd tell her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who'd affirmed my existence was my little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'd managed to get courage from the fact that I could be relied on. That, yeah, I was an older brother. That she was no good without me, so I had to keep on living.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I didn't remember. I didn't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Had someone broken me? Had I broken on my own? I didn't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, she definitely existed. If I met her someday, I'd know it was her for sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if I had forgotten, even if I couldn't remember her, I'd recognize her if I saw her. I wished the same to be valid for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That feeling alone stayed inside me like a bonfire.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether the continents scattered around the world were big or small made no particular difference for the people living in them. Any place was the same should there be humans living in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">They would plow and grow. Harvest, build and color.</p>
<p class="null-p">Create and fail. Hide, interact, destroy, starve, succeed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Become depressed. Shed tears, coerce. Sparkle, act immoral. Repent, depart, worship. Acclaim, breed, mourn. Become idle. Become nostalgic. They would love each other and kill each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so would he.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Back when a certain continent put an end for once to a war that had extended for a long time, the "Continental War", battles continued happening in another continent as if it were natural. On the topic of occupations that had deep ties with so-called "wars", there were mercenaries.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although there existed different types of them, the mercenaries who wandered that continent were in majority freely warriors who would join any faction depending on the pay. They would head east today and west tomorrow. It did not matter if, for instance, a fellow mercenary with who they had drank together turned into an enemy. They would also not care for whatever happened to the head of the lord whose favor they had earned, or to the village of the woman they had slept with, depending on the money.</p>
<p class="null-p">And right now, too, a single mercenary was being led to the death that would certainly come to many others.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sandy blond hair swayed in the wind mixed with ashen dust. A man with looks that would be a waste should he perish in such a place lay collapsed the way he had been born.</p>
<p class="null-p">His ivory skin, in which golden hair stood on end, was exposed mercilessly to natural threats. The man groaned amidst his clouded memories, asking himself how on Earth things had turned out as such.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Three days ago, I was killing. Two days ago, also killing.</p>
<p class="null-p">He recalled several battles that he had surrendered his body to joining in a spur of the moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Yesterday... that's right, I was in the bar of a small highway town dancing with women, drinking...</p>
<p class="null-p">The man could more or less understand what had happened. He had extravagantly squandered to his heart's contentment the reward he received for surviving wartime fire and spent the night with an absurdly fine woman, who had taken notice of his lavish feasting.</p>
<p class="null-p">His lodging and the drinks he had consumed were arranged by said woman. She had most likely administrated some sort of drug into them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel sick... oeh..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that all of his belongings had been stripped off him, that the bounty he had earned at the cost of his life had been snatched away, and that he had been left to chance in such a place without anyone bothering to finish him off could not be called anything other than misfortune.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only that his body was not tied up was good luck, but even if it were, he would not have moved. It seemed he had by no means the energy to stand up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Some..." he attempted to say, but closed his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Even if I call for somebody, there ain't anyone around. Who even is "somebody" to me, anyway?</p>
<p class="null-p">The man did not have comrades or family to aid him in such a time.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what it meant to live as one pleased. He would make his baggage as light as possible and simply move forward to wherever he saw fit. If he had some sort of grandiose goal, it might lead him to good results.</p>
<p class="null-p">A lukewarm existence would sometimes turn into a hindrance for life decisions. Those who had nothing could probably see a world far broader than those who had everything. However, having no one to grieve for them when tasting such final moments was lonesome.</p>
<p class="null-p">A pain ran through somewhere in the depths of his chest ‐ the spot that was called "heart".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope, I ain't dying."</p>
<p class="null-p">The pain ran through, but the man did not have the spirit of someone who obediently perceived fate as fate. He balled his fists, exhorting his body and attempting to stand up somehow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As if I'd die... As if I'd die; as if I'd die!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because that roar had been the last of the strength he had left, from head down, the man collapsed onto his back once again after just yelling. Buried by sand, he lost consciousness. In his primary circumstances, he would have died there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, there was a certain number of individuals beloved by the Goddess of Fortune to the point of it twisting their destinies. The fact that a motorcycle was transiting the road-less way and that he met a passerby with a good heart who stopped upon finding him were all the work of the Goddess of Fortune.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The man opened his eyes again after few hours had gone by.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who... are you, seriously?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to the surprise, but also because he was sitting up, his voice was hoarse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Hodgins, a veteran in the middle of a trip. I'm the one you owe your life to for picking up your butt-naked self from the desert."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was a bit of a rich man, an easy-going one who could easily chime in with others, extremely calculating and intrigue-loving, who scored a large profit in war gambles and had an upstart. He was an entrepreneur currently in the middle of stablishing his business.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the man's first encounter with Hodgins, his lifesaver.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why'd you help me, Old Man?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">His harsh voice echoed throughout the interior of the shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two were in an open-terrace restaurant located at the first floor of an inn to which the man had been heading. It was too late for breakfast and too early for lunch.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man was conspicuous. After all, no matter how one looked at it, he was dressed in baggy, obviously borrowed shirt and trousers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I'm sorry. This kid is a bit ill-mannered. Yes, he'll quiet down... Hm? Wait a minute. 'Old man'...!? Me...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins opened his eyes wide and leaned closer to the man.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what he was going to react to?</p>
<p class="null-p">The youth and the overly cheerful man were a mismatched combination inside the refined inn. It was inevitable that the gazes of the customers would gather upon them in a natural manner, but at a growl of, "We ain't for display!" from the young man, everyone looked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Old Man, listen to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, more importantly, how about we clear up the issue of whether or not I look like an old man? I'm indeed past my twenties already, but I'm younger than the people from my generation who are married, my stomach doesn't stick out yet, and more than anything, I'm a fine man, right? Do I really seem like an old man? Not a big bro? How about you try thinking it over? Ready, set-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"OLD. MAN!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if stabbed in the heart by his words, Hodgins clutched his chest and moaned. "What is it... young man...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even his voice was pained.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why'd you help me? You're even treating me to food...</p>
<p class="null-p">What'cha after? I'm telling you I've got no money."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true. If the man were billed for a meal in that place now, it would be the end of the line for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">In contraposition, Hodgins waved his hand to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nah, I'm not after anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then you want my body?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've... got too much confidence in yourself. Well, when I first saw you, your body was buried in sand and I couldn't properly see anything other than your face... so, I thought you were a naked pretty girl who had passed out."</p>
<p class="null-p">After glancing fleetingly at the man, he turned his head to a different direction, eyes far-off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I lifted you in my arms, I noticed you had something extra there... but you were still alive, so I brought you back to the inn with me, stroked your body since you were with hypothermia... and when I realized, it was morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew you had no money just by looking. You had nothing with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, the one with an aching chest was the man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My bad. For... not having anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">As his voice tone changed quite a bit, perhaps what had been rubbed was a very sore spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Young man, why were you asleep in that place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Why,' you ask...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Albeit hesitating to discuss his misfortune, he talked about his situation in a summarized way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins had listened seriously at the beginning, but from the middle onward, he turned his face to the side and his shoulders trembled as if he were holding back laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you wanna laugh, just do it...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, can I? Ahah! Ahahahah! You'd finally earned some and lost all of it?! That's too pitiful! My stomach hurts... Ah, hold o-hold o-wait up. How about you stop lifting that chair? Let's calm down? It was terrible, wasn't it? You're hungry too, right? Eat up, eat up. Speaking of which, I didn't ask your name either. Young man, what's your name?" Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hey, no matter how badly behaved you are, you should at least give your name."</p>
<p class="null-p">Pouting, the man muttered curtly, "Ain't got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeming to have been made from the colors of the summer sky and blown into a glass ball, his remarkable eyes clouded over, and he defiantly spoke one more time. Crossing his arms, he rested his feet on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I ain't got a name. I might've been given one, but I don't have any. Call me whatever you want. My registration name from when I used to be a mercenary was 'Blue'. Since I dunno my name... I went with my eye color."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins showed agitation for the first time in front of the man, who had turned into a lump of displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Don't have any'... What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amnesia. My memory's got nothing but what happened starting from a few years back. I dunno where I was, what I was doing, where I'm from or who I was before this. When I came to, I was lying on a riverbank at the borders of this continent. Back then, I was wearing an armor and a cape... If I hadn't been picked by a woman gypsy, I'd have died just like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins at last realized his own words to have been a verbal gaffe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't remember anything? Not a single thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there something you do?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That might have been important to the man enough to make him falter even at putting it into words. After showing an expression of hesitation, he finally opened his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I probably... had a... little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">His attitude was almost that of confessing a sin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still, I don't remember her. I just have the memory that she existed, and I dunno what kinda person she was. But she was definitely there. I remember that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins wound up gripping his own shirt at the chest area.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tagged along with the gypsies for a while, learning from them how to sing, dance and stuff. Then, in the end, I changed jobs to mercenary. Looked like fighting fit my nature better, y'see. 'Battle-Hungry Freak' is my nickname. I'm famous in the mercenary world."</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon saying so, the man shrugged. "Well, that ain't a name, though..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not know who he was. Just how worrisome was that for him? The man did not seem to have a commendable personality at all, yet he was apparently concerned about not having a name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hu~n... that so? So, you... were a mercenary, yeah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Is it bad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not saying that it's bad per se. But even so, you got no money, no name or anything at all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No", "no", "no". The man's rage towards his own life was present at the many sorts of "no".</p>
<p class="null-p">"You wanna get killed, Old Man? Just saying it, but I don't have any sense of moral obligation, so if I don't like someone,</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm fine with beating them up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep, you're like that. Not a single 'thank you'. But I... don't hate insincere guys like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, you see, I have an acquaintance... it's a girl who resembles you... Even though I'm her legal guardian, I left her with other people and went on a journey as if running away. I sort of got the feeling I couldn't leave her by herself."</p>
<p class="null-p">--Someone who resembles me?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was there any such person in the world?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kinda fella is she?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not answering the man's question, Hodgins gave breadcrumbs to a dove that lay in waiting at his feet for his meal's leftovers to fall down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever he was thinking, he stayed quiet for a while and suddenly rose from his seat, chasing after the dove. The other doves could not stand his imposing action, batting their wings and fleeing into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what kinda fella is she!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His angry shout overlapped with Hodgins's innocent laughter and the sound of bird feathers.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the town that the doves had flown toward at his back, Hodgins turned around. His eyes seemed to be looking at the man, but were not.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The strongest and weakest in the world."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, Hodgins was smiling, but his eyes did not form an arc.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless of whether the person he referred to was evil or good, the air around him transmitted the fact that she was someone important.</p>
<p class="null-p">The man frowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">--What's that...? A riddle...?</p>
<p class="null-p">He became even less able to understand the lifesaver in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also have to just go and face her already."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins had said he was in his thirties, but he seemed older than that as he talked about the "strongest and weakest in the world.".</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't tell her... that it's hard for me to look at her face when she seems sad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Eyes crinkling, the man thought:</p>
<p class="null-p">--This dude... he pretends to be decent but something's up with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He sensed a twist from the laughing other man. The latter spoke a lot at first, but he had seemed to be giving vent to his thoughts rather than having a conversation. Was he not burdened with some sort of enormous problem? One that he truly could do nothing about, no less.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's settled."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins pointed an index finger at the man and snapped one of his eyelids closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you aren't anything, won't you tag along with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Meaning... you're gonna hire me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. You lack too much of everything. Come to my place earn money. You need cash to search for your sister and to get revenge from the guys that threw you naked into the desert, don't you? In exchange, can you lend me your life for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right now, you only have your life, yeah? I'll buy that."</p>
<p class="null-p">At those words, the man's heart started making astir sounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was supposedly used to having his life bought with money, but when asked for it face-to-face, his breathing felt as if it would stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How much is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being asked so, the man was at loss for an answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">* *</p>
<p class="null-p">Afterward, the man acquired a name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict Blue."</p>
<p class="null-p">He also secured a profession and a place to sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">The CH Postal Company.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had a lifesaver who was dear to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Claudia Hodgins.</p>
<p class="null-p">He obtained comrades as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had treaded a long prologue, but that was his story.</p>
<p class="null-p">* *</p>
<p class="null-p">"The rough explanation ends here. The client who made this request just wants the letter sent definitively. Little Violet will do the ghostwriting. Benedict will do the delivery. It's a sudden commission, but it's good that you two were going to work in the same place. I can also count with Benedict for seeing off and meeting on return with Little Violet. I'll give you a few days' break when you're done, so do your best.</p>
<p class="null-p">How's that? Does it seem okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict observed the golden-haired girl who immediately answered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes" with blue eyes similar to hers. They sat next to each other on a sofa in Hodgins's room. It was a languid early morning. Work was about to begin that day as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">The climate, atmosphere and food of Leidenschaftlich, which Benedict was once not used to due to having come from a different continent, now penetrated his body without any sense of displacement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no reason and was not in the position to refuse. The one in front of him was his lifesaver and superior. He did not show respect for the latter, but felt familiarity from him. Most likely, of the highest degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"V, don't make your luggage too heavy. It'll weaken my beloved bike's movements."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl beside the amnesiac Benedict was an individual who had only just appeared into his short life. From the time they had first met, to Benedict, she had rooted herself in the classification of people whom he "somehow could not leave on their own".</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a stunning Auto-Memories Doll. Her impudence aside, she was an ignorant child unknowing of the ways of society. In the beginning, he had doubted that such a machine-like person come from the military would manage working in the service business, but she was currently the most popular figure of the CH Postal Company.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is true. I shall reduce the firearms to the minimum equipment. My body weight is also heavy due to the prosthetics, so it will increase the burden on Benedict's motorcycle."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her fine appearance had always stolen the eyes of whoever looked at her, but lately, he had the feeling that her charm had increased. It was as if spring had been born from within her cold beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if the equipment is scarce, if I am with Benedict, I will probably not struggle in case of emergencies."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had become able to smile faintly on occasion.</p>
<p class="null-p">The biggest incident amongst the ones that they had just recently experienced in person ‐ the Intercontinental Train's hijacking ‐ crossed Benedict's mind. And so did a man with an eyepatch, who had showed up embracing Violet sideways as she had lost an arm, and taken his leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had not heard everything about the past of the two, but Hodgins had told him the general story afterward. They were in love with each other. There was no room for anyone to come in-between. Their colleague, Cattleya, had said that the two apparently started seeing each other on off days. "I'm glad." Cattleya had laughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict did not deem it as good. That was probably the reason why looking at Violet felt somewhat unamusing as of late. He suspected that she was being deceived by a much older man who had conveniently vanished and come about once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting it positively, he was worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict tautly flicked Violet, who had no idea about his feelings, on the forehead with his fingertips,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really; you're light. It's just that your bag's heavy. Old Man, you ever lifted V's luggage? Swing that thing around and it's like a normal blunt weapon; a blunt weapon. There's a ton of weapons in it under her clothes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins made an all but deplorable face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Little Violet... you buy guns with your salary, right...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"They were distributed to us back when we were in the military, but now I have no option except purchase them myself. I can only take Witchcraft when President Hodgins grants me permission, after all. I have recently purchased a long-range shotgun. My hands are actually more accustomed to wide-swing maces, however..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps due to having a desire to acquire large weaponry, Violet moved as though wielding the real thing, staring fixedly at the imaginary weapon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do, no can do. I've gone through the trouble of getting you a cute look, so don't take stuff like that with you aside from emergency cases."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop, stop. Giving you a ride would get even heavier."</p>
<p class="null-p">Completely shut down by the two men, Violet put on a disappointed expression, as if disheartened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am prepared to explain the advantage points of the mace, though..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without her having the opportunity to give said explanation, the two were set to depart in haste. Seen off by Hodgins and after Lux, who was on phone duty, waved at them, Benedict and Violet left the agency.</p>
<p class="null-p">The blond duo swayed on the motorcycle towards wherever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Autumn had ended, the seasons changing into winter. Leidenschaftlich usually did not witness snowfall, yet icy winds were blowing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gloves, scarves, hooded coats ‐ even if the protection measures against low temperatures were appropriate, cold was cold. As the one driving, Benedict had no choice but simply endure the chilly gusts head-on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's artificial arms around his torso were gelid as well. The heat from the part of her actual body that was in contact with his back was the only warmth. He could feel the hold of her arms more firmly than when giving her rides back in summer. Was it because of the coolness or because of her trust in him?</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling an itch, Benedict sneezed, "Achoo!" While vigorously speeding up the motorcycle over the vast land, he initiated a conversation for no particular reason, "It's cold!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"V, your prosthetics okay? Ain't there any downsides or something if they get too chilled?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is bad if the joints freeze, but that will not happen as long as the coldness is not extreme."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hu~n."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We mostly roamed around northern lands during the</p>
<p class="null-p">Continental War, so I am knowledgeable of the protections against cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the place we're going to ‐ Lontano ‐ is inside Leidenschaftlich, so for starters, it won't be snowing there this time of the year. As long as the weather isn't abnormal, that is.</p>
<p class="null-p">There'll also be no obstacles to my delivery duties."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. This is reassuring."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't say that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why not? The climate is stable. The one who said that there would be no obstacles to the delivery duties was you,</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it; it's 'cause you're with me. When you say stuff of the sort, it feels like something will happen instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So the weather will become abnormal because of what I said?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict knew that Violet's eyebrows were furrowing even without looking at her. He laughed aloud.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stu~pid. You've got it wrong. I'm saying that 'cause it's easy for some kinda problem to happen when I'm with you. To make up for your luggage being lighter, we got ready to manage at least an interception if anything in general goes down, but... Lontano is a pretty big city, so there's lots of thugs. Flashy towns also got many dark sides."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What an issue..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You got picked by some weirdo and it was fight on; you were attacked by a bandit and it was fight on; the motorcycle broke and we got stuck in some field. Also, what else...? You raise one small thing and there's no end to it."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to protest, Violet alleged,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I cannot agree with this. Benedict, the fights that you started one-sidedly are also included."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so? Might be bad for me to get teamed up with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short pause, Violet objected again ‐ to the part about teaming up with Benedict being a "bad" thing,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I cannot agree with this either... Indeed, I can assume there is a factor in us that makes it easy to bring about some sort of conflict. However, we were able to deal with them. We, the two of us... can deal with it if something happens again."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was difficult to tell what she was thinking, and she might well have been merely protesting against the negative reputation of her own abilities. Still, Benedict somehow heard it as something other than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heheh." laughter leaked from him in a natural manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her breath coming out in white puffs behind him, Violet added as if just recalling it,</p>
<p class="null-p">"This applies to times of war and not to times of peace, but... we would have even less enemies if Cattleya were included," she whispered intermittently and Benedict smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that happened, there'd really be no match for us." he chuckled.</p>
<p class="null-p">From that point onward, the way to their destination took a couple of hours.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place that the Auto-Memories Doll and postman from CH Postal Company headed to was Lontano.</p>
<p class="null-p">Small in comparison with the capital Leiden, it was the most prosperous city amongst the neighboring ones. The houses formed circles as if to surround an old castle sitting on top of a slightly elevated hill that extended itself for about a hundred meters, a river with the same name as the country flowing nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">Enshrined within a solemn atmosphere, said old castle was a famous attraction of the city. While holding the rights to it themselves, the clan that formerly owned it had handed its management over to the city, and the city allowed people to tour inside of it for cheap admission fees. The old castle had become a grandiose touristic spot, for the one who had built it was a well-known architect.</p>
<p class="null-p">Places with renowned attractions that had cultural value were easy to turn into the aspired cities of young artists. Not an exception to this, Lontano had art and history museums, theatre venues and a market of ancient books, making the urban area into one where lovers of such things would be unable to help themselves just from strolling through it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before entering the city gates, one could overhear music as young people played instruments by the road, and walking a little into the city, one would find bookstore after bookstore. The vicinities of statues and fountains were packed with people drawing sketches. It was city of gorgeous structure, yet gloomy and easy to get lost in if one wandered into an alley.</p>
<p class="null-p">Albeit a small ward, there was also a red-light district, which was more popular amongst those who had no interest in arts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict dropped Violet off at the city's entrance. She would then rush over to the customer who lived in that city and ghostwrite for them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict himself had several packages to deliver around the city. Once the work there ended, they would return to Leiden, where the submission of reports and delivery of more letters would be waiting for them.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why Hodgins had ordered the two of them to go to that city. It was more efficient than going through the trouble of having Violet use public transportation, as it there was no fare and took less time.</p>
<p class="null-p">The current time was right before noon, the tourists gradually forming a lively crowd.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where. Should. It. Be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict's sky-blue eyes traveled about in search for a good meeting spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a bank, a bakery, a souvenir store, and a statue of a naked woman carrying a child. The bakery also seemed to have a café, and people could be seen enjoying the apparently warm interior and freshly baked bread from the glass windows.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's settled. V, let's make the bakery our meeting spot. No matter who arrives first, we wait inside."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet nodded curtly, "You want to eat bread, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do. That bakery's bread is tasty. I never went inside to eat it, though. But it's delicious enough that making sure to buy something there and bring it over if we have deliveries to do in Lontano is almost common sense among fellow postmen. That one with melted cheese on it... let's make it a souvenir for Old Man."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Benedict talk about purchasing a souvenir, Violet blinked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I comply. But Benedict, did something happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her reaction all but asked if he had gone crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're being the rudest possible to me with that, y'know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I apologize... Well, did anything happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict's act of buying souvenirs for Hodgins purely out of goodwill seemed unbelievable for Violet. Therefore, she uttered her concern for a malfunction in either his body or mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict struck the top of her head with a light knife-hand in an expression of sympathy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing's up! You just don't know it, but I sometimes give the Old Man souvenirs! Even Auto-Memories Dolls buy souvenirs to the agency if they go to some exotic place, right? It's the same as that. The Old Man treats me to food and stuff before payday too... Like lunch, well, pretty often..." "President Hodgins tends to give Benedict a special treatment."</p>
<p class="null-p">--Don't wanna hear that from you who he treats like a daughter, Benedict thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">He spoke while turning to the other side,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welp, he went as far as taking in an amnesiac like me and giving me a name... He might be special to me, and I to him."</p>
<p class="null-p">He accidentally, unintentionally voiced it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet threw in an interjection quite like normal and Benedict was taken aback.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not as if he were hiding the fact he had amnesia or that the name "Benedict" had been given to him by Hodgins, but he had never talked about it to his work colleagues. That was because he had until now no trials of explaining he had amnesia in which he had received a decent response.</p>
<p class="null-p">He would either earn uncalled-for looks or have condolence-like words of pity spat at him. Whichever it was, Benedict was the kind of person who would end up irritated at the other party.</p>
<p class="null-p">He already had a name and social position. No longer was he the "Blue" who had nothing. He did not want to feel ashamed of back when he had lived by his eye color's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I wonder...</p>
<p class="null-p">He was not proud of it either.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I wonder how she'll react.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would certainly not make a big scandal, but would probably say something annoyingly depressing. While embracing uncomfortable feelings, Benedict waited for her response.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, no matter how long he waited, there was no reaction after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their blue eyes repeatedly exchanged stares. A prolonged silence ensued between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, Violet tilted her head slightly as if to ask,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict wound up delving into it without thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, anything to say on me having amnesia?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's golden eyelashes batted. "'Anything'...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is, right? It's amnesia we're talking about. That's rare, ain't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying it himself was somewhat embarrassing and pathetic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did that mean she was not too interested in his past? He felt a little let-down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is not true."</p>
<p class="null-p">The next words he heard changed his feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is indeed uncommon, but in my personal subjectivity, this is not odd."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet susurrated with a tone that sounded somehow happy,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also do not have any memories from before a certain point in time. I did not know how to speak, either. Major bestowed me with the name of a flower goddess. Benedict, what meaning was yours given with?"</p>
<p class="null-p">--That's right.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that Benedict having amnesia was not a big issue for Violet.</p>
<p class="null-p">--That was it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl so-called Violet Evergarden also used to be not even a person, but a weapon, during the time she had no name. And she spoke of it without any pretension. She did not think of it as a shame.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is President Hodgins who we are talking about, so he must have given it with some sort of meaning. The two of us can be said to be very fortunate, right? If I had been used by anyone other than Major, I do not know what would be of me as of now."</p>
<p class="null-p">If anything, she thought of it as merely a process for until meeting the person she loved most.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet, who was innocent and indeed lacked something somewhere, felt sorrowful and precious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what is the meaning of your name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I forgot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's ask President Hodgins when we return. I want to know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, no! Don't ask! Well, I'll go do the deliveries, so you go to your client too! See ya later!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict mounted the motorcycle once again and waved a hand at Violet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. I shall leave the name matter for later as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're stubborn."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the two headed to work, each on a different direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict's deliveries did not take too long. One house received a package with an assortment of supplies from a mother living in Leiden to her son working in Lontano. Three buildings received documents exchanged between offices. Five residences received letters.</p>
<p class="null-p">In case of absences, he would have a little bit of work either taking the delivery back with him or asking the person's neighbors about where they had gone to, yet he finished earlier than he had presumed without the need for such things.</p>
<p class="null-p">He soon entered the meeting-spot bakery, taking a seat from where he could see the situation outside through the glass and drinking coffee. It seemed Violet's ghostwriting job would still take some time.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Guess I'll pick the souvenir first, then.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was not able to imagine Violet enjoyably choosing a gift, so picking one by himself was probably more efficient. Thinking so, Benedict selected a few items that he had deemed savory from his own experience eating them. As per a request to the clerk, he had Hodgins's part of the bread wrapped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sensing the plainness in color of the goods that he had chosen, Benedict tilted his neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn~, anything else you recommend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about a pie or tart? Also, these aren't bread, but I recommend our cookies as well. There are people who come here just to buy them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah~..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're popular among girls. The ribbons are cute, too." One woman surfaced in Benedict's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've got someone who'd like them, but she's far away now. All right. Just add this pie."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, he had an apple pie as addition. He then</p>
<p class="null-p">returned to his seat and calmly savored the coffee.</p>
<p class="null-p">While observing the packet in which he had requested it to be wrapped, he faintly wondered if the person on the receiving end would be pleased with it. He was soon able to imagine Hodgins smiling broadly and taking into his hands the souvenir offered by his brusque self. He could picture the other being a little surprised, and then slowly breaking into a smile after being told what it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the other saying, "Thanks, Benedict.", and himself turning to the side while replying, "It's nothing.". He would have also been glad to take money out of his deserted wallet for the cookies if there were anybody to receive them, yet...</p>
<p class="null-p">--She's hella far away right now, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who came to his mind was a girl of dark hair and purple eyes, Cattleya Baudelaire. Much like Benedict, she has been a colleague from since CH Postal Company's foundation day.</p>
<p class="null-p">She liked sweets, was bad at dealing with hardships, was a scaredy-cat despite looking daring and fearless, and had a childish side as opposed to her appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Well, guess she wouldn't be too happy if she got them from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">They would quarrel as soon as they saw each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Enough to turn it into a common occurrence within the CH Postal Company. It was easy to tell just by looking that they did not actually do it due to truly detesting one another, however...</p>
<p class="null-p">--I wonder if she hates me.</p>
<p class="null-p">...they could not tell it so easily themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they were in the same agency, they had different occupations, therefore missed each other often. Theirs was a repetition in which dawn would break after the previous time they had fought, and they would forget that the fight had happened and start another fight yet again. Regardless, they would end up talking to one another on sight, unable to ignore each other, and so he thought of pleasing her with something.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I don't hate her, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">For Benedict, the sense of distance between himself and she, who was worthy of being considered a new breed of human being, was something complicated.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Things just kinda don't go well with us. I can't treat her like other women.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he had never experienced a proper romance, he had no way of knowing what that meant.</p>
<p class="null-p">After he reflected on all sorts of things, a big yawn left his mouth. He stretched both arms towards the sky with a jerk and arched his body like a cat. And then relaxed once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking of taking a break from work had all of his strained feelings and body slackening up.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm getting kinda sleepy.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he had to work since early in the morning and his daily duties had overlapped, the sense of satisfaction from having a full stomach and the gently warm room caused his eyelids to naturally lower. His body was slowly, slowly stolen by drowsiness and he wound up unable to keep his eyes open.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scent of the shop's interior was fragrant, people's conversations sounding fun. The elements composing an atmosphere that could be understood from one's heart loosened Benedict's caution.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Even though... V's coming...</p>
<p class="null-p">A golden-haired girl surfaced in Benedict's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">--If it's her, well, guess she'll soon find me.</p>
<p class="null-p">The café inside the shop was crowded. Still, he believed that, since it was her, she would come to that place at full speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">--She'll... look for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">After he became amnesic, no matter whom he asked, there was no one who knew him.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It's okay if I nap, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">No one had looked for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It's okay, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Violet Evergarden probably would.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking so, Benedict closed his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">He yawned sudden and widely, falling asleep altogether as</p>
<p class="null-p">if he were dead. Consciousness distant, his line of thought floated into the air. He forgot what he was thinking about midway, invited into the realm of dreams.</p>
<p class="null-p">Calling them "dreams" might be a faulty form of expression. In his case, they were reproductions of memory fragments that he had ended up shutting down. Once released from the real world, the past would come chasing after him and softly tap on his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">A film that felt like an old friend returning from far away played in his mind. "Why, welcome back, my mate who no longer remembers his own name." it said.</p>
<p class="null-p">The film would repeat itself over and over inside Benedict's head. His reunion with his friend named past would begin with a night sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a beautiful nighttime, in which a full moon had appeared. His memory version crawled out of an extremely, extremely dark place, and so he was startled at the bright light of said moon for an instant and shuddered.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a sandy beach under his feet. Stomping onto it, his shoes were blemished with mud and bloodstains. The dull ache in his entire body was agonizing. He might have earned himself a serious injury. Nevertheless, his legs moved without him being able to mind the pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">His hand was holding onto something. Something smooth and small that had body temperature.</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked back. A little girl came into sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl had blond hair much like Benedict, but of a slightly different shade. Her hair was bundled up in a black velvet ribbon.</p>
<p class="null-p">As their eyes met, she nodded as if to say, "I'm fine.".</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming so, Benedict ran faster. He trusted the girl following him. Eventually, his gaze moved ahead. A single boat was fluctuating on the surface of the sea.</p>
<p class="null-p">--There, we can escape with that, he thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not know what they were fleeing from. However, if it was something frightening enough to scare him, whether it was someone horrifyingly strong or a large-numbers-againstsmall-numbers situation, their circumstances were that they had to run away. But that was not the issue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict turned around and said, "We're escaping on that thing, *****."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if having erased it, he was unable to hear her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">" ***** , you're coming too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He also could not hear his own name as spoken by the other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. I won't abandon you. We'll end up ----. 'Cause that's ----'s way of doing things. Without that drug, you ----."</p>
<p class="null-p">The color of her hair, eyes and lips ‐ he could see those splintered things.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But... But even if you ----, even I stop recognizing you</p>
<p class="null-p">as my little sister, even if you stop recognizing me as your big brother, it's fine. We're siblings, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">But he could not see her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if we forget, I'm sure we'll recognize each other on sight."</p>
<p class="null-p">He could not tell how her face looked. The hues of her ribbon and orbs were fragmented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that right? If we're together, even if we forget, we can remember each other as many times as we need. If you find a man that you like or something, you can forget and throw me away. But until then..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The shades of her hair, her voice and intonation ‐ he could only tell those kinds of things apart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...don't let go of this hand no matter what. If you do that, we'll really end up forgetting everything."</p>
<p class="null-p">The past Benedict said as if making a threat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand, *****."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two boarded the boat and started rowing toward the open sea.</p>
<p class="null-p">At last, things would always end at a point where he was looking up at the boat from the bottom of the ocean. And so, he would think that, aah, they had failed.</p>
<p class="null-p">His body convulsed with a start. The film reproduced inside his head did not go for more than a few minutes, yet Benedict awoke accompanied by a sense of fatigue, almost as if he had gone on a long journey.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Eyes half-open, he looked about the surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">He checked the shop's clock. Not even ten minutes had passed since he had begun drinking his coffee.</p>
<p class="null-p">Poising himself calmly, he took the only slightly cold coffee into his mouth. Upon drinking a mouthful of it, he became unable to settle with just a little and downed it in gulps as if it were water.</p>
<p class="null-p">"One more." he asked for another of the same thing, raising his hand to one of the shop's waiters.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had wanted the bitterness of reality, enough for him not to be invited by sleepiness anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">--You've seen this so many times, yet you're still scared of it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he had been thinking until just a moment before that she did not have to come, he now wished to see that blunt girl very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It's fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not even he knew what was fine exactly, but he told himself so.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It's fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">He needed those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm... fine. Ain't that right?</p>
<p class="null-p">He himself did not give an answer to the question asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict wound up sneering.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not use to be so agitated even back when he worked as a mercenary for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked around again. Nobody was a target of dread. Nothing was currently happening. It was not as if he were rushing through a battlefield in order to earn money either, nor had he been abandoned in a desert completely naked. He could tell as much even without sorting out the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was blessed now and nothing was terrifying. Things were finally peaceful. Too peaceful.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Benedict did not know that, the more peaceful times were, the more often would the pain of the scars marking him end up coming back.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Ever since he took me in, haven't I grown weak?</p>
<p class="null-p">Oddly enough, be it mental or physically, wounds were not curable. Their visible parts would heal. However, even if they healed on the surface, just by the atmosphere and the people and things involved when the injury happened overlapping with one another, the truth that "a wound was earned" would return.</p>
<p class="null-p">The figurative scars would chase after people forever like the Moon floating in the sky. And they would ache. Even if the injury took but an instant, the truth that one had been wounded was eternal.</p>
<p class="null-p">--When... will I get to remember everything?</p>
<p class="null-p">The scar from forgetting the one person that he absolutely should not have forgotten was causing Benedict's heart to self-mutilate without him realizing. If the replaying of his memories had already happened thousands of times, then for those thousands of times, Benedict had been attacking himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without knowing why he would become so flustered, he reproduced his recollections again. They were a repetition of the previous ones. As seen from the sidelines, things were obvious to those who knew of his circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">A new coffee was brought over, but he did not feel like drinking it in that warm place. It was Benedict who had come up with the arrangement, saying that one should wait for the other inside, yet he had decided to wait in front of the shop mounted on his motorcycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Breathing in amidst the coldness, he calmed down a little. The perfectly clean, icy air within his body cooled down his head. Even if his body shook, it was because of the chilliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Benedict looked straight to the side. It was due to him feeling a stare for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">A short-haired blonde girl was standing there. Hers was an unnatural shade of blond, so it was most likely a wig. She was dressed in a milky white satin dress similar to the tone of her skin under a black trench coat. She seemed like the kind of woman who led a life of having her praises sung by men in that city of artists.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a cigarette between her fingers, she blew tobacco smoke out of her bright red lips. Being in a bar surrounded by men all around and laughing elegantly would suit her. The front of a bakery was not fitting of her...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You-" the woman mustered out at Benedict, with an aspect that seemed to say she had done so unwittingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice was husky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict returned her gaze. The woman gave him an odd feeling of déjà vu. Had they not met somewhere before, his sixth sense whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Subconsciously, his eyes went to her hair. If that sister of his had grown up, was a woman with such appearance too old to be her? Still, women could change the age suggested by their looks however they wanted with make-up and clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict knew the morning-to-night faces of the women he had spent time with until now. Should he not discard the possibility that she was his younger sister?</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because the glint in Benedict's eyes had sharpened, the woman took a step backward, and then threw the cigarette away, leaving the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, she walked slowly, gradually going in small trots.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey." when he realized it, Benedict had hopped off his motorcycle and was calling out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">He pursued the woman as she ran, grabbing her arm by force.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not liking it, the woman attempted to shake free from him, but Benedict bound her arms behind her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she smelled of sickly sweet perfume, it felt as if he was about to suffocate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know me, right?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You definitely do, don't you?! No, I... I...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">--I feel like I know you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You... Are you..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He might have been jumping to conclusions. He was fine with it being a misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if that was not the case, then he certainly did not want to lose such information by mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you... my little... sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being asked so, the woman covered her mouth with her two hands.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The way back was extremely quiet on that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having finished the ghostwriting for her client, Violet called over to Benedict, who was exhaling white puffs outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">It took him a few seconds to react back, and his face looked almost as if he had seen a ghost. She noticed he had nothing in hands despite having said that he would buy Hodgins a souvenir, and as they went back into the shop, the clerk was looking after it.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Benedict said nothing, Violet was the one to thank her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as she told him, "Well, then, let us go home," while mounting on the backseat, he was out of it and did not take off.</p>
<p class="null-p">And even as the motorcycle finally moved, he stopped driving without as much as one minute passing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"V, my bad. I'm... feeling awful right now. I might cause an accident and get you hurt."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet did not ask if something had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he was certainly pale-faced, Violet changed seats with a,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I will do the driving.", adapting to the necessities of the moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had learned how to ride horses and vehicles to an extent during her soldier days. Even as it had been a while since then, she had confidence that she could do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict. You will fall like this, so please hold tighter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My bad..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, if you feel sick from the swaying, I will stop. Please say it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah. My head's kinda hurting a lot. Can I... close my eyes for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is all right."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying so, Violet looked up at the sky. As dusk approached, the sky was shrouded in clouds, but it did not seem as if rain, snow or abnormalities in the weather would occur.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was awfully rare of Benedict to candidly bask on people's goodwill and apologize. Since he was feeling unwell, it was impressive that he had not yet lost only his judgement of having her replace him as the driver.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the fact that Benedict, who normally had but a big attitude, stayed silent the whole trip, clung onto a girl younger than him and sat on the backseat would be considered a state of emergency by the staff of the CH Postal Company if they saw him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Violet Evergarden also understood that it was an emergency.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somewhat tired as he might be, drowsy as he might be, that man would never let someone else drive his beloved bike. It was a personal vehicle given to him by Claudia Hodgins when the latter was starting his business.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet merely spoke to him dispassionately, =</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, were you talking to anyone before I had</p>
<p class="null-p">arrived?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have good ears."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're like a wild animal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'I want to run away from here'. 'I want you to buy me time'. 'I want you to help me' ‐ things like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than being a poor talker, Violet was not as proficient at conversational skills as most people, and so she did not know the right way to speak to him at such a time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's got nothing to do with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict replied coldly in a low voice that sounded as if he were repelling her.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the talk ended there, a curtain of silence descended upon them once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet was deep in thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">She almost never put effort into conversations. If she was told not to speak, she would not speak. When asked a question, she would answer. She would inquire what was necessary. That was what conversations used to be about. For her, at least.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the grown-up Violet now understood things could not be that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">She spoke to Benedict again,</p>
<p class="null-p">"That lady called you her brother, Benedict, but you have amnesia, right? Is that person your younger sister? Rather... did you really have a younger sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where'd you hear that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was observing from nearby as you were binding that woman's arms behind her back. I learned from President Hodgins that no one should intervene on male-female relationships. Therefore, I stood in waiting on the spot and watched over you, so as to mediate if it were necessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the Old Man doing...? Speaking of that, this kinda thing's called 'eavesdropping'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was that person your younger sister? Your appearances when you were side by side did not strike me as..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The motorcycle passed over a rock while she was speaking, and so the vehicle's frame floated buoyantly for an instant. It landed roughly and started running once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She did not seem to be your younger sister to me. This is but my assumption, but I believe she is older than you are. To begin with, you have amnesia, so even if you did have a younger sister living separately from you, is there no need for further investigation since you do not remember her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet was much too indifferent. Without any compassion or curiosity regarding whatever was happening to Benedict, she levelly stated her conclusions. Even if should it rub Benedict's nerves the wrong way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! You don't know that! She might be the one!" Benedict hit Violet's back with his fists.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a little sister! I have memories of her! That's the only thing I'm definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely sure of!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How come? You don't have memories."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can tell!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When asked so, he had no choice but speak sentimentally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Cause I feel love for her!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet dry-swallowed curtly at the word "love".</p>
<p class="null-p">"It stayed in me! Even if I don't have my memories, I have this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was embarrassing and foolish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the only thing that's definitely, definitely not a lie!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He normally never spoke of love, yet he desperately resorted to it only for now.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I mean, we held hands in the darkness. The only proof that we were alive was our body temperature. Whenever she'd say that she was scared, I'd reply with, "It's all right". "Your Big Bro will do something about this," I'd tell her. The one who'd affirmed my existence was my little sister. I'd managed to get courage from the fact that I could be relied on. That, yeah, I was an older brother. That she was no good without me, so I had to keep on living.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still...</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had a sister, and I don't really get it, but I was protecting her! I was thinking about protecting her no matter what, no matter what...! I don't know why I'm living by myself like this...! Memory-I don't have memory!"</p>
<p class="null-p">--I don't remember.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Protect her from what...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">--I don't know. Did someone break me? Did I break on my own?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know! Could be anything... That's-That's not what's important to me! I don't care about how I used to live when I was a brat... I supposedly used to have a sister, and the fact she's not here is a problem for me! I'm amnesiac, and when I woke up, my sister wasn't by my side; I'd turned into an idiot who didn't know anything about myself or my sister! I have nothing! But...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">--I don't know. But...</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I definitely... have a little sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">--She definitely existed. If I meet her someday, I'll know it's her for sure. Even if I forgot, even if I can't remember her, I'll recognize her if I see her. I want the same to be valid for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that thought, all along, he had lived on as if praying. "That woman said she knows me... I've also-I've also seen her before somehow. I don't know whether she's my sister or not. But even if she isn't... when that time comes, I don't wanna have regrets!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying so, Benedict had his face slammed against Violet's back. That was because the motorcycle came to a sudden, abrupt stop. Benedict's nose, neither too high nor too low, was smashed, and he anguished for a brief moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet, the driver and the cause of his pain, turned backward and reached a hand out to Benedict. Their faces were close enough that her golden hair, burning against the madder red sky, brushed the tip of his nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet gripped Benedict's shoulder as if to tell him, "Don't run away.".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes ‐ her blue orbs ‐ pierced him like a blade.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please listen. I have told you before that I am also an orphan, was taken in and raised, and do not know who my parents are, right? From my experience, individuals who 'tend to presume on their memories' will come in contact with vagabonds attempting to do inexcusable things. Those who invited me into the dark by claiming to know me and proposing to discuss it in detail were neither one nor two people."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet Evergarden desperately trying to convey her own words to the other party was just as unusual as Benedict entrusting his beloved bike to someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During my days as a soldier, Major always bore the full brunt of it and protected me."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was precisely why, with her rapid-fire speech, Benedict could not seal her lips using stern persuasion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After growing up, I was almost murdered by a cultist organization that claimed I was not a human being but a demigod. I know nothing of my past, so even if I am told such things, I find myself thinking that they might be true. Benedict, are you not the same as me in this aspect? There are probably many women who know you. The women that you have dated, the people you have spent the night with until now ‐ do you recall every one of them? You and President Hodgins are similar. In the past, President Hodgins came to the hospital room where I was hospitalized in a state of having drunk his regrets away and talked torrentially. Have you never done something like this? Even if you leave out the likelihood of being deceived by that person... if you are still thinking about doing something..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's words were not gentle in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, within her own possibilities, she was thinking, thinking and thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, do you need back-up fire?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, she was attempting to do whatever she could to the maximum degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do not... know whether or not I am your friend. Lux seems all right with being my friend. Cattleya called me a friend too. Benedict, I do not know about you. We spend a large amount of time together, but even now, I still cannot say for sure what definition I should give to others. To me, the people who have told me that I am their friend are my friends as of late."</p>
<p class="null-p">What lay between the two of them was their time spent together. From the moment they had first met until now, they had built a relationship of trust.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is why, for me, even if you are not my friend, in case there is anything troubling you..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as the forgotten nurturing between Benedict and his sister, it was something precious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, regardless of what the definition of our relationship is, I... I... if there is something causing you to be like this... and if... it is an enemy that I must fight..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he did not have a past, Benedict had a present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...then I will attack it with everything I have."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had an ally named Violet Evergarden.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the dusky sky, the still young duo lay themselves bare to each other and made one decision.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hoo, hoo, hoo," the low whispering of birds staged the night as something somewhat eerie.</p>
<p class="null-p">The evenings at Lontano were like those of night-less cities,</p>
<p class="null-p">in which the lights of bars did not turn off even in the dead of the night. What a place so resplendent needed were attention-grabbing buildings, high-grade alcohol and beautiful women. Until the men went to sleep, the women hired to entertain them could not sleep either.</p>
<p class="null-p">At present, a lone woman was coming out of a bar that still had its lights on, clad in a black trench coat that could as much as melt into the nightly darkness. She was a captivating blonde beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where you going?" asked a man who stood by the entrance of the bar with a fierce look.</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman showed him an empty box of tobacco that belonged to a regular costumer of the bar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cigarettes."</p>
<p class="null-p">The women who worked in bars had to report everything they did. Their bodies themselves were the merchandize. Unlike normal goods, bodies could walk on their own will.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should they disappear somewhere, there would be no business.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Linda's store is still open. I was told to go buy more. If you don't hurry and let me go, you'll get scolded for stopping me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had intended to speak nonchalantly, yet her frame trembled underneath the trench coat. The man eyed her body from head to toe.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nighttime. That's not like the middle of the day. I'll go.</p>
<p class="null-p">Can't let you go by yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to smoke outside for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, it can't be that you're planning to run away again, right? You were almost killed before, weren't you? If you haven't learned the hard way after that, you're an idiot. Until you pay your debts, you're the same as livestock."</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman's lips trembled at being called "livestock".</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not my debt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's your man's, right? He's the worst kind of bastard who sells women from a continent he never even walked on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care about him anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if he no longer comes to see you, you brought this upon yourself. Got no choice but make up for it. Don't go thinking of stupid stuff... Hitting women ain't our thing either."</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman thrust the empty tobacco box at him as if to hand it over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really was asked to get the cigarettes. If you think it's a lie, go ask about it inside. If you believe me, you can come along. Then I can breathe the air outside a little, and you don't have to worry about me running away. We're settled with that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man clicked his tongue at the provocative wording, yet seemed to have complied. He asked another employee to take over his post and made an agreement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you take too long..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman waited stiffly as the men talked. Eventually, the two started walking down the stone-paved road illuminated by streetlights.</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman observed the man. She was there due to being sold by the person she used to be in love with, but she suspected that the man was also being made to work in that shop because of some reason. She might be wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if that were the case, in her present condition, she did not have the compassion of others. If she wanted to break free from her current state, which, as the man said, had unfolded from something that she herself had done...</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's cold... Aren't you chilly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">...she had to act on her own. Even if she was counting with the assistance of a savior, since she had devised the plan by herself, it was her own power.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lights of the tobacco store became visible. Just a bit more and they would reach it.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Please, please, please, help me, God.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can smoke one cigarette, but we're going back as soon as you're done."</p>
<p class="null-p">--Help me, help me, help me!</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why the woman firmly squeezed her eyes shut was to deliver her wish to the God that resided somewhere out there, but even if she were not doing so, she surely would have closed her eyes either way.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was because someone had abruptly come running from an alley and whispered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo, the meeting spot was here, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the one who had spoken was of a much shorter stature than the man, the kick lunged at him crushed his nether regions, and so the former immediately put a hand over his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she recognized the face of the person applying force so that the man would not let out a single scream, the woman said,</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Please! Stop! He's not a bad person!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Until a while before, she had not cared for the other, but upon actually seeing something terrible happen to him, that feeling flew off the nest. Perhaps listening to her plea, the lout who had appeared so suddenly took her hand and vanished into the alley from which he had come.</p>
<p class="null-p">The golden hair of the man running in front of her shone glisteningly even at night, within an alley that did not have illumination. Unlike her wig, it was a natural sandy-blond.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-Big Brother!" the woman called the man going ahead with a tone mixed in rapture.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, what she received in return was gunfire, "Drop it; that's gross."</p>
<p class="null-p">While running, the lout ‐ Benedict Blue ‐ clicked his tongue. As the woman was slow at running, he pulled her forward roughly.</p>
<p class="null-p">A shoe came off the woman's foot. It was a high-heel one. She wore it because it made the shape of her legs seem bewitching and pleased men. It was not suited for running.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My shoe came off!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take off the other!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being yelled at, the woman did as told and took off the other pair while crying. They were shoes that gleamed silver of which she was fond. However, at the moment, she did not need beauty. She resumed running with all her might.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey. W-Why... are you being so cold? You're going to help me, right? I'm your sister, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the question asked with restraint, Benedict answered with a disappointed voice,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, about that: it was my misunderstanding."</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking off her shoe, she was fast at running. The woman increased her speed, as to be side-by-side with the one pulling her arm. "Eh?" Her voice reversed to her original one in lieu of the extreme course of events.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I kinda thought I'd seen you before... but my colleague told me to trace back the few memories I have of my life, and when I tried doing that, you were there. I did know you. But you ain't my sister."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the one who ripped off everything I had on me and threw me away in the Inkar-usi desert, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Still silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I remember until the point where I slept with a fine woman. I don't recall her face. But, this... blond hair that looks fake... tangled in my fingers big time when I stroked it; that's the only thing that stayed in my memory. I was mad drunk, wasn't I? I'd earned the biggest amount of reward money until then, so I guess I got cocky."</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman tried to halt on the spot. However, Benedict forcefully pulled her along.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't stop! Run!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to! You're telling me you'll make me yours next!? I won't be anyone's any longer! I hate men! I don't want to live through being used by someone anymore! I want to go back to me homeland!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There were tears surfacing in the woman's eyes, but Benedict was not the type of man to falter at such a thing. He grabbed the woman's dress by the collar, and after snapping his head backward at once, he followed the momentum and head-butted her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two writhed in pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I said I'm taking you back! Who needs someone like you, shithead!? It's not like I've forgiven you! If I hadn't been picked up by one hell of a good guy after that, I would've killed you a long time ago!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you've found out about my lie, then why...!? I pretended to be your sister and asked you to break me out, y'know!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just told you, didn't I!? Thanks to you abandoning me in a desert, I'm the most blessed ever now! If I hadn't met that guy back there, I wouldn't even have a name and would be sleeping with women somewhere and waking up completely broke! All because I ended up scoring a fate good enough to rewind my life until that point from a shitty goddess like you! It only so happens that you almost tricked me, but I felt like saving you! Okay?! I hate you, so keep just that in mind! Once</p>
<p class="null-p">I help you out, be careful of the roads at night!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After spitting out abusive language again with another "shithead", Benedict made the woman run.</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman could not believe it. Up until now, she had told countless men who had slipped into her body about her personal history and attempted to earn their help.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she had no one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've got a terrible look in your eyes, huh. Mine's pretty terrible too."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had no one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have amnesia. I used to have a little sister... but I can't remember her."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had no one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, your hair reminds me of my sister's; can I stroke it?" She had no one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll raise your pay if you stay until morning, so be here. It's been a while since the last time I wasn't alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had no one, and so, she had thought it would be all right to deceive somebody.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tears poured incessantly. They flowed down as if to block her mouth and nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was hard to breathe. Even so, she had to say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry..." while sobbing, the woman apologized to Benedict.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for lying to you! I'm sorry for those two times!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! I told you I wouldn't forgive you, didn't I!? Those two times! I won't forgive for the rest of my life!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But-But, I'm sorry! Sorry for pretending to be your sister!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle of passing through the alley, they heard gunshots from behind for some reason. The ones who monitored her ‐ a merchandize ‐ had probably come chasing the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict took a peek backwards, but continued running without minding it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They've come after us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict was already replying to the woman's shouts with a, "Shut up!" as easily as breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bullets went past their feet and sides. However, the gunning that was intense at first gradually diminished as the two rushed through the alley. Benedict shot back behind his shoulder as a diversionary action, but did not attempt to hit the other party at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once they reached the end of the alley, Benedict kicked off the half-open lid of a skewer route and opened it fully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, fall!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He kicked the woman into it. He did hear her scream, but having climbed the way up, he was aware that it was not too great a descent. Before going down as well himself, he looked at a certain direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"V..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Beyond his gaze was a comrade of his, who had promised to hit his enemies with all of her power as an interceptor.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">She was on the top of a tree far away from the current position of Benedict and the woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet Evergarden, who was sniping the group that chased after them, had taken aim upon confirming that gunshots were coming from said group. She targeted the firearm in their hands and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">The perfect trajectory of her bullets passed by Benedict and the woman's sides, hindering the people that obstructed their way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Realizing that his own gun had been flicked away by someone, the man who had fired the first shot raised his voice in astonishment, "You're kidding me, right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was in shock, the unseen sniper continued attacking. One of them attempted to target and shoot at the back of the woman, who was falling behind as she ran, but also had his weapon destroyed before he fired, and although he was attacked, he was easily able to defend himself against it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't shoot without thinking! We're under aim!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Another yelled, but on such a dark night in an alley like that, the panic of having someone snipe only their weapons so precisely caused the men to lose their normal nature.</p>
<p class="null-p">"STAY AWAAAAY!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A legend of the battlefields, unknown to those who lived in cities through making women into food, was making them insane. They blindly faced the sky and shot at random. Bullets came flying to Violet's direction as well, but did not as much as touch her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Guns had something called "effective range distance". The guns used by the men were not suited for long-range shooting. Things also depended on the skills of the person using it, so differences in distance occurred even with that type of gun.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a long-range rifle adopted by the military, Violet was taking aim from her position on a tree that the men absolutely could not see.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Target seized... Fire."</p>
<p class="null-p">The sounds of shooting echoed.</p>
<p class="null-p">From far away, she could see someone's gun falling down from his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fire, hit."</p>
<p class="null-p">She moved mute and quickly, as if carrying out a simple job.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fire, hit, fire."</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be fine if her face distorted in pain from the impact of shooting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fire."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Violet's facial expression bore no emotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fire."</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, as everything became quiet, while exhaling a deep breath, Violet ceased to shoot and descended to the root of the tree. It would seem that the long-range shotgun she had bought just recently with her own salary had done a satisfactory work for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she succeeded at the "back-up fire" in the literal sense of the term, she immediately left the spot.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The shooting battle that took place in the city of Lontano over the night turned into a much bigger occurrence than Benedict and the others had imagined, and the situation got to the point of the military police being dispatched.</p>
<p class="null-p">It so happened that people other than the woman behind the scandal had blended with the confusion of the turmoil and fled the city from the shadows, but those were stories unknown to Benedict and Violet.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few hours had passed since the troublesome escape feat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! Hurry and put them on!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a world wherein flowed the light of dawn, Benedict threw the shoes he had been wearing on the woman's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">While muttering complaints about him flinging the shoes at her, the woman tied them on.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been running around the whole night and shaking off their chasers with Benedict, so her feet were injured and wet with blood. The pain was severe, but the exhilaration of managing to escape allowed her to feel as if it did not matter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moreover, as she put on Benedict's shoes, although they were too big, it became easier for her to walk in comparison to when she was not wearing anything on her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict was shoeless instead. He had cut wounds in his entire body. His clothes were ripped everywhere as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up... Don't ask so many times."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it's just... I keep wondering why. Until now, nobody had helped me out, so it's very strange to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">At those words, the face of Claudia Hodgins crossed Benedict's mind. His good-natured employer and lifesaver. He, too, had bestowed Benedict with clothes and shoes when the latter was naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I also kept asking why, I guess.</p>
<p class="null-p">People who had never been treated kindly would think of unconditional love as the beginning of something terrifying. They firmly believed that everything others would bring them was either reprimanding or abuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I told you, didn't I? It's 'cause I was picked up by a good guy. That's why."</p>
<p class="null-p">A small smile escaped him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">His name called from behind, Benedict turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">With leaves on her head, their accomplice of the day, Violet Evergarden, was holding out tickets for the first train of the morning, which would now depart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, take this as well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with the ticket, she left in the woman's hands a bag of freshly baked bread presumably bought in a nearby shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman eyed the bread and Violet alternately, tears forming in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem. Be careful on your way..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the one that had least to do with this... Thank you, really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. It has to do with me. I was his 'back-up fire', after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing that, Benedict laughed loudly. When she had talked about being his back-up fire, the connotation was simply of lending a hand, and he had not thought she would actually put it to practice.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Violet and Benedict were the only ones who knew the meaning of that, the woman tilted her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict... you too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Use 'Mister'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mr. Benedict, you too, thank you very much...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again, be careful on the roads at night."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict replied with a threat incorporated to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time of depart had still not come. The duo, having decided to leave her there and disperse, finished their farewells with a "see ya" and started walking away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hum! Mr. Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps still having something to say, once Benedict turned around, the woman was smiling, her blond hair fluttering in the morning wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, I had an older brother... I haven't seen him for years now, so I can't remember him, but when I was a child, I used to call him 'Big Bro'... I really did have those feelings in mind when I called you that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I were your little sister, I'd definitely search the whole world for a big brother like you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You ain't her, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not! But one day, for sure-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">One day, you will find her, the woman smiled faintly.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Benedict's sky-blue orbs opened wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">An indescribable, strange feeling rushed throughout his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so-called memories were provided to people by travelling across not only their souls but also the particulars of their bodies, and if they could be remembered through a small trigger in case something was forgotten, it might turn out as that sort of feeling, like a tingle from an electric shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman waved, still smiling. He did not tell her to shut up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stu~pid..."</p>
<p class="null-p">His voice trembled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Turning roundly on his heels, Benedict started walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet followed him from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Aah, I...</p>
<p class="null-p">His vision was shaky.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Why? Why did I think she was my little sister?</p>
<p class="null-p">He could now clearly tell. She was not at all like his sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Firstly, although both were blonde, the shades of their hair were completely different, and although his sister was also fine-looking, she and that woman had different characteristics.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, his sister was not such a lustful beauty, but instead had more of a fickle appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a well-behaved voice tone and demeanor, and was not the kind of person who would refer to others as "you".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, please wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">To begin with, she rarely ever called him "Big Bro" and mostly called him by his name. He did not remember that name, but he remembered her calling it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, you will trip if you walk like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">--Aah, out of all things... out of all things...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, why are you crying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Out of all things, he just had to remember his little sister because of a smile from the woman who had knocked him off into hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, welcome back, my friend who no longer knows his own name."</p>
<p class="null-p">--She was a crybaby and a scaredy-cat. She'd always hide behind my back and follow me in trots. I liked the most when she'd come running at my direction after spotting me. That's why I'd make her look for me on purpose sometimes. The times when we were together were happy, and the rest was hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did have a little sister. She was there all the time. That's for sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">In my oldest memory, she was by my side. It was really cold when we woke up. We were in a place that was like a stone tower. She was the closest to me, and was shivering too. The adults hadn't given us any blankets, so I called her over and the two of us clung to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I asked, "Who are you again?", her face looked like she was about to cry and she said, "Don't forget me.". I was told afterward that she was my little sister, so I thought, "That's right".</p>
<p class="null-p">She said I was in a pretty bad condition. That I'd almost died because of a head injury that apparently I myself had earned. That I was quick to want to die when my ego blew off. I'd get disposed of if I went crazy just one more time.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why she cried to me, begging me to stay sane.</p>
<p class="null-p">My sister remembered a lot more than I did. We actually didn't live in that place and we did have a family. But people would forget things little by little in that place.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I asked if she was certain that I was her older brother, she replied that she was. "You're forgetting stuff too, right? How do you know?" I asked. When I pressed with a, "That's right, how can you know?", she cried even more that, "I have the feeling of love left in me, so we're family". She had a weird personality, but after those words, I thought I just had to protect my sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">The adults called the tower, "home".</p>
<p class="null-p">At "home", small children were recruited to do adult works. There were all kinds of jobs. Like delivering things, or retrieving them. Jobs in which someone would die when I performed that sorta labor. Those who were good at work were also ordered more direct stuff. It seems I'd gone nuts when they piled up.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you failed your duties, your little brother, little sister, older brother or older sister ‐ the smallest numbers of each of our family members ‐ would get killed. The people that knew and loved us were hostages. Well, that does make people go mad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Home" was like a tiny military unit. We always went to different places. From what the adults would say, "home" was a temporary employee placement livelihood. They were preparing human resources able to endure any type of battle mission from scratch. Come to think of it now, they'd give me medicines and incense without a break every day for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">My sister, myself and the others, who were forgetting a lot of things, were apparently human resource pupils. From what my sister told me, in that jumble of children, I was the most apt for those jobs. It seemed I was the one who took the biggest amount of medicine, so my forgetfulness was pretty bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Could humans be created from scratch after being made to forget everything? On top of that, could they be raised into the strongest human resources? The answers were "yes" and "no" ‐ you could say both.</p>
<p class="null-p">We'd end up going crazy at just one cogitation. We were quick to become suicidal. There was no meaning in soldiers who couldn't be used for long. I was probably insane but pretended to be normal for my sister's sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">The adults would say that they'd hire us once we grew up. That, for the moment, we were livestock.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that the adults monitoring us had lived like us in the past. "Aren't there only idiots here?" I thought. They hadn't learned anything even after those horrible things were done to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">I decided that, if we had to become adults in that hell, we'd better run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">My sister was crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">If we tried to escape, the adults would come to kill us for sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">The feeling of wanting to die had always been in me. If I was gonna die anyway, I'd wanted to die for my sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whoever did something to her that she didn't want to was shit. I wanted to kill them.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the only pretty thing in that pathetic world. I don't know if she was really my sister. But even if we just happened to have the same hair and eye color, she was my everything. She was the girl I'd wanted to protect the most in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was all I had...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your Big Bro will protect you, *****, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was all I had……. I'd surely failed to set my sister free.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tears poured from Benedict's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shit..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The tears that poured from them flowed continuously, eventually penetrating the earth and disappearing without fulfilling any purpose. They would nevermore return. Never would they go back to the eyes that had produced them. Similarly, the important person who had poured out of Benedict's life would surely not return.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Life... is shit.</p>
<p class="null-p">In his memory of taking her by the hand amidst the night, running away and, lastly, watching the boat from the bottom of the sea, if his sister was on that boat, just how would her young self have survived afterward? Had she drifted and been picked up by some kindhearted person? Had his overprescribed sibling survived just fine after forgetting about him and about herself? Was she living well somewhere under that same sky even as they were unable to see each other?</p>
<p class="null-p">That was but a dream story.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world seemed filled with happy stories, but they were actually very few. Stories and real life were...</p>
<p class="null-p">--I didn't need a life like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, Benedict's life tasted of the sea. It was too salty and undrinkable. Such was it even now. The tear droplets that spilled down his cheeks, passed by his lips and dripped from his chin had the flavor of the ocean.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict's past was chasing him and strangling his neck, so as to kill him from sadness. He wanted to scream and break into wails, asking, "Why?".</p>
<p class="null-p">--End it right now. God, why're you doing this? End it right now. God, there's no salvation for me. Please help me. End it right now. God, I can't breathe because of the pain in my chest brought by this sadness. Hurry, as soon as possible, right now, bring this life...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't go crazy; don't die," she had asked of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">--...to an end...!</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet he chose death.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, surely, his sister had already died long before.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had always fled from such truth. He had merely forgotten about it. Things such as wishing that he would not die in a desert and thinking about eating bread with someone had stemmed from his made-up other self.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was simply a fake that had pretended to be sane and survived somehow. Even if he was in the past, his original self had yearned to die for a long time. It was false of him to be currently living and showing gratitude to somebody. He certainly had forgotten what should not have been forgotten because it was easier that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">The painful and the easy. When sorting them out, he had picked the easy. There was no mistaking that he had wanted to try forgetting everything and live freely.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was cursed for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Was it fun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he were asked so, he could answer that it was great fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Yeah, all of it was fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">In his new life, after meeting that man, the humidity and temperature of the of the continent he was brought to upon being picked up were different, and everything was fresh. The motorcycle that he was granted in place of holding onto a gun or sword had showed him many worlds.</p>
<p class="null-p">He merely delivered things. He had thought it was only that, but upon seeing it for the first time, being a postman was difficult. Every day, he was at loss from being scolded by the clients or receiving excessive gratitude. It was strange for someone like him, who had never gotten a letter, to be delivering them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oddly enough, whenever he saw the smiles of the people on the receiving end, he would feel as if he were doing an extremely good deed. He had found it weird that a postal agency had been chosen for starting a business and was unused to it, but he had come to understand that the reason for being of such job was to perform labor.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was simply delivery. If one was able to walk or to ride a motorcycle, be it a woman, man, child or elder ‐ anyone could do it. It did not have to be him. It was not a work that only he could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he thought that this mere delivery was not bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">He deemed it as fun. Deliveries in which he was able to please others were enjoyable.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what he did, the sights he would see were unlike the ones from when he was a mercenary. The small discoveries that he would find during a delivery ‐ minor things such as there being a delicious bakery or going faster by taking a certain road ‐ were fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">But more enjoyable than anything else was that he had a place to go back to, no matter to what part of the world he went. Even as he returned in tatters, once he opened the office's door, there was someone who would say, "Aah, welcome back, Benedict. Good work.".</p>
<p class="null-p">In the world where he had started walking as if he had suddenly been born, ever since he had met that man, yes, it did seem foolish, but the world had gained colors as though he had met his fated woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It was fun, it was fun, it was fun, it was fun, it was fun. I shouldn't have enjoyed himself, and yet, I had so much fun. What have you been doing? Why were you enjoying it? You weren't in position to. You're a person who should've died without knowing what "fun" was. Be over, be over, be over, be over. Everything should come to an end. Let's end this version of me now. Ain't that better for everyone? There'd be no harm for anybody if there was one less person like me, with no family or lover, in the world. I've had enough fun. As for the people who'll be sad for me, it's enough if I can count them with one hand. I'll erase myself and make this dirty world clean in the end. You shouldn't be having fun. What you gotta do is just one thing: go face your sister, who's smiling inside your head.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why Benedict impulsively searched for his gun with one of his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, people died that way. Sorrow would seal their throats and they would die unable to breathe. They would die from having more sad moments than happy moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt that he would not be able to live even if for another second. It was not that he wished to die. Rather, he was taking a decision for himself that he had to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was there any living being that wanted to die as soon as it was born? Most of them supposedly wanted to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, they wanted to live. Live a wonderful life, if possible. A life that would make being born worthwhile.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it by no means went well all the time. Life was not something that one would prepare beforehand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh... uuugh..."</p>
<p class="null-p">As a result of choices made, there were countless changes. There were times in which only grievous things would happen. A series of things such as regretting being born.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hardships were like gelid rain that God would pour over anyone. It would be great there was a place to take shelter from it or an umbrella, but there were times when one could not find them. The prolonged rain would cause one's body to grow cold and the roots of their teeth to shake. For people, it</p>
<p class="null-p">was something difficult to endure. When it became impossible to withstand, people... "Sto... p."</p>
<p class="null-p">...would crave death.</p>
<p class="null-p">"St... o..."</p>
<p class="null-p">When living became hard, they tended to look for what was easier. It was nothing strange. What was wrong with running away? The least amount of pain was better. The shortest suffering was better.</p>
<p class="null-p">The purpose of living creatures was something that they decided on themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sto... p."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, yes...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop."</p>
<p class="null-p">...the same had happened when he was in that desert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop it; why...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain number of people, beloved by the Goddess of Fortune, were able to filter out of such instance. If one thoroughly prodded into it, they would find it was but the result of something that had been piling up.</p>
<p class="null-p">The work of the Goddess happened in a vivid way. If one were to ask what exactly that was...</p>
<p class="null-p">"V..."</p>
<p class="null-p">...it would be somebody showing up to hold whoever's hand when they attempted to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the cliff of his life, the one who had acted as his back-up fire appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">What the Goddess brought about was different for each person. For Benedict Blue, in the present moment...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">...it was Violet Evergarden.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/violet-evergarden/illustrations/violet-evergarden_vol_03_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">--Why're you holding my hand, out of all things?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as the older brother who had grabbed onto his younger sister's hand in the darkness, Violet gripped Benedict's.</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon squeezing it once, she changed her hold into that of lacing fingers together and walked on, guiding him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, let's go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he had been unable to take a single step, he wound up walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is no good."</p>
<p class="null-p">He could not take his gun while she was holding his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you are crying, you cannot see what lies ahead."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he wanted to shoot a bullet into his head, he could not.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will pull you by the hand, yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being told by that girl, who resembled his sister, to return home...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">...he wound up thinking that, aah, he had to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">"V..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why he had not been able to leave her on her own one way or another from the first time he had seen her was that their appearances were similar.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both had golden hair and blue eyes, and were somewhat lonely. He felt as if he had always, always made of her something like a substitute for his sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"V... I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was unable to take his eyes off her and even referred to her by a nickname.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I... probably... killed... my little sister... I've remembered it..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he had forgotten his sister, some part of him ended up thinking that, if she were alive, she would have turned out that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">His tears became unstoppable at his own idiocy. He would wonder,</p>
<p class="null-p">--Why did my past self fail if she was so important to me?</p>
<p class="null-p">"We abated halfway, and I got separated from her... UUugh... It's... It's like I killed her..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet clasped his hand even tighter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You do not know that yet, right?" Rather than like a younger sister, she was like an older one. "Just as that person said, you might meet her again one day." she whispered as if to admonish him, as if to soothe him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible... Impossible... I was definitely the only one...</p>
<p class="null-p">the only one who survived... I... I was..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He shed too many tears, the words cut off by his weeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was suffocating.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted that suffocation to end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, nothing is definite. My Major was alive too. Who can 'definitely' say that your sister is dead?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The hand that she had joined fingers with throbbed. However, were it not for that pain, it felt as if he would soon let go and kill himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But... But y'know..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have dealt with quite a lot today. We can deal with it from now on too. Is that not right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was... I was... better off dead...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Crying that way, just like a child... was foolish, Benedict thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no turning back anything anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was better off dead!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he cried, he had already lost her. He had no idea where in the world to look for her either. Should joined hands let go, if the other party was not nearby, they could not be joined again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's legs stopped completely. Did the crying Benedict look like a little boy to her? She came closer, forcing his head over her shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go back, Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To the company. You and I only have that place."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, they did not have anywhere else. The people who would wait for them and hold their ground without going insane were indeed nowhere but there.</p>
<p class="null-p">--But is it okay for me to go back?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've... done horrible things in the past. It's just nobody knows that I... when I was mercenary..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did a lot of stupid stuff. It's not forgivable just 'cause I was a kid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I... But..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The face of Claudia Hodgins crossed his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I shouldn't... go back.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sense of exhilaration as he walked for the first time with the loose-fitting shoes that man gave him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The jokes the other would tell while spewing complaints when hanging out with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The laughter from when they would drink and make a ruckus together.</p>
<p class="null-p">--But...</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyebrows lowering whenever he was troubled. His back arching whenever Lux was angry with him. The sweet voice he used only for women. The strength he showed to him. He was the only good-natured person in the world that could become attached to an amnesiac man who had nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I do wanna go back.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to return to that good-natured person so, so keenly that it filled him with tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so, you will live, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict dry-swallowed. Those words almost felt like a bullet shot into his chest. He was so surprised that he became wordless. She was normally a taciturn and did not use decorated words. But she would sometimes boldly bring the truth to light.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You will live, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A little bit of pleading was mixed in Violet's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hand that Violet had joined with his. Her artificial fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's count the things you have done and the things you</p>
<p class="null-p">will do from now on, so that you shall not forget."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were proof of the things she had lost and the things she had broken. As well as a symbol of regeneration. Such fingers delicately laced him in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Until you die someday."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl in front of him had accepted that agony much sooner than he had, without running away or averting her eyes from it, and simply stayed amidst the sadness. "Today... For today, let's go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was Violet Evergarden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, let's walk. Do you recall that our shift was only until morning and that our day off would start at noon?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gradually, but still by pulling his hand, she guided</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yesterday, we wound up going back to Lontano without finishing our reports. We had promised Lux that we would submit them today without fail. We are too tattered to go to work looking like nothing happened. Surely, if we show up to work like this, there might be a huge scandal, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Benedict was told so, they surfaced in his head ‐ his quarreling comrade from the founding day, Cattleya; Lux, who had been picked up from an isolated island; their colleagues from CH Postal Company; the city of</p>
<p class="null-p">Leidenschaftlich; his own past; his current occupation; his new name and the man who had given it to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if Old Man will be mad..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Claudia Hodgins. The man who gave him everything he had now.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to see the other very much. As he reminisced to the other's voice and face, his chest seemed about to burst.</p>
<p class="null-p">In Benedict's life, his past included, Hodgins had been the only adult to provide for and protect him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were able to meet President Hodgins because you were alive. You can find your sister as well. Surely... People like us are no good if we do not believe so, Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had enough strength to live by himself, no matter where.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today was very tiring, right? Let's go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the warmth of having a guardian changed</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict, who used to loathe ties of obligation. The CH Postal Company, which Violet said to go back to, had already become his place of return.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict looked at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Sun was rising. Behind him, the shadow that the night had melted into was now reflected richly. The road ahead was brightly illuminated. Just like the past and the present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, V."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Violet asked what the matter was, he muttered while wiping his tears with the sleeve of his shirt,</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing about me crying is a secret between us two."</p>
<p class="null-p">The figures of the two as they walked on holding hands probably looked like that of siblings who got along well.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right now, your life is all you have, isn't it? I'll buy that."</p>
<p class="null-p">At those words, the man's heart started making loud noises. He was supposedly used to exchanging his life for money, but he seemed about to stop breathing at being asked for it faceto-face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being asked, the man was at loss.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dunno." As he answered seriously, Hodgins laughed, "What a fool; give a high price."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could give a sum that I can't pay for, so that I'd have to hire you for the rest of my life."</p>
<p class="null-p">For an instant, he had not understood what was said, and so he answered after a moment,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't wanna! Whatcha saying!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, you have nothing, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't keep saying 'nothing'!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We'd be like a family if we're together, even if we aren't related by blood. Just give a price that I can't pay." "Hah?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said, we could be like a family. Well, that's fine. More importantly, your name."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, hey, you're definitely a weirdo, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's come to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Old Man! It's like you're not listening to what I say, ain't it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right. Listen ve~ry well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You listen well!"</p>
<p class="null-p">With an extremely happy-looking face and little shyly,</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins said,</p>
<p class="null-p">"It might be a bit pretentious. I understand his feelings now. Ah, no, y'see, it's my own feelings, so to say. I'm putting into it my wish of wanting a young one like you to be this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that second, the only one in the world who witnessed the shine in those blue eyes was Claudia Hodgins.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It means 'blessed'; how about 'Benedict'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew for the first time the joy of having his life blessed by someone at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's take it after the god that administers divine protection. Leave 'Blue' to be your surname. The name you gave yourself plus my 'Benedict'. 'Benedict Blue'. Yup, it's a good name. Nice to meet ya, Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as he became hurt when replaying his memories, he would be blessed whenever someone called his name.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stu~pid..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not want to let go of that blessing ever again.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, Benedict and Little Violet. Welcome ba... Hey, this isn't okay! What happened...!? You two come here! Little Lux, the first-aid kit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Albeit a little long, that was the story of Benedict Blue.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 04: Cattleya Baudelaire</p>
<p class="null-p">Writing letters was similar to singing tunes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pleased to make your acquaintance. I rush anywhere my customers might desire. I am from the Auto-Memories Doll service, Cattleya Baudelaire."</p>
<p class="null-p">Such was the pet theory of a certain Auto-Memories Doll, and she truly did think that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'm going to begin, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Singing required people to put together a scenario in their heads, and therefore, it was also similar to painting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Mert, have you been doing fine? Thank you for the letter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Your letters are encouragement for me.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she would take a breath to begin writing was when she would start singing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, I mistyped. Let's do it over."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the recipient received the letter, how would they react? How would they feel about those words?</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's natural that you want to tell him to study hard... but if that occupies most of the letter, it'll get tiring. Your younger brother was pushed into a boarding school, right? It doesn't look like he'd have much fun there, so I think it's better to take the direction of saying that he'll grow up the way you did and become free from home if he puts effort into his studies.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if we write about you praising yourself too much, it'll get boring, so let's be moderate. All the more if you want to receive a reply."</p>
<p class="null-p">She would picture it in her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, then, on from where we stopped."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a beginning and an end to melodies. How they could differ from being remarkable or otherwise gently cheerful depended on the song she was playing, but from the start to the middle, things would gradually become more exciting.</p>
<p class="null-p">The typewriter's noise was the piano. The rustling of the fountain pen was the violin. Lastly, the clatter of the cymbal would ensue, bringing it to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How's that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The finished letter turned into a living being. Each sound of each word danced about, and human vitality could be felt in the smell of ink. The letter had become a story.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya Baudelaire performed her ghostwriting in that fashion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Auto-Memories Dolls and their customers were worldbuilding cooperators that created the tales, music and images called "letters". The more time they spent together and the richer the contents of the letters were, the closer their hearts would be to one another. However, there were people who would reach that level at once, even within an unusually short span.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you... accept going out with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Such as that client.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">As of late, a certain establishment was popular in Leiden, the capital of Leidenschaftlich.</p>
<p class="null-p">The owner of the building that used to be a reception hall had reformed it into a space where people could enjoy sweets and music ‐ "Café Magnolia".</p>
<p class="null-p">The citizens of Leiden admired the place, in which one was only finally allowed to enter through waiting for a month after having made a reservation. It was a desired spot where people would have their eyes watering at the decorations of the marvelous interior and could bask in the music of pianists whom remained there constantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The players changed depending on the day and hour. Perhaps because a place where young musicians performed was also a place for seeking patrons, the age range of the visitors was wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">As they let out emotional sighs, it would seem that Cattleya and the one sitting with her were the youngest in the shop. Just as the rumors had it, the prices in the menu handed to them were high, but as they saw the dishes brought over, they understood the worthiness of the investment. Money could hardly purchase the emotion instigated by a three-level cake stand.</p>
<p class="null-p">She and her companion decided to pick the items they liked one by one. Firstly, after much indecision, she chose the apple pie. Excitedly bringing closer the plate of apple pie that was next to her, she thrust her fork into it. Upon having one mouthful, she realized that it was what she had wanted. Eating something sweet inside a warm shop was the true pleasure of winter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux Sibyl, who sat across her, was unable to lay her hand on a chocolate cake even as it sat in front of her. It looked extremely delicious. Cattleya wanted to eat it.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the waiter had brought the cakes in the middle of their conversation, the topic cut off completely at the good part.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya, and then what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the best... Ah~, really~, thanks for hanging out with me, Lux! Isn't this place so expensive? Besides, you can't finish a three-level stand if you don't love sweets. Everyone told me no, but isn't that stupid? You'd have to be pretty dumb not to eat this, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep, I think it's a wonderful shop. Well, then, Cattleya-"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to interrupt Lux as she at last uttered those words,</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya continued,</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, have you heard? Didn't the President buy some land? Like, the one he made into a base for our production factory. They say there's a legendary waterfall near that village. If you bring home a stone from the bottom of the water, your dreams come true... How about we go together next time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This kind of legend is no use if you go with someone, right? But that's not it, Cattleya. I want to get back to the previous topic."</p>
<p class="null-p">Putting a sugar block processed into the shape of a star in her tea and mixing it, Cattleya answered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, the talk about me getting asked out, was it? Yep, I declined."</p>
<p class="null-p">"EH~~~~~~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya found herself thinking about strange things, such as how the sugar must be feeling good if it was melting in that kind of tea. It might be that her head was in a daze from the sudden ingestion of too large an amount of sugar. Or was the problem that the two were currently talking about actually the one to blame?</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's 'cause he told me it was on the condition of marriage."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not the first time Cattleya Baudelaire was proposed into a romantic relationship, but that had been the first person to make her conscious of marriage ever since she had been born.</p>
<p class="null-p">"EH~~~~~~~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux, you're noisy."</p>
<p class="null-p">As her voice had indeed been loud, Lux put both hands over her lips after restlessly scanning her surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is he that person who came by the company?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. That person who came by the company is him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have the feeling he was a cool guy... He's a bit older than you, but that's also charming, so to say."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Cattleya told her to eat up, Lux finally brought the cake into her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">While chewing without uttering her impressions of it, she waited for Cattleya's next words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux, you sure enjoy listening to other people's love matters even though you yourself aren't in a relationship, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do. I mean, it's still early for me to be into that stuff, so it's like an encounter with the unknown..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux Sibyl had the title of president's secretary, but her figure as she spent her time so peacefully was that of a little girl. Moreover, she had lived most of her life being controlled by a cultist organization, and so she was most certainly a novice to everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no mistaking that Cattleya's was one of the problems in the textbook of romance between women and men.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to try it one day too, but right now, I want to listen to other people's stories. Okay, go on." Lux's heterochromatic eyes were full of curiosity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He runs a perfume store here in Leiden. He's a perfumer. His name is Chris. I passed by his store a while ago and it seems to be doing well. He also looks like a good man; his face isn't bad and he's got a soft demeanor. That's right, he seems like he'd make a good husband if he got married. He's a man that women get attached to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya, don't you like him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked so, Cattleya was deep in thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Between choosing if he was either her type or not, she would say he was. However...</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder. I don't really know. He feels different from what I tend to like."</p>
<p class="null-p">...the face of one person surfaced in her mind. "The one I like isn't a person who'd fall for me, huh." She rested her chin on her hand and sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, President Hodgins. Indeed, I think it's impossible with him. Not because it's you, Cattleya, or anything of the sort. It's because the President plays with fire where it won't harm the company, so with fellow members, that's... He's the sort of person who experiences romance in a properly logical way. He just likes romantic relationships and women, so he doesn't fall in love."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected of someone who was always together with him from morning to night, Lux, who usually gave gentle and modest responses regarding other people, described the individual named Claudia Hodgins with her merciless side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm~. That's right. President Hodgins. He does give off that feeling after all, doesn't he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He does. I think President Hodgins is probably waiting for</p>
<p class="null-p">a fated person. It feels like he won't marry anyone if this person doesn't show up... But a woman that President Hodgins would throw everything away for and dedicate himself to is just..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about Violet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the name of the friend that both of them had in common was mentioned, Lux made an X with her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh~, Violet is his family already. Besides, Violet has... that man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I see. It can't be her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, can't be her. That's why I told him that I think there's no such person in the world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What did President Hodgins say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He told me, 'Little Lux, that's horrible; I'll take it out of your pay'. He pretended to be crying."</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya was able to imagine it and burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux did not manage to hold back either and giggled with a "huhuhu".</p>
<p class="null-p">While the conversation became lively, a second serving of black tea arrived. The next cake she picked was a tart decorated with fruits and candy sculptures. It was expectedly delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted Violet, who had come into the topic, to try it as well. She had not seen the latter in a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet was the most demanded Auto-Memories Doll. She was currently somewhere around the continent. It would have been great if she were present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y'know, I'll say this because we ended up talking about it... I declined dating him, but I accepted going together for a meal... with Mr. Chris."</p>
<p class="null-p">If Violet Evergarden were in that place, what would she have said in reply to Cattleya's statement?</p>
<p class="null-p">'Have you become friends with him?'</p>
<p class="null-p">--Yeah, feels like she'd ask something as off-handed as that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although she was not Violet, Lux had a good reaction in her own way. She moved her chair with a clang, pitching forward. The three-level cake stand interfered with the distance between the faces of the duo.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why? I-Is this the beginning of a for-fun relationship?</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya, you do that kind of stuff?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As it was quite a misunderstanding, Cattleya denied with impressive vigor,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wrong, wrong! I may have these looks, but I'm purehearted when it comes to romance, y'know? What I said when I rejected him was that I couldn't date on the premise of getting married to someone I didn't know very well... so the talk turned into 'then please get to know me'... The other was a client, so I couldn't strongly refuse him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh~, how rare. Isn't it so Cattleya-ish to firmly tell the</p>
<p class="null-p">people you don't like that you don't want it? Were you feeling ill?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Ms. Lux. That's badmouthing, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would be badmouthing if I were giving a critique, but as a friend, I like that unwavering side of you. Besides, I think that's essential for Auto-Memories Dolls. Aren't the female Auto-Memories Dolls actually wooed all the time by the costumers? Like, have you heard the rumors about that girl from the Guardian Company?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The one about how she was going to fall into the hands of some big-name politician, but her postman boyfriend showed up climbing the slope, chased him off and confessed to her in the end! I know it! That one really makes my heart race!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get you! To top it off, those two were childhood friends, they say. My, honestly. Isn't that romance novel level?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really like the climax where he goes, 'She's mine~'. From that book you lent me, I mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The 'Chronicles of the Star Knight Order'? From the part where the protagonist offers her body to the grandmaster?</p>
<p class="null-p">Chapter three of the second volume?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That one~! It's very similar to what happened. Huh, aren't we getting off-topic?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are. Sorry, I was the one who deviated from it... Ah, this cake is delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">As the flow of the conversation between the two women turned into a commonplace one, they decided to calm down for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya helped herself to a third cup of tea. The pot became empty, and so they requested seconds to a finelooking waitress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Customers who ordered the three-level cake stand had free second servings of either black tea or coffee. Cattleya deemed it a good arrangement. Such thoughtfulness was important. She was already starting to think about whom she would come with on her next visit to the place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya, is it okay if I eat the scone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure thing. It's plain, though, but is it tasty?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like it a lot. Might like it more than cake. That's right, the continuation. When is your date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"EH~~~~~~~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux, you're noisy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's 'cause..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux protested, her face red. "Hey, hey, if... if you end up thinking after this date that going out with Mr. Chris wouldn't be so bad, it'd be a date on the premise of going out, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would for him, but I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya, if you don't have that intention, it'd be fine if you didn't go, right? You'll go, won't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, tell me the results, 'kay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked so with a grin, Cattleya replied with a "if I feel like it". Lux gave her a sullen look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya took her eyes off the complaining Lux, watching the scenery out the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">The roadside trees that would have been filled with fresh verdure if it were summer, their frames devoid of any leaves and completely naked, as well as the outdoors where cold winds blew fiercely appeared somewhat sad. The people walking on the streets had their backs arched, holding the collars of their coats together.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could also see the figures of postmen running their motorcycles around. Despite not thinking that it was him, Cattleya wound up leaning her body over the window to take a look.</p>
<p class="null-p">It indeed was not him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other did not have blond hair, and even from far away, she could immediately tell that he had a completely different face and body. He just happened to also be a postman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya had overreacted to a mere postman.</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being asked the question by Lux, she answered with "nothing", her voice sounding as though her heart was not there. She sat well-mannered back on her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what happened, really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought it might be him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux asked again, perhaps not having heard it well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Puckering her lips, Cattleya answered, "Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tone was prickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">With an "ah", Lux soon understood what she had been attempting not to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tilting her neck a little, Lux giggled,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Feels like it's been a long time since he left, huh... Whenever I see someone in the city turn around the corner on a motorcycle, I also find myself thinking that it might be Benedict. Everyone asks me if there isn't any correspondence from him yet like it's an every day thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't there any letters or postcards from him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing... Hey... Cattleya, today's the first time you've asked about that, right...? Ever since Benedict reported a leave of absence."</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost like a child being scolded by an adult, Cattleya dropped her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't I...? I-I used to fight with him a lot, but we've been buddies since the founding days!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't say you can't, Cattleya."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's really heartless. He told the President and Violet that he was stepping away from the company!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though... Even though I was also there from the start...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. Makes you lonely, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's honesty precisely described the feeling that Cattleya had been trying to hide.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was lonely. Except, if she were able to say it, she would not be puckering her lips and spouting complaints.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't wanna say that I'm lonely even if my mouth splits!" Cattleya Baudelaire was not that kind of woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">She pierced a cake with her fork and forcibly thrust it into her mouth. She chewed it, downed it at once with tea, and violently pierced the cake again. It might be that she thought of the cake as if it were Benedict.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's already been three months. Winter is ending and it seems like spring's about to arrive, huh... Yet the President doesn't let anyone touch Benedict's motorcycle... I also haven't removed him from the employee name register."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Lux's words almost as consolation for her, Cattleya puffed her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not lonely!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm-hm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The President's being himself too. Simply lets an employee leave when he asks for it without knowing when he'll be back."</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm a disgusting fellow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the truth was that she did not want to be defaming him, she detested having her feelings exposed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if he comes back just like that, I won't talk to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Cause he left without talking to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She spat out her negative emotions as a distraction. She basked in the kindness of Lux, who laughed as if troubled by hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been pondering over someone to listen to what she had to say today in that place. She had chosen Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux said gently, as if to soothe her, "I'd be happy if he came back, though..."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was almost as if she represented Cattleya's inner thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm someone who started working there midway, but I think he's a good person, though he has a foul mouth. After I was brought in by Violet and hired to work under President Hodgins... the one who'd come talk to me every now and then almost looking concerned was Benedict. He's nice to girls younger than him. Besides, thinking about the company's management as the President's secretary, he's needed. There's never enough people in the postmen personnel. Many of them soon quit after being recruited and employed, so people like Benedict, who roam around a lot even while complaining and have leadership skills, are really important staff. He should be involved with the company's management in the future. As the spokesperson of the employees, that is. I'm sure our administrator, the President, feels this way too. Also, Cattleya, there was no helping that you didn't know. I mean, you were far away because of your Auto-Memories Doll work. It might be that Benedict had wanted to tell you but couldn't. No, surely he wanted the number of people he had to say goodbye to to be small. Looks like something really terrible happened to him. Violet and the President won't tell me anything, though. But the two said he'd come back, and Benedict himself has that intention too, so maybe he didn't say it on purpose. Isn't he the kind of person who hates sappy stuff, that guy? Let's wait for our selfish Benedict. I'm also one of the people that he didn't say anything to."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whispered slowly in a quiet and lovely voice, the prolonged statement pierced straight into her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than the contents of what was spoken by Lux, Cattleya was stunned at the excessive broadness of her views and the wideness of her heart's capacity. Lux was a girl younger than her, but could almost be thought of as her mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you have to be such a good kid...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wound up feeling miserable about how immature she was despite being the older one in their afternoon tea party.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, they left all sorts of things aside, fooling around and going on a stroll for the first time in a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">They went through bookshops and adorable general stores, as well as fashion boutiques for their respective differing tastes. Whenever the clerks asked, "Are you sisters?", they would laugh and answer, "We're colleagues and friends".</p>
<p class="null-p">As sunset time came about, they headed to the office, holding several shopping bags. Cattleya tagged along with the diligent Lux, who claimed she wanted to get over with at least a little of the work that she had left undone the previous day.</p>
<p class="null-p">With nothing to do, Cattleya went to the president's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins was absent, a cactus and small potted plants sitting on the president's desk instead with an odd sense of displacement to them, as well as a note that used them as paperweight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Business and dinner. Be back at night." it said.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she showed it to Lux, the latter deciphered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"This means going out for dinner with the woman he's making a move on lately." with a displeased face.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed he would in fact properly come back at night. That much was a given, for he had his residence in the company.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two had dinner together afterward and split. As they had talked so much, although she bid her farewells cheerfully, Cattleya felt lonely after walking three steps.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would be on vacation the next day as well. While dispirited and lonesome from parting ways with someone even though she knew they would see each other again soon, she went home. She spotted a stray cat on the way and gave chase, but did not manage to pet it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once she sat on the slightly dusty bed of the residence that she did not come back to very often immediately upon arriving, she lay down naturally. She then stirred up with a "shouldn't do that, shouldn't do that" and wiped off her make-up.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her stunning facial features, people frequently thought that Cattleya's make-up was too dense, but there was actually not much difference from before and after she applied it. As each part of her face had a distinct structure, she would merely look a little younger.</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking a hot bath, she took out of her closet a negligee that she had bought but never worn and changed into it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wondering what phase the Moon was in that evening, she looked out the window, but it was not visible. Instead, she could only see the twinkling of a few stars. Dressed in her negligee and brushing her hair, Cattleya eyed the lights of each house.</p>
<p class="null-p">They reminded her that, unlike herself, who was living alone, there were people living in the company of others.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Married couples are actually amazing, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">That form of love, which could be considered a contract carried out all over the world, could not be conceived without a second party. She would probably do it someday. Or so she believed when she was a child, but she had not yet met a man that she would likely marry after having become of age. Perhaps she would never.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Being with someone for your whole life even though it isn't a person that you're in love with would be impossible for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since that was her situation in regards of just marriage, she was even less able to imagine herself having a child. After all, Cattleya thought, she was like a child herself. Even so, as the trends of society were composed in a way that urged her on, she had a vague sense of obligation to do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such sense of obligation caused her to taste a coffee-like bitterness. It was by no means savory.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I wonder if there're other girls out there going to sleep with the same feelings as me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be better if not, but she found herself wishing that there were. She hoped said girls had female friends who could tell them that everything was all right.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm glad I have a job.</p>
<p class="null-p">Working enabled her to deviate a little from the demands that she had as a woman to fulfill such obligation. As she thought about the word "obligation", it pierced her heart indirectly.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Benedict didn't have any obligation to tell me anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been stuck in her mind all along. Much like a small cut, it ached.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya had not been allowed into Benedict's life, plain and simple. Whatever he did was of his own concern. That was all. He was under no commitment to report anything to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, Cattleya had intended to get along well with him. They did fight often, but somehow or other, she had the feeling that he was the one she got along with the best. That had been a misunderstanding on her part.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm... always like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">In Cattleya's life, it was not one or two times that she had misinterpreted getting along with someone when it was actually not the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">--'Cause I'm an idiot.</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be that everyone was putting up with being together with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm... definitely...</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she was the kind of person who could never become somebody's significant other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it caused her to feel anxious and sad, tears coming out of her eyes, and so she rolled onto the bed, covering herself past her head with her blankets. Blocking the outside world had her slightly relieved. She pleaded that the morning did not have to come. Her worries and sorrows would all melt away once she was asleep, much like the sugar in her black tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">--...lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">To think Benedict Blue's absence would make her so weak. "Give up." another side of her reveled in her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right. She had no choice but to give up. He was not fond of her and she no longer had room to enter his life.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'm lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rounding up like a fetus, Cattleya fell asleep.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">As if the coldness of the previous day had been a lie, it was warm out in the next morning. Winter was truly about to end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya stared outside by the windowsill for a while, but started dressing up as if to shake something off. She had decided what she would wear since the day before. With the face of the person that she was going to meet in mind, she had picked from her various colorful outfits a white cache-ccœur one-piece. It was slightly open at the chest, but not as much as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">When people with plump breasts dressed into clothes that did not fit the curves of their bodies, it would seem as though they had put on weight and their shape would expand into a different width as suggested by the outfit, almost as if they were clad in papier mache. It could be said that her attire was the best one to show for the first time out of her personal clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had considered putting on a black cape coat, but as the temperature had risen, she went with a lighter beige-rose gown coat. Lining up her nine-centimeter and five-centimeter heel shoes, she chose a five-centimeter one. They were probably only going to have a meal, but if they happened to go for a walk, nine-centimeter heels would take up time and make her feet hurt. After taking out a clutch bag in which only her wallet and lipstick could fit, she was ready.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she went outside, the landlord of the rented house that she occupied was sitting on a bench at the edge of the road. She greeted him while passing by his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the residential district where Cattleya lived, there were many elderly people living alone, as well as family households. Having been secluding themselves in their homes out of cold during midwinter, the elders were all strolling around. Caught up in their sluggish way of walking upon observing them, her fast pace reduced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Going down the alleyway that led to the central part of the city, she could hear the sound of a piano from somewhere. The player was most likely a child, but they had probably practiced quite a lot with the windows closed in winter. The playing was more skilled than what she had heard back in autumn. It gave her an extremely real feeling that people were taking root and living their lives. In her continuous commissions, she would rush about every day, ignoring such scenery and sounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guess I'll... quit being an Auto-Memories Doll in the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">She found herself wanting to lead an unchanging daily routine in that same city. In that sense, someone who worked in a shop fixed within city lines might be the best relationship partner.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">As she approached the front of the restaurant that they were supposed to meet at, regardless of it being a little earlier than the arranged time, the person in question was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a man of burned-umber hair, with a thin frame but tall stature. He wore a trench coat over a jacket and shirt. He was the perfumer who ran a popular perfume shop in Leiden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mr. Chris."</p>
<p class="null-p">A cache-cœur one-piece had indeed been the right pick, Cattleya thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">The restaurant pointed no dress-coats but the clothes that she had chosen instead. Suitable of a port capital such as Leiden, the restaurant apparently served a delicious shellfish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ms. Cattleya. Thank you for coming. It's warm today, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, spring arrived all at once, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He casually held out his forearm and guided her into the restaurant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of the sweet scent that Hodgins would have, of something like briars within sweet vanilla, he smelled of refreshing greenery.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I prefer President Hodgins's scent.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was fond of the hunger that she felt whenever sniffing</p>
<p class="null-p">it from nearby. Being enveloped by the smell of something sugary gave her a feeling of glee. Today, too, she had actually wanted to eat cake since morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">--What did he smell like again?</p>
<p class="null-p">A blond man who had a bad way with words crossed her mind. Putting on cologne was not his taste. He probably did not smell of anything. One day or other, he would be clad in the scent of rain or reek of sweat ‐ he was the type of man who wore his own odor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about we pick our drinks?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having been shown to her seat, she scanned the menu. For safety, she chose a fruity wine as her drink. When reflecting on what to eat, she was informed that a pre-determined meal course had already been prepared. They had escaped having to evaluate in order to decide.</p>
<p class="null-p">--He's used to this, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">He would smile whenever they locked eyes, and so she would naturally end up smiling too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I got a reply from my little brother to that letter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, how was it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More sincere than the usual. All thanks to you being the one who wrote it. We're far apart in age, so... even though I find him so cute that I can't help myself, he's on one hell of a rebellious phase. It's been hard to communicate my intentions."</p>
<p class="null-p">Starting with appetizers, the two ate in sequence each dish served to them as they were brought over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah... I understand. I'm on the opposite side. I'm the youngest child, and other than me, there's nine... older brothers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Nine'? That's incredible."</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation did not feel unpleasant. Back when being commissioned by him, she had felt from the beginning that he was someone easy to interact with. Never had he become incomprehensibly angry or flared up at her. Like how a certain someone would.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My oldest brother was over ten years older than me, and to a youngest daughter with an older brother like that, the eldest son was someone irritating, 'cause he'd get praised just by showing up at our house while I was always being scolded."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. But I've also had a tough time in the process of my growth."</p>
<p class="null-p">She could tell that he was trying to have her enjoy the conversation. He had an adult composure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"On top of that, Mr. Chris, we think we can't compare to people like you, who reign over the other siblings as someone who works hard and is successful, and we're treated as lesser no matter what we do, so it's even more complicated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder if that's like what I feel towards my father. He's a trader, and I'm no match for him at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you run such a popular store?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have yet to earn passing marks from my father."</p>
<p class="null-p">--Did you ask me out because I reached the passing marks to be your marriage partner?</p>
<p class="null-p">She used the shellfish to push down the words that seemed about to come out of her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In my family, it's customary that everyone has a ship of their own. Want to go for a ride when it gets warmer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That ship is probably not like the kind I have in mind, is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What were you imagining?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being asked so, she answered honestly, "A ferryboat."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a small boat used to move from shore to shore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chuckling, he replied,</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a little bigger than those."</p>
<p class="null-p">From the way he laughed, she guessed it was probably quite a huge ship.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya looked at the man named Christ once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">She liked the gentle eyes that peeked from underneath his burned-umber hair and his slow manner of speaking, she thought. He did not lack anything. On the contrary, she was the one full of defects, which made her want to question why he had chosen her as companion for today.</p>
<p class="null-p">She attempted asking frankly,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why... did you ask me out?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chris showed an aspect of surprise at the prodding into the heart of the matter, but responded levelly without glossing things over,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I often have to be cautious at work, Ms. Cattleya, so I fancy carefree women like you. It's fun, like normal. Being with you, that is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you being super careful right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like that. I mean, sure, I'm making an effort so you'll enjoy yourself. But there's an ease to it. You probably wouldn't be too disappointed if I showed you an ugly side of me in this date, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Ugly side'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like getting pasta sauce on my shirt. Or letting coins spill out of my wallet when paying the check."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do stuff like that too. I'd ask, 'what are you doing~', but I'd help you out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's it; this much carelessness is just great. The costumers who visit my store have a demerit system, so there's no mistaking that we need to have them make their purchases with beautiful gestures and with a sense of refinement to it. I used to think Auto-Memories Dolls were also like that, but you were completely different. The moment we met, you greeted me with a cheerful 'Hello!'. It was also really easy to get advice for the ghostwriting. We'd just met for the first time, but it felt like I was hanging out with some girl who lived in my neighborhood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Our most demanded Doll deals with the costumers in an elegant way, unlike me. I'm... I'm no good. Besides, Mr. Chris, there are many girls like that. Aren't there some of them among the girls that frequent your store?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There aren't beautiful women who are as easygoing and nice as you at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it about my face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, you're cute. You're probably much competed for, but</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to have you, is what I thought. That's my reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told so, in spite of her embarrassment, Cattleya's chest filled with happiness. She wondered how someone who could give off such a feeling of certainty was single. She could not refrain from suspecting that he had some sort of dubious habit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mr. Chris, could it be that you've been married once and have a child or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I haven't yet even taken anyone as my fiancée."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you wander around night after night as a hobby or anything like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a disposition for getting sleepy as soon as I finish eating. I sleep before midnight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you single?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You too, why are you single?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For starters, why do people get married?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As his intonation changed, Cattleya looked at him sternly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's many motives, like the connection of a household and another, the continuation of a bloodline, financial assistance and romance, but don't you think it's okay not to be shackled by the contract called marriage?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You asked me out on the basis of marrying me, yet you say something like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a downcast look, Chris whispered, "How can I put it?" He wiped droplets from his empty champagne glass with his finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"People around my age are treated like deviants if they aren't married... but when you're not blessed with any opportunities to get married, you end up thinking about lots of stuff. Like, 'What's marriage about?'. Or, 'What's falling for someone about?'. You see, whenever my parents come to my house, they'll say, 'My, there's so much tableware even though you live by yourself'. I just happen to buy a lot of it because I come home tired and don't wash the dishes for days. It's not for someone else. What's the point of getting married when I'm living for my own sake...? I think... and think..."</p>
<p class="null-p">--The point of being in a romantic relationship while I'm living for my own sake...</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can lead a life by myself, and my hobby is making perfumes, so I spend my free time secluded in my workshop. I get extremely happy when I pass by women around the city who wear my perfumes. I think I'd get even happier if I had a lover with me, but then the time I have for making perfumes would be reduced. I also think that, if so, it'd be reasonable to find a good person, get married and move in together. But can this be considered genuine love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">--Being accepting of others while moving on with your own life. This and pure-heartedness just aren't compatible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I... think you're a wonderful person. I want to try falling in love with you. But when... impurities like having to marry you break into it, I immediately end up finding it stale. Even though I asked you out as a prerequisite for marrying you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like. I. Said. Why are you telling me this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the slightly fed-up Cattleya, Chris raised both of his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the reason why I can't get married."</p>
<p class="null-p">With a troubled frown, he kneaded his shoulder,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I dream with romance often. If I'm going to be in a relationship, I want to do it with being in love as the only point to it. Same goes for getting married. I like you, so just not wanting you to be taken by somebody else is a good enough reason. But when it comes to marriage, the pros and cons get mixed up. I also get stumped when I see the profits that the other person would gain by pursuing me. Even when I do get to date someone, my strength runs out before we go all the way. Like, 'What, so this wasn't a genuine one either'... But, if it's with you... maybe even a straight-laced guy like me, who keeps thinking that love has to be done in a certain way, could age together almost as if we were friends... It's not like I don't want to fall in love. It's that it doesn't go right."</p>
<p class="null-p">While speaking, perhaps because it had become difficult for him, Chris rested a hand on his front bangs, hiding his face,</p>
<p class="null-p">"For friends, it doesn't matter much where you live or what you believe in, right? It's fun to be with each other, and being together just for that reason is what friends are about. I believe I can have this kind of relationship with you... I'm asking you out on the premise of getting married, so I've tried... to put it honestly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that weird?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's... not... weird."</p>
<p class="null-p">--It's not weird. It's not weird at all. "Even if... someone says it's weird, I won't."</p>
<p class="null-p">--No, I can't say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, she was the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Stupid woman.'</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a voice in her head. A voice that she was yet unable to forget resounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Cattleya.'</p>
<p class="null-p">He had only ever called her name a few times.</p>
<p class="null-p">'You, what're you doing by yourself? Aah? Old Man left you behind?'</p>
<p class="null-p">--If I'm going to be in a relationship, then let it be for the sole point of being in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">'He~y, we're getting complaints. Did you shake the client's hand too hard again?'</p>
<p class="null-p">--Because I like you.</p>
<p class="null-p">'Old Man! Why'd you let her drink!? It was a pain in the ass sending her home!'</p>
<p class="null-p">--Because I like you. Because I like you. Because I like you.</p>
<p class="null-p">The feeling of "I like you" rushed about, almost as a revolving lantern. Her feelings for Benedict Blue were like an electric current.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Why do I like him?</p>
<p class="null-p">They were impactful and vibrant.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The person in front of me is definitely better.</p>
<p class="null-p">The revelation was unlike any other.</p>
<p class="null-p">--But, I can't with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as if it had been thrown into her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Because love………... was not electricity-powered.</p>
<p class="null-p">--No matter what country you're in, love………...was not written with the verb "to do" but with "to fall".</p>
<p class="null-p">--If I still have someone I like, I can't be in a relationship out of self-interest.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one Cattleya had fallen for was not that person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mr. Chris... I... understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">She could tell why she was unable to fall for the man named Chris at that very moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand very, very well."</p>
<p class="null-p">She could tell why she should not jump into his life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I... understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">It went against the love rules of Cattleya Baudelaire. She was in love with Benedict Blue, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been having a bad feeling the whole time due to inflicting said rules.</p>
<p class="null-p">--It's... that idiot's fault.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had controlled herself as to forcefully stop being in</p>
<p class="null-p">love. She had made an effort to forget about it. Normally, she did not associate with her clients. Yet she had ended up thinking that she must do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because she did not have someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">One could not be in a relationship by oneself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I... get you, so it's definitely better... if we don't date each other..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, if she did not kick off the feeling of being in love, she would surely be stuck with that sentiment forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mr. Chris, you're just choosing someone who resembles yourself. I'm like that too. If I'm going to be in a relationship..."</p>
<p class="null-p">According to Cattleya Baudelaire's love rules...</p>
<p class="null-p">"...if I'm going to be in a relationship, I also only need the feeling of being in love!"</p>
<p class="null-p">...one should go after the other and confess.</p>
<p class="null-p">The people inside the restaurant quietly regarded the voices of the excited pair. They flickeringly turned their gazes toward the two, but as Cattleya sat down after having stood up with excessive vigor, each went back to their respective conversations.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dumbfounded, Chris opened his mouth,</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're telling me that now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tending to giggle, she replied after a moment,</p>
<p class="null-p">"You asked me out on the premise of marrying me, so I spoke honestly too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chris mushily ran his hands through his hair. He then said intermittently,</p>
<p class="null-p">"We might really be alike..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He let out a moan and fell prostrate onto the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think so. Besides, if we were friends, we'd probably get along super well. Seems like we'd get into arguments too, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because we're alike?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because we're alike!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps finding her bitter smile truly entertaining, Chris snorted and broke into laugher.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay, I'm the one who forcefully kept chasing you anyway..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He called the waiter after that. She thought that he was going to request the check for certain, yet he up and picked a strong drink from the menu. He invited Cattleya to drink something as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, is it okay if I drink too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. Rather, please don't go home. If you left now, it'd make things even harder. You dumped me the fastest out of the dates I've had until now, but the dessert hasn't come yet and I don't want to go home. I want to eat it together. It's tough for a guy who assumedly got dumped to eat a dessert for two all by himself. I'm a sweet tooth."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told so, Cattleya answered merrily,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too! But I haven't dumped you. Nothing even began."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed... it feels like it got cut off before it started."</p>
<p class="null-p">Oddly enough, the conversation they had afterward went smoothly somehow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Besides, instead of the beginning of a love that might end by the middle, Mr. Chris, isn't the beginning of a friendship where it kinda seems like we'll get along really well just what you need? In the end, rather than having fallen in love with me, you're just personally picking someone to somehow satisfy your own dreams and self-interests, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No... Well... yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Self-interest is really no good. Being in love is important."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like you, though, y'know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give up on me. I'm sure this would've turned out as not genuine too. Also, I actually have someone I like."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Cattleya said so, Chris finally worked the resolve to give up. And on top of that, he gave her harsh and open advice. Even though he had not become upset when being suddenly rejected, he lost his temper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, if you have a person you like, you shouldn't have accepted to go for a meal with me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm sorry. I wasn't getting myself too well..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So even if you'd gone out with me, you'd have broken up halfway, wouldn't you? That's rude to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm very sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please apologize more; I'm requesting a formal apology. I hate this kind of thing the most."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm very sorry. Next time, I will treat you to sweets. Would you go with me to Café Magnolia?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, that one-month-wait place?" His attitude abruptly mitigated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yesterday, I tried going with a friend and it was really good, and my friend and I finished a three-level cake stand!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'A three-level cake stand'..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You also get free seconds of black tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's tempting..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seriously, it feels like that sugar content deals you a physical blow, and it's the best. The shop itself is also wonderful. It's hard for a guy to go there by himself, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As both rid themselves of the part of them that was being cautious of the other, they indeed talked quite some. Chris could not deny the feeling of becoming thoroughly distressed, but was a gentleman until the very end.</p>
<p class="null-p">They ate the dessert, had an after-meal tea, and afterward, they passed by Chris's shop, where he created a perfume fitting of Cattleya from scratch. The shop had a good air to it, to the point she wanted all of the lined-up products. Perhaps she could have had a future working there, but the one who had crushed it was Cattleya herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Making arrangements regarding the next day they would meet, they parted ways by evening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Manager, did you get dumped again? Why'd you make friends with the girl that rejected you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the exchange between Chris and a clerk before the shop's door closed, Cattleya let slip a giggle.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">As the blue sky merged with the sunset, Cattleya was crossing a bridge said to be the oldest of Leiden.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having an extensive view of both the city and the sea, the place granted the best sight. Lovers were leaning onto each other's shoulders and enjoying the scenery from the bridge. There was also an elderly couple walking an old dog.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amongst them, Cattleya alone strode in high and proud spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Tomorrow, I'll give President Hodgins a notification of leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Walking with five-centimeter heels, her feet were making lighter footstep sounds than that morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Even if that guy makes a fuss, I'll ask him the reason why he didn't tell me about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt as if she had become unbound by anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I'll look for him, find him and tell him that I like him.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would not mind being rejected. That man was at least supposed to let her say it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like. You." as she tried mustering it out in a low voice, she became contented.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like. You." Drifting away from the people going past her, she was not embarrassed of talking to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like. You. Like... you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Only carriages and cars passed by her side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Benedict, I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her own shadow strolled with dance-like steps.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...like you'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were the only things supposed to be beside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, what're you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, a motorcycle riding right by her side entered her field of vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">Much like a mishmash of garbage, the motorcycle had a strange frame. It was not something from that continent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya moved her gaze lethargically.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slightly burned by the Sun, sandy-blond hair was visible. So were androgynous facial features. Except, they felt somewhat manlier than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah~... by the way, long time no see. Been doing well?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His voice was rough and a little peevish yet strong-willed, "I was going back just now. I thought it might be you and followed after, but..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya wordlessly stood bolt upright. Her face was completely red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What... was that... just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once she saw his shy expression as he scratched his cheek with a finger, she reached her limit. She forgot about her determination to go meet him and confess. Everything blew off and she broke into a run from the spot at full speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, hey! Hey, stupid woman!"</p>
<p class="null-p">--This is the worst, this is the worst, this is the worst!</p>
<p class="null-p">The five-centimeter heels had been the right choice. If she were with nine-centimeter ones, it would have been the death of her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">--What do I do?! Where should I kill myself?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Her head was deranging from the embarrassment. --Sh-Should I kill him? Would that be faster?</p>
<p class="null-p">She could hear the sounds of the motorcycle chasing her. Although she wanted to run faster, the cache-ccœur one-piece coiled around her body, making the wind resistance strenuous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was also no way that a human being could win against a motorcycle, and so it seemed her arm was going to be grabbed by the moment he overtook her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not wanting to be caught no matter what, Cattleya changed her course and headed to the bridge's handrail.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She threw away her clutch bag. She also took off her shoes. Without caring about her long legs showing from underneath the hem of her one-piece, she climbed onto the railing. Crouching, she turned toward him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll kill you if you come here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're the one who'll die!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was their first exchange upon reuniting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being himself, Benedict also seemed to be losing composure, but spread out both of his arms as to accept her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Cattleya bit her lip.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Aah, how happy those arms would make me if this were a different situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now they were nothing but an obstacle hindering her suicide attempt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Calm down; quit trying to die and to kill me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya shook her head as though to say she was unwilling,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you hear what I said earlier?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, let's redo this. When I ask you if you heard it... tell me you didn't... please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Got it. Ask one more time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you hear what I said earlier?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the part where you said that you liked me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"GEEZ~~~~~~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He caught her as she flailed her arms. If she were an ordinary girl, he would have secured her and it would have ended there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're on."</p>
<p class="null-p">But Cattleya Baudelaire was not.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch, ouch-ow, ow, ow, ow!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let. Go. Of. Me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya was the physically stronger one. She bent the inner side of the arm that had been grasped and started striking with a twist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stupid woman! Stupidly strong woman!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know I am!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why're you running away?! I don't get it! You like..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't like you, I don't like you, I don't like you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it! Stop! I get it already! I'll leave it as that for now, so seriously, stop applying force for a bit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her movements ceased completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">As Benedict let go, Cattleya did not get off the railing but sat back down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't glare, don't glare."</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyes locked with Cattleya's teary ones. Benedict was finally able to look straight at the colleague that he had not seen in a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was dressed in a way that he could instantaneously tell she was off-duty. More adult-like than usual, she had her luster remarkably intensified. She was wearing a fragrance that had the scent of greenery, which had rubbed on her from Chris. It was obvious that she was back from a date.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whatever Benedict thought of it, he burst out laughing, "Hahah, you... I really don't understand you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, I get it already. Let's talk in peace for a bit. How was</p>
<p class="null-p">the company while I was out? Weren't there any weird incidents or something? How're Old Man and V?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya replied with puckered lips,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really. Everyone's doing fine. President Hodgins and Violet, too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm doing fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so? I think you got thinner, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">As she had actually lost weight, Cattleya was surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey~, were you lonely, even if just a little?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y'know, not even a wild animal would glare like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I definitely don't wanna tell the guy who didn't say anything to me that I was lonely!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She attempted to kick him with a bare foot, yet she swung and missed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict climbed onto the railing and sat on it as though to line up with Cattleya.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Smells of earth.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could sense the scent of him, which changed depending on the day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I ended up coming back 'cause I was lonely," Benedict whispered with a falsely energetic voice. "I went looking for someone for a bit. But I seriously have no clues so I really just went in circles. I also used most of the money I'd earned from the company and now I nearly haven't got a single penny. Even it's a continent that I used to live in, I've got next to no acquaintances over there... so I ki~nda started thinking that I wanted to hurry back home and stuff like that..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having never seen that side of his, Cattleya was in a trance, forgetting to close her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, even though the places I went to weren't any good, I was able to gather a little info, so I'm thinking of going there again when I save up more money. Well, it's also a mystery whether or not she's in that continent in the first place..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's my little sister. I'm looking for her. By the way, say something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You had a little sister?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, I did. I definitely did."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did she run away from home? I did too, though..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's more like we lived separated. You, is it okay for you not to go back? Your parents must be worried."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible. I'm me, so... it's hard. Enough of my matters. So, are you returning to the company?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I don't have any other place to go back to."</p>
<p class="null-p">--I see, Cattleya thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict would return. That alone made her incredibly happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so? Saves the trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was truly glad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving aside the fact she was currently in an embarrassing situation, she was honestly happy for just that much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Welcome home," she wound up saying, smiling naturally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't go away all of a sudden anymore, 'kay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">--I like you, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps that feeling of hers...</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Cause I was about to try looking for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">...had seeped out.</p>
<p class="null-p">A slightly strong wind gusted, her long dark hair getting on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've ended up unfolding a foolish-looking escape number, but isn't it about time to get off the handrail?" suggested the serenity of the cold wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey." She was about to say, "Shall we get off?" but saw him raising his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Beyond it, she also saw a face that she had never witnessed from Benedict.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her dark hair was caught in his fingertips. While pushing its way through, his approaching palm drew near her. It was not even a second later that their faces connected with one another.</p>
<p class="null-p">--His hand is moving, but...</p>
<p class="null-p">She could not bring herself to flee, push him away or anything of the sort. As their faces rubbed onto each other's, she sensed something wet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than the feeling of "Why are you doing something like this?", what she thought about was, "Why are you crying?".</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I disappeared... would you look for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His face had distanced from hers, but the hand that had come close to her cheek firmly reached out to her back and she became incapable of running off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, would you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His rough and slightly peevish, yet strong-willed voice had changed into one that sounded as if he were so lonesome that he had become unable to endure it and was holding back from sobbing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Took me three months to work up the resolve for it, but if this ever happens again, I'll go look for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict Blue's three-month journey might have been something far more arduous than she had thought, Cattleya finally perceived.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was truly so, so lonely. Thus, he came back to the city that had already become his homeland and to the people in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you didn't know where I'd go to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For the time being, she would leave aside what he had done to her. It might have been trouble for her, but she did not take it as cruelty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're an idiot, so I think you'd definitely leave clues somewhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, it was certain that she should listen to what he had to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-What if I ‐ what if, y'know ‐ were living life having forgotten about you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I'd cry..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd cry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would. Like normal. But if I could bring you back, I'd do it. I mean, the President would be sad too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I... wonder if he misses me. He was making an okay face when sending me off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"One more cactus appeared in President's room while you were gone, and that's 'cause he named it Benedict. He's lonely enough that he seems about to buy himself a dog with the name Benedict or something one of these days."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't lie..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not a lie. Let's go to the company now. There's a cactus on his desk, I tell you. Everyone's seen him going, 'Benedict, grow on' when watering it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuku. That's a lie, ain't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, c'mon. Let's go. I was thinking of going home, but since you're here, I wanna go to the office."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hn~, just a bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">The strength of the arm that was holding Cattleya became even firmer.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she thought of shaking it off, she would be able to, but by the looks of it, she would turn into just a girl when she was in front of that man. She wondered if she still had a piece of her mind to give about him doing such things to her. She did not, but even if she had, she would want to kill it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Well, I guess... that can be after this heat cools down a tad more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya herself also wanted to stay like that a bit longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said 'welcome home'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't 'yeah' me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well done."</p>
<p class="null-p">--If I'm going to be in a relationship, let it be with liking you as the only reason for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, you know, I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">That alone was good enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">--If it's not just for that, I don't want it.</p>

<p class="null-h1">Chapter 05: Claudia Hodgins and Gilbert Bougainvillea</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Military School of Leidenschaftlich's Army does not inquire people's social ranks. The gates are open to all youths, and anyone at least fourteen years old can devote themselves to it regardless of their gender. National defense means protecting everything you love."</p>
<p class="null-p">Where had I seen a bulletin with these contents again?</p>
<p class="null-p">If I was certain, it had been in front of our business partner wholesale store, when I entered and exited it on an errand for my family. One particular sheet had been standing out on a board where the townsfolk stuck anything they felt like, from job hunts to searches for people.</p>
<p class="null-p">While biting into an apple that I had received from the store's owner as recompense for the errand, my thirteenyear-old self had gazed at it intently. It was a good-quality paper rendered perfectly straight, firmly nailed by thumbtacks in all four corners. Pushed into the paper at the end of the text was a gold screw, as well as red sealing wax, bearing the emblem of Leidenschaftlich's army.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a child, I had thought that was a pretty cool life choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">How stupid.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even I would want to laugh at myself for being so naive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, I had not yet come to know the meaning of granting and taking away lives.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, once I tried becoming a soldier, reality ended up crushing many delusions of mine, but that's a tale for later.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's go back to my current story.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were many reasons why I had decided that, "yeah, I'll become a soldier".</p>
<p class="null-p">One was that I'm the second son of a merchant household, and since my older brother was the one who would take over the inheritances, I wasn't needed there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Another one was that, as I had been raised in a big family, I wanted to hurry and become independent so that I could have my own space.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet another was that the name my parents had given me was "Claudia", which had made me think of wishing to become manly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lastly, well... my older brother's fiancée was a beautiful woman just my type, so I had wanted to keep a distance from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The most important was that I desired to protect the family I loved but wanted to depart from, I guess.</p>
<p class="null-p">The war had been progressively intensifying back then. A resources conflict between North and South. It was that one messy Continental War of a few years ago, where a religious confrontation between the West and the East became involved.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leidenschaftlich was the continent's southernmost extremity. If we had been attacked at that point, our defeat would have been certain and my family would likely have lost their lives. Because I was fond of my town and my people, and because I was fond of Leidenschaftlich, enlisting had been an inclination from my spontaneous feelings. The many things that had happened to me at the time boosted them... and so, I decided to become a soldier.</p>
<p class="null-p">I applied without telling my parents, and as for the entrance exam, I took it after lying that I was going to hang out with friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">When a letter of acceptance was suddenly delivered by a postman to my home, my Pops beat the hell out of me. I hit him back, though. Pops was surprised at that. So was I. Like, "Pops is surprisingly weak.". During childhood, people think that their guardians are damn huge existences...</p>
<p class="null-p">Yup. My parents had probably been worried. Choosing soldier as profession earns you a higher mortality rate than from leading a normal life.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the Military School, all officers living inside the dorms was something enforced, so no one had a choice but let go of their parents. Still, I was stubborn, so I took a photo of my family with me as I left.</p>
<p class="null-p">Two years after that, I guess, was when it happened. I met Gilbert.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Do you know the true meaning of that flowering tree's name?</p>
<p class="null-p">They bloom every year. They're planted all over the country as roadside trees, and when spring comes, lovely white buds sprout on them. When the petals fall, they form a pure-white carpet that never melts away.</p>
<p class="null-p">During that time, the colors of the city disappear like in a snowy country. People who go abroad have their mouths agape when coming back. You don't see that sight anywhere else. No matter where I go, I remember that scenery whenever spring comes about.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's like an extraordinarily fine woman that you get to spend only a single night with. If you listened to the music playing while the two of you were sleeping together, you'd remember her. Just like that, I'd reminisce to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever spring arrives, my memories summon the past along with the white of those flowers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gem-like emerald-green eyes hidden under a deeply burrowed military cap. Lifeless fingertips from pale hands that would not move after reaching out to the person walking away on him. Whispered words not conveyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'd recall over and over again the Gilbert Bougainvillea of that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert... Gilbert Bougainvillea.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right, I started this story in order to talk about him. I spoke too much about myself. Let's discuss him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bougainvillea. A clan named after a flower. If you live in this country and ask about the Bougainvillea family name, you'd know that it's a famous family of military descent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Didn't you know? Statues and things like that of his ancestors are all over the city. After all, Leidenschaftlich has a history of having fought other nations that attacked and invaded it since the distant past.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's easy for brilliant soldiers to be treated like legendary existences. It went to the point where it could be said that a soldier come from the Bougainvillea family was someone sure to take up employment. Even at present, this hasn't changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">He's the young master of a well-off house. Actually, his bloodline is a high-class one. It also had matrimonial ties with the royal family of the monarchy period from before the country was administered by the military. The royal family is used as a symbol nowadays, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">If times were better, he's a person who we would not be allowed to talk about so casually. Yup, right on. This is why you exist now. They have that much power.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why I became friends with Gilbert, you ask? It all began in early spring at the Military Service School of Leidenschaftlich.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Military School was located near the national border. So that it could become a shield at the very front in case something happened, you see. The way it started from an allseeing tower surrounded by a sturdy fort was just like a fortress city. If you went inside, you'd be sandwiched by narrow stone walls in a pathway that went on for long, and after passing through it, you'd finally be able to get out at the square.</p>
<p class="null-p">The city of Leiden was made like that too, right? If there</p>
<p class="null-p">was an attack, we'd defend it at the entrance, and then engage in confront at an open space.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did you know that there's a height limit to the buildings of Leiden? Most buildings were erected to the same height. But public institutions built inside the country were pretty big. Yup, that's right. High-rise buildings were intentionally constructed in fixed intervals. For the sake of long-distance snipers. That's the kind of country we live in.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing it that way, you might imagine it as some ostentatious building, but it'd turn into a beautiful thing when spring came. The roadside trees in our country will bud with white flowers every year, right? Yes, that kind. Strangely enough, its name is "bougainvillea".</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know why his household has that surname, but surely it's got something to do with the fact that those vines were planted all over the country.</p>
<p class="null-p">The completely white carpet that can be made out of those tiny flowers falling little by little is a gentle beauty. That sight is enough to be sometimes praised as the "residence of angel feathers". Those vines surrounded the Military School in rows.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few years after having enrolled into it, my hobby was going on idle strolls during that time of the year, so I was taking a walk. I got greeted by a passing freshman. "The place you're about to enter is hell~," I thought to myself while greeting back with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was warm and pleasant under the lively sunlight, and just as it was about to melt the insides of my head, I found an eye-opening person.</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of person was it? He was a beauty. Yep, he was... the kind of beauty that you don't see around so often.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was about as lengthy as yours. His long black hair formed a lenient curve and his eyes were a deep green. He had handsome facial features that gave off an androgynous impression, but the long limbs that he was gifted with and his well-trained body looked pretty cool in the white naval uniform he was dressed in.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what people would say. He was the kind of man that other men would fall for on sight, so to speak. That was the kind of person he was.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was arguing with someone. As the two were side-byside, I could soon tell they were siblings. The big discrepancy was that the boy who was presumably the younger brother was the one with a more awe-inspiring look. The two had not noticed that a passerby like me was walking their way.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was weird for a guy wearing a naval uniform to be in front of the army's Military School in the first place. They piqued my interest, so I couldn't help standing there to eavesdrop. I could hear what they were talking about in bits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Brother, you're selfish."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's for your sake; understand it, Gil."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you never tell me anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then cut off our ties as brothers."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All I ever do is say yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">When the younger brother said so, I got sad and felt like siding with him. I was at loss, so I stayed as a spectator.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while, the two stopped yelling at each other, and the older brother deliberately took off the military cap that the younger one was wearing, reached a hand toward his head and patted it messily.</p>
<p class="null-p">The younger brother was making a face that seemed like he was frustrated from the bottom of his heart. As if to hide that face, the older brother buried the cap deep onto the other's head, turned his back to him and left. He didn't even turn to look at the younger brother, who was probably crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt bad for the boy and tried to go talk to him. But when I saw him raising his lowered head, I stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if none of the emotions that were there until just then had ever existed, his expression became cold and he went through the gates of the Military School.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the first instant I saw Gilbert. I had never seen a boy make a face like that before, so I just continued staring at his back as if I had grown senile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It became the topic that a son of the family of national heroes had enrolled as the top student among the freshmen that year. I had skipped the freshmen's entrance ceremony and didn't see anything, so I had no idea, but thinking back about it now, that was him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite all of us being fellow students, we didn't get to interact with each other if our school years were different. Even if we had joined training, it was impossible to make a distinction since it was just men. What caused the occasion for us to properly meet face-to-face was a small incident.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The ratio of enrollment in the Army Service School of Leidenschaftlich was of seven men to every three women.</p>
<p class="null-p">The women's duties were normally of telegraph soldiers or replenishment troops, so our curriculums were different, and of course, our dorms were separate too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our curriculum? Running, running, running. Building muscle. Firing guns, firing, firing, running, running, running. A repetition of that. The rest was classroom lectures. We'd learn how to form strategies, set up camps and use communication equipment. There were also the subjects learned at ordinary schools like normal. The girls had it easier than us, but it didn't change that it was hard for everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Guys and girls who devoted themselves to national defense day and night getting into relationships away from the eyes of our demon-like instructors was something, well, natural.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, we didn't have any other form of amusement. Romance was an amusement.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'd also played around with countless people myself, but I never had a love that went as far as making my body burn. In that point, I'm sure I might've never had a true love. I never stuck to only one person. I like all women, so loving just one feels weird.</p>
<p class="null-p">No biggie for me. Romance was a diversion anyhow. But diversions can cause some pretty dangerous stuff to follow you around. There were times when it was just pleasure for me but the other person was betting their life on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe due to that attitude of mine being the one to blame, one of the girls I had fooled around with pushed a letter of challenge onto me.</p>
<p class="null-p">A letter of challenge. Do you know them? Letters with contents like, "I hate you very much", "I'll send you flying", "Be here on X day of X month". That's right. There are letters like those in the world too.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed she was going out with me with the intention of getting married. I had no idea. No, really. I didn't even lay a hand on her, y'know? Did we ever go as far as kissing? I'm serious, I tell you. Kissing is a greeting to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've got no choice but to apologize wholeheartedly for this in my own way."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as I thought so, when I went to the place I had been called over to, there he was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who?</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert Bougainvillea.</p>
<p class="null-p">That boy I had seen on the day of the entrance ceremony, standing fleetingly in the middle of those white flowers with his head hanging down, was there. From the very start, he had been piercing me with a scornful emerald-green gaze as I walked over. He was fourteen, I was sixteen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you Claudia Hodgins?" was the first thing he said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like his face, his voice was gallant. At fourteen years of age, Gilbert somewhat gave off the feeling of a small adult. His black hair was settled down in a way that not a single thread would dishevel.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had dignified facial traits even though he was young. From his voice tone to his gestures, the man named Gilbert Bougainvillea was already pre-made. He had come from a family of soldiers, so from his point of view, maybe the Military School was just an extension of his home.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surrounded by trees under the shadow of the school building, those training barracks were a place that didn't have any popularity, but other than Gilbert, the girl who had sent me the letter of challenge and quite a number of onlookers were there too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say 'Claudia' ever again. If I get called by this name, it'll turn into a chronic toothache for me. And you are...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Gilbert Bougainvillea. I'm your junior, but in this situation, I'm in a position equal to yours as her representative in the duel that she requested. Therefore, I will be omitting honorifics and protect her dignity as just a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">I shall be your opponent in her stead."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was a kid with way of talking that quite reeked of seriousness, I thought. I was also a child with not too big a difference in age from him, but if a fourteen-year-old boy talked like that, you'd be surprised, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">More than anything, I was surprised at that fateful chance meeting. I had only seen him for a moment, but the Gilbert of that time and that scenery of white flowering trees had stayed seared into my heart, and he was a person remarkable enough to make you remember him unintentionally out of the blue.</p>
<p class="null-p">I beckoned him with a, "C'mere, c'mere." and whispered into his ear,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gilbert ‐ can I call you Gilbert? Why's an underclassman like you getting involved in the fight between me and that girl? Are you her new boyfriend and got mad after she told you about me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind being called Gilbert. You're wrong about that. I'm not her lover. I just happened to come across her when she was crying by coincidence, and after I heard about her circumstances, I was put in charge of representing her in the duel. I'm also not willing to fight an upperclassman... one that I don't hold a personal grudge against, to boot... but I have no choice. If she will be at ease with this, I mean. It seems you're a pretty terrible man."</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at the girl who was the source of that comedyrather-than-tragedy over Gilbert's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't have any memory of our relationship being anything other than drinking tea together a number of times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What'd she say I've done to her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The kind of indecent things that I can't say aloud at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was so embarrassed at being called "indecent" by that boy that I couldn't bear it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't do it; I definitely didn't do it. There're girls who've slept by my side, but I haven't slept with that one. We've dated. But I haven't laid a hand on her. I guess I've so much as kissed her on the cheek. But relatives do that too, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, why would she lie to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Cause she wants to catch my attention, doesn't she?" 'And probably yours too.' I added in my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If she tried to catch your attention with ill intent, it wouldn't be effective, would it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that statement, I felt the cleverness of the young Gilbert, but at the same time, I thought he was a child who still didn't know what the crudeness of the world was like.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gilbert, you've never gone out with a woman before, have you? There're two paths that guys and girls broken by love go through most of the times: to get attached or to hate each other. When one hates the other, they try to push the other down both social and materially."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though it's someone they fell for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's exactly because it's someone they fell for."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert furrowed his brows, looking troubled, and then turned his back to me, saying he was going to properly ask the girl once again about her story. He was a serious guy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I grabbed his arm and prevented him from doing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen, Gilbert-boy, this is a fight that you got involved in because of some boring sense of justice. Act out your role until the end. If you don't, you won't get to protect her dignity, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not 'boy'. Are you... okay with this? If what you said is true, you'd be accusing yourself of a wrongdoing that you didn't commit and fighting for no reason. And it'd mean that</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm being lied to and used by her. Seems so foolish..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With all due respect, Young Master, but there's a limit to how much of a goody-two-shoes you can be to accept being someone's duel representative in itself, and I think it's also a foolish action, y'know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems I'll have to shoot your words back at you as well and I'm sorry for that, but there's no way anyone could not listen to a lady's story if they saw her crying along the way... even if the result of it weren't something good."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert had whispered coldly with a bitter expression, but I mostly got a positive impression from that reply. He was a young man with a will that you'd rarely see in recent years.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took the hand of the arm that I had been holding and forcefully shook it. Perhaps because I swung it too broadly, his body rocked along with the swaying of the handshake.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I agree with that. What, so you're an appreciator too? A women praiser?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was merely educated like that by my parents."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was just a high-pedigree dog. I felt let down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so? Well, it's fine. Anyway, from your words just</p>
<p class="null-p">now, the points that our interests have in common became clear. What's important here isn't the face-saving of guys who got rounded up for a fight, but the feelings of a girl broken by love. She wants to feel better by giving me a blow, right? Why don't we do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're saying you'll lose on purpose?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I committed the sin of making a girl cry. I can do as much as let my face lie on the ground and get some mud on it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The shade of disdain in his eyes of a rare emerald-green color disappeared and I could see a bit of admiration sprout in them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the looks of it, I've misunderstood you. My deepest apologies for speaking impolitely to you, my senior."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem at all. We're the ones who got you involved in the conflict."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my first time in a duel like this and I don't know how it goes, so it'd be helpful if you could tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can hit each other however we see fit and I'll fall down after they watch us roll over, so twist my arm or something and end it there. I'll act in a way that the onlookers will know it's your win."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, do you know who those spectators are?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gambling customers I called over. I'll get twenty percent of the earnings from the leader of the gamblers, so it's half of that for you and me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I take back everything I said before. I'll knock you down."</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't understand very well why, but Gilbert started referring rudely to me and clearly ruined the mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, the gong of the fight resounded with a "clang, clang, clang".</p>
<p class="null-p">Having grown tired of waiting for us since we wouldn't stop talking, the boss of the gamblers played a battle-start tune with a pot and ladle. My relationship with Gilbert began originally from that fistfight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'd better regret starting this stupid wager."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert cursed upon me, letting go of the stand-up collar of his school uniform's jacket onto the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">We both measured a chance for the first blow. In contrast to me, who firmly kept my arms glued to my sides and balled my fists, Gilbert shook his arms as if adapting them.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐What? I've never seen this stance before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since my older brother and Pops used to throw fists with me and I to throw back by way of playing around, and since there was also a time when I would do nothing but get into fights in the city, that type of fistfight was part of my lifework. I was totally thinking that my opponent would come at me with Leidenschaftlich army-style martial arts. After all, he was the son of a family of soldiers. If you were to talk about martial arts learned by men who lived in Leiden, that was it. But Gilbert's stance was different.</p>
<p class="null-p">My principle in fights was to first observe the other's attitude with non-aggressive defense. Following that principle, I waited for my opponent's move. Yet it seemed that the same applied to Gilbert, so we just sluggishly watched each other's battle preparation.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the audience jeered at us to "hurry and start beating each other!", I clicked my tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">The performance was important for the gambling. Left without a choice, I struck him with a big kick after drawing my leg to behind my back as a test. He dodged once. I hit his tight the second time, but he acted as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">The third time, he grabbed my foot and knocked me down face-up just like that. He dealt me a series of consecutive straight punches to the stomach after dropping onto me. It wasn't a heavy attack, given that he was a boy who still weighted light, but it could make even my eight-pack abs scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">It'd be boring if I lost in that way, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking advantage of my flexibility, which had a favorable reputation with the girls, I squeezed his neck with my legs and twisted him upturned to the side. He was light, you see. Being light also means being astute.</p>
<p class="null-p">He escaped from my leg technique smooth and quickly. We both stood back up to readying ourselves once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hodgins, don't play around! We're betting on you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You two, don't get injured because of me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the spot! Do it, do it, do it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The spectators were loud, but even as I heard them, it all only came in from one ear and left from the other. That was because my senses of sight, smell and many others were directed at Gilbert Bougainvillea.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe having finished studying my way of fighting, Gilbert started actively hitting me. Of course, I also counterattacked and hit him back. Nothing to be proud of, but my fists are heavy and they hurt. An attack where I socked with all of the weight in my body, which was a congregation of muscles that I had polished, would usually cause my opponents to collapse after I hit them three times, but I didn't manage to settle it on him straight away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert had converted his battle style into one of simultaneous offense and defense. I hit him. While Gilbert covered with one hand, he at the same time shoved his other fist into my stomach. It wasn't just that his movements were agile. His fighting method was something you couldn't manage unless you had trained a lot. To top it off, even though that guy was getting hit, he had a face like he wasn't feeling a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gilbert, where'd you learn that stuff?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert sleekly avoided both my kick and my question, "Well, where was it again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐You really fourteen?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as those words had come up to my throat, Gilbert said, "Let's end this already."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert's fists suddenly became heavy. Annoyingly enough, it seemed he had been holding back until then. He came aiming accurately for my body's vitals with a calm expression ‐ so dirty of him. I became defensive-only and eventually fell on my ass.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert looked down at me from above with a face that said,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, lose just like you wanted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gilbert, you'd better review your attitude towards your elders."</p>
<p class="null-p">By then, I'd forgotten that I had to lose on purpose.</p>
<p class="null-p">I surrendered my body to the blood going up my head, raised it from my position of having collapsed onto the ground, placed my hands on the soil, and rammed his beautiful face hard with a lateral kick using as much strength as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was my favorite stunt. A tactic I didn't use for just anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who had rolled onto the ground now was Gilbert. I merrily mounted him and punched his body. Enveloped in a swirl of excitement, the onlookers rose in whispers. It was also a pleasure for me to hold down the guy that had been scorning at me until just a few seconds before.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, wait a minute. Stop judging me with those big eyes of yours! This is the past. A story about the past! Yep, yep, listen closely to the continuation, 'kay?</p>
<p class="null-p">While I became absorbed with self-satisfaction and beat the crap out of Gilbert, with no regard for appearances, Gilbert grabbed a handful of dirt from nearby and smacked it into my eyes. It also got in my mouth. Tasted of earth. I spat it together with saliva.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bastard, that was unfair!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell that to yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpected, quite unexpected. Apparently, he'd do anything to win. I thought he had seemed like a more scrupulous guy.</p>
<p class="null-p">He pushed me aside and made an escape, and after taking a large distance, he swiftly did an approach run and came back my way. What I could see with my field of vision clouded by the dirt were the shoe soles of his military boots.</p>
<p class="null-p">First of all, his right foot sent a blow to my chest, and as my body rotated midair, his left leg kicked for the second and third times, then his right leg attacked me again after I had rotated once. Having received three kicks in a row in the span of an instant, I collapsed onto my back.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐What kinda attack is this?!</p>
<p class="null-p">Above thinking of it as terrifying, irritating or anything like that, I honestly thought it was "cool". Nowadays, I know there are people of superhuman fighting races such as you and Benedict, so I wouldn't be too shocked if I were shown a feat like that. But back then, it was impactful for me. Yeah, it was impactful.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert Bougainvillea was to me a new type of human</p>
<p class="null-p">being who had suddenly revealed himself. His rotational kicks hadn't overwhelmed just my body. He took my heart too.</p>
<p class="null-p">What we did after that? Beat each other muddily without paying any mind to the observers. Tired of waiting for the outcome of the match, everyone gradually left.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed the girl who was the center of the whirlpool at that time had attempted playing tragic heroine at the beginning, but one of the onlookers came to talk to her midway, and she hit it off with him and vanished. The only ones watching in the end were a friend of mine who the head of the gamblers had trusted with the task and people with too much free time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, when are they gonna settle it?"</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">We didn't settle it.</p>
<p class="null-p">At last, it was decided that we were at a tie and both of us were sent to the infirmary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our fight was found out too, so the two of us had to take penal regulations on cordial terms with each other from our group of instructors. As to prioritize the medical treatment of our injuries, the disciplinary measures were the light punishment of ordering us clean up the bathrooms of every facility.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had done something bad to him. It would've been fine if I had just lost right away, yet I got serious... Well, he'd gotten serious too, so it wasn't just my fault in that point. No, I'm sorry. It was my fault.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a way, I apologized, but Gilbert said with a look of disdain that he never again wanted to be involved with me when we were cleaning the bathrooms. There was no helping that, since his brilliant school history, which had been about to start from there, ended up being tainted by the fight that he had with a senior as soon as he enrolled.</p>
<p class="null-p">We were of different ages and had different personalities too. The truth was that we were supposed to be alienated from each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">You're here now because this didn't happen.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since the fight had ended, I stalked Gilbert. Calling it "stalking" is heavy-handed, but thinking back about how I was at the time, no matter how you look at it, there's no way of wording it other than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gilbert, I'll treat you. See, as an apology for back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not necessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're reserved with others, huh. We both took the same punishment, right? No need for formal language. You using that at this stage of the game makes me feel itchy. I'll introduce you to a girl, then. What's your type? And the breast size?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm begging you, don't follow me."</p>
<p class="null-p">I'd invite him for meals despite his unwillingness, have</p>
<p class="null-p">him learn the taste of adulthood through alcohol that I had managed to get my hands on in secret, and occasionally bicker with him. I was also the one who taught him how to smoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know most of the general forms of amusement, so even when I taught him card games, the reactions he'd show were entertaining. Soon enough, the guys from my year that I hung out with started doting on him too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert was the type that older people got attached to. But what I'm talking about is a different way of showing affection. I mean, he wasn't affectionate. I guess the right way to put it is that he piqued my interest.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the get-go, I had been so, so interested in him that I couldn't help myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">About that, the same could be said of you. I'm not hitting on you, though. Huhu, not hitting on you.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was different from that... In retrospect, ours might've been a relationship where I did nothing but chase after him. He was kind of... a hard-to-figure person. Though he had a strong sense of justice, he was rather cold-blooded, and if he had a reason that compelled him to gain victory in a given situation even if through an unfair move, he'd do it just fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had a man-of-character side to him, but he was also self-interested and prideful. He had a charm that drew people to him, but he himself didn't have much interest in others. He was a man who only ever thought about how he'd tread the pure-white path towards his own future that had been laid out to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">I once asked what had been best out of the things that I taught him. "Smoking. It's not bad as a means of exchanging information." was what he said.</p>
<p class="null-p">I found out why he had turned out like that later on. It feels awkward to tell you about this, but it's an episode that can't be left out if we're talking about his past.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert Bougainvillea had a fiancée.</p>
<p class="null-p">He told me that when I was about to graduate. At the time, we were in a state where the two of us hanging out with each other was something that looked extremely normal to the people around us.</p>
<p class="null-p">What happened? Well, nothing. Just a repetition of the same stuff. I'd follow Gilbert around, tease him, give in most of the time, occasionally apologize to Gilbert... We became normal friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">The instructions had told me severely, "Don't pay mind to the Bougainvillea heir." and things like that, but I didn't listen to them. Gilbert had also seemed to warn me with a "don't get involved with me", but I didn't listen to him either.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that point, I wasn't a good kid. I probably knew him better than his buddies of the same age as him did. That's exactly why learning such new information when I was already going to graduate had been so shocking to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">He came to talk to me during a recess day in the Military School. Said he had a favor to ask.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to eat out with my fiancée right now... Can't</p>
<p class="null-p">you come too? We're in a slightly complicated situation, so I want to request the help of a third party."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go. Of course I'll go. Hah? Speaking of which, you up and got a fiancée behind my back? Since when? 'Since six years ago'? You‐How old were you back then? 'Ten'? Why didn't you tell me?! Could it be you've been going on dates with her or something during the holidays without me knowing? You have? Gilbert, you bastard!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I followed him while saying stuff like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">We properly took written permission to leave campus, making meticulous arrangements. Even though he had intended to take me along from the beginning, the part of earning consent was just like him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The meeting spot was a small café located halfway the road from the Military School to Leiden. I'd also gone there sometimes to have tea. The shop had a nice feeling to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, we met her there. Skip. All right, next topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eh? What kind of person was she, you ask? Hm~, I don't wanna talk about that. If I were forced to say it, she gave off the feeling of a Young Mistress from a fine household. Didn't seem like she went out... I really don't want to talk about her. Why...? Because I feel Gilbert would definitely get mad at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for why he had called me... just like he had said, they were in a slightly complicated situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the beginning, the fiancée wasn't Gilbert's. There's that older brother of his, and the brother was the one supposed to take over the family inheritances, but ‐ who knows what he was thinking ‐ he had enrolled into the navy's Military School as practically a runaway. That even though the men of their family are set to join the army.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since you're an ex-soldier, you know about it, right? Though both are national defense organs, there's this unseen ditch between the army and the navy. Like in the ratio of defense expenditures and stuff. It's an adults' problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah. Looks like the Big Bro didn't get along well with his family. I heard he had a spontaneous personality. With that, it was doubtlessly painful for him to have grown up in an authoritarian household. Thinking about it now, the man that had been with Gilbert when I first saw him had been that very brother. And the Big Bro had run away from home, so everything was pushed onto the ten-year-old Gilbert, because both his parents had decided he was going to be the family head and made Gilbert take over the fiancée too.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is rude to both of them, but they gave off a feeling of keeping a distance from each other. Unlike his brother, Gilbert was the kind of guy who wouldn't suffer if pressured to live as the role model of the Bougainvilleas... so everyone around him naturally chose to place their expectations on him instead of rectifying his brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that Gilbert was also cherishing the fiancée, in his own Gilbert way. But the fiancée had a wish, and Gilbert decided to fulfill it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eloping. The thing that men and women would do to oppose the flow of the world and escape from their status in the social ladder to satisfy their love.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not with Gilbert. You see, the fiancée... had tried to fall for Gilbert, but hadn't managed to. And then she fell for another guy. A butler from her house, she had said. It was romance, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Making him listen with ridiculous earnestness while his own fiancée confessed this to him and then going as far as requesting him to help her elope had been insensitive of her. But Gilbert had acknowledged it with a two-worded response and summoned me for an assistance plan.</p>
<p class="null-p">When listening to the story, I wondered if he actually had the function called emotions running inside his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to scold his fiancée. Like, "You go do as you please on your own", "Don't get Gilbert involved.". But Gilbert started studying escape routes into other countries with shit-eating seriousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The access from the border is monitored strictly. Hodgins, your home was a store that also deals with imported goods, right? Of course, it probably also has permission from the government to ship them. Couldn't you have them mixed in and get them out of the country? If it's possible, we could change the migration route to water transportation afterward... and avoid the conflict zones, no matter how much of a detour it is," he said, dispassionate and business-like.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How much can you spend? It's better for you to convert into money every possession that you can manage freely while there's time. This or you can make wheat into products of your preference... That won't be enough. It's uncertain whether you'll be able to set up a basis for your livelihood right away. I understand. I'll provide aid too. No, this much is just... There's the whole matter with my brother, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">The more level-headed Gilbert remained, the more rage bubbled up and erupted inside me.</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation that had my help as prerequisite came to an end. On the way back, I asked Gilbert if he didn't like her. If he didn't feel even just a little bit of sadness or irritation at those circumstances ‐ they had been engaged for several years, after all, no matter whether it was something that their parents had decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert, who had been walking silently, looked my way. The flowering trees that painted the roads white in early spring had lost their petals and were dyed green. Yet even though we were in a world with a different scenery, as expected, Gilbert was reflected in my eyes as a remarkably exceptional existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the corners of his lips curling up just a little, Gilbert said,</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fact that there's no meaning in chasing someone who's departing has been drilled into my body with my brother's case."</p>
<p class="null-p">Again, he was aloof. His mouth moved as if being made to speak borrowed words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't say I don't have empathy for her, but... if I were asked whether I have attachment, I don't. That person wasn't mine from the very start."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Yours', you say... You..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bad way of wording it, huh. It's not like I'm referring to her as a property because she's a woman or anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not it... You..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, so this is it, I thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Since it's you, you're always...</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt for the first time right then that I'd come in contact with the essence of the person named Gilbert Bougainvillea.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐That's why, even if you're surrounded by a big number of people, you're always...</p>
<p class="null-p">That guy didn't have a sense of attachment.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐No matter how much positivity you get or how praised you are...</p>
<p class="null-p">It's possible that his brother who had left was the one he had some sort of attachment towards. But even if it weren't just that, he was surely...</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐You look alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">...a person who had gotten used to giving up on things. That's why he treated all sorts of matters and people in a measured way. Even if his true intentions weren't so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To begin with, we've caused trouble for their daughter thanks to my brother. Doing this much is nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐But where do your feelings go?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Our parents will certainly have something to say about it, but mine will just match me with someone new to become my wife."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Aren't you disturbed by having the person that will accompany you for the rest of your life decided for you like a board game piece?</p>
<p class="null-p">"The eldest son of her household is the one who will take over the inheritances, so there'll be no problem for them other than their reputation. If they can continue being related to us through my generation, it'll be solved with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much Gilbert talked in order to convince me, I never said, "That's right.".</p>
<p class="null-p">The one by my side was a young man still in his teens. He was a child who, as a result of being demanded reasonability, didn't look for meaning in his own existence other than just as something "convenient" for people. He saw himself and others as nothing but assets.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was... happy that you had a fiancée, still. I did get pissed at you for hiding it from me, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, I was the one who'd gotten sad and my voice broke into falsetto because of suppressed tears. Gilbert asked what was wrong, but I deceived him by pretending to cough.</p>
<p class="null-p">You know, I had... seen Gilbert's future. No matter how much glory he achieved, or how long he walked through a brilliant path without deviating from it, there'd be hardly anything left in the palm of his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Throwing things and people away when he had no business with them and not caring if he himself were thrown away, he would merely continue treading the narrow, risky, pure-white path that had been laid out to him in a world of complete darkness. But he'd likely cross it in an extremely beautiful way, more skillfully than anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">What his hands were holding onto was already nothing but guns.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm a selfish person. Which is why I was simply sad at the truth that, even though I thought of Gilbert as my number one friend, it was probably not the same for him.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah, the eloping was a success.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have no idea where those two are or what they're doing now, but they trampled over my friend's dignity, so I hope they're happy. The aftermath was full of trouble, but the problem with the Bougainvillea heir's fiancée running away soon wiped out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert's Old Man had died all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as we pushed the rude lovebirds into my family's business truck and the two of us came back with nonchalant faces like, "My, my, it's over", an instructor called Gilbert to stop him, his facial expression altered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where have you been? What were you doing? We were looking for you. He passed away. You didn't make it to his last moments."</p>
<p class="null-p">The instructor must've been panicking too. He bombarded the stunned Gilbert with a hail of words mayhem.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert did get agitated, but not confused. He's the kind of guy who can cut off his emotions and do what he's supposed to do. He said he understood and immediately went back to his home.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wasn't allowed to accompany him, leaving the campus only with permission to go to the funeral. My relatives were mostly healthy people, so my first time attending someone's burial was the one of Gilbert's Old Man. As I nervously went to it, there he was before me, performing the role of chief mourner with a grounded appearance... Gilbert, who had become the head of the Bougainvilleas in both name and substance, was discreetly clearing his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why, if I knew this would happen, they wouldn't have had to elope... Now that their main obstacle is gone, I could have pulled out of it... I've done that person wrong." he said.</p>
<p class="null-p">He called his father an "obstacle".</p>
<p class="null-p">That was surely because of the way Gilbert had been raised, as a "tool" of the Bougainvillea family who would give continuation to the household. He had been treated in a way so that he'd live as a strategic arrangement for the prosperity of the clan. It had swerved him. People give back what others do to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">The closer you are to him, the better you understand. He's a kind-hearted but lonely guy. Even though he's got a cute face when he laughs, he hardly does so. He knows it's not something suitable of his role.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought that when I... when I... died... either this, or if I ever disappeared from before him... the only thing I didn't want was for him to treat me like an object. I couldn't take it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever the dices of fate rolled in his emerald-green eyes, he didn't see anything other than a windingly stretched future. He'd just earnestly stare at a path that wasn't the one of a human being.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was there ever gonna come a day that a man like him would chase after someone? Somebody ‐ anyone would do. Someone, someone. A person that he wouldn't be able not to be affectionate with.</p>
<p class="null-p">Would he ever get to have that?</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins cut the words short at that point, reaching out his hand. His fingertips touched the hair of Violet, who was tucked in her bed. He slowly ripped off a thread that had become sticky due to sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, President Hodgins, after you graduated... when... did you reunite with that person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon being requested a continuation of the story with long wheezy breaths typical of those whose bronchi were suffering, Hodgins gave a strained smile. He stood up from the chair he had been sitting on, placing the blanked that stopped at Violet's chest securely up to her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's continue this after you're cured from your cold." he whispered with utmost tenderness and a soft gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ends of his statement overflowed with an affection similar to paternity.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were inside a room large enough for two people to live in. It had light blue flowery wallpaper and a chandelier decorated with violas.</p>
<p class="null-p">On a round table sitting at the center of the room, there were boxes, bags and fruits baskets wrapped in ways that made clear they were get-well gifts. The interior of the bedroom was not too cold, yet wood burned in the fireplace, popping into sparks with a snap.</p>
<p class="null-p">The windows, which had its curtains closed, shook clatteringly due to the wind. The needles of the room's clock pointed an hour just before evening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This surprises even me. I wonder if it is because I have distanced myself from the battlefields... To think I would grow this weak. My apologies for not managing to keep control of my health."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What're you saying? The reason why you had a fever was that the difference in temperature got to you, right? The place you were commissioned to was a northernmost land, after all... Sorry for making you push yourself. Don't mind it and go to sleep, 'kay?" while speaking, he gently caressed the slightly dark circles under Violet's blue eyes with his index finger. It was not as if they would disappear with that at all, but it was a display of his wish for them to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're keeping in touch with the clients that booked you,</p>
<p class="null-p">and most of them want to rely on you even if you're late, so there weren't any cancellations to the requests. Don't worry about anything and take your time, Little Violet. You look pretty tired."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I shall cure myself soon. By tomorrow even."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No can do, no can do. Take at least three days to rest from work counting with today. 'Cause I'll come over after these three days to decide whether or not you'll be in condition to go back. Sorry for forbidding visits from the others."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it would be terrible if they caught this. President Hodgins, you too... My apologies for having you talk about so many things in addition to making you come here... I have caused you to stay too long."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine. If catching it would cure you, Little Violet, then I'd rather catch it. After all... I was something like your foster parent, though for a short while. Isn't that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">At that response, Hodgins smiled with his whole face,</p>
<p class="null-p">"The book that Little Lux asked me to give you is in the brown package. I ended up seeing the contents, and turns out it's a popular romance novel. If your eyes get tired, make sure to stop reading immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The rest is from the members of the company. Benedict told me to say 'take care'. Cattleya's scheduled to be back tomorrow, but even if she comes here on her own accord, you shouldn't keep her company."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell the people here at home if there's anything you want me to do. I'll leave work and rush over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Lux would cry, so please do your job."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins bid his farewells and attempted giving her a kiss on the cheek, but his lips were blocked by the palm of a hand burning with heat. As he asked with a sad voice if she did not want it, Violet replied that he could catch her cold, so it was dangerous.</p>
<p class="null-p">Intentionally making a noise, he kissed the palm covering his lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"G'night, Little Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good night, President Hodgins."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silently leaving the room, Hodgins walked through the broad corridor with a quick pace. On the way, he informed a passing servant of his intention to take his leave. His aspect of haste also showed after that in the way he drove his car.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because the residence he had visited was located away from the capital Leiden, the Sun was about to set when he arrived to the city. The madder red sky was gradually starting to envelop itself in dark colors.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the looks of it, today was a day of strong winds. Hodgins's classic car swayed unsteadily during the fearinspiring journey.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place Hodgins headed to was a lodging facilities district in a place a little out of the townscape of</p>
<p class="null-p">Leidenschaftlich's capital, Leiden. Inside it, there were not only the types of inn that one could stop by unexpectedly without reservations but also inns that one could not pass through the gates into the site unless an inviter let them. The kind of inn that he rang the bell of was exactly the latter.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first floor was the entrance for the residents, as well as the level of employees who carried out the administration of everything. There were five floors above it. Despite the singlestoried buildings being tall and three-floor ones being mainstream, the building could be considered quite a highrise amongst them. Only contractors could live in each floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a high-class one-floor-rent inn, where the bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, etc. had all been designed in a luxurious fashion. Even just a one-night stay required quite a sum. Incidentally, the residents were chosen ones.</p>
<p class="null-p">As he rang the bell of the top floor's apartment, there were footsteps from the inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who might it be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins grinned at the well-mannered words, "It's me. The little fox who saved you on that day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have a fox for acquaintance."</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice of the residence's owner suddenly grew lower as he recognized the other person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, the one who threw fists with you in our first meeting on that day, Hodgins."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait there. I'll open now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The chosen resident who opened the oak door with a gun at hand was a man past his twenties at the prime of his working life, as well as the head of a family that no one knew not of within Leidenschaftlich's army.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite it being the middle of the night, he was dressed in his military uniform. Only his collar was loose, unbuttoned at the neck. Perhaps due to him having no time to rest, his hair, usually combed down flatly over his forehead, lay disheveled and he had grown a stubble. He had also removed his eyepatch, displaying his lacerated eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How's Violet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins shrugged at the words said to him the instant their gazes met.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Hodgins, you've worked hard late into the night. Good evening.' ‐ Can't you ask after you tell me that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hodgins, you've worked hard late into the night. Good evening... I'm exhausted."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unable to bear the look that said, "Just tell me the situation already", he answered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just a cold. I told you not to worry, didn't I? If you're gonna visit her tomorrow, isn't it useless getting a report from me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was concerned..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because he had been reminiscing to the past, he felt that the current Gilbert had become quite amicable. To think that he, who used to be so prickly during his boyhood, now loved somebody.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins bit down a laughter that suddenly came out of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what was that? Why did you laugh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't. By the way, it seems so expensive here... Did you finish paying for the place you were living in a while ago?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm renting it for a cheap price thanks to my household's connections. I'm in the middle of looking for an apartment... so this is a temporary residence. I was... moving houses periodically so that Violet wouldn't find me before, but the need for that is gone..."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the train hijacking incident, Gilbert apologized to Hodgins and the Evergarden family, stopped hiding himself and continued interacting with Violet. The two were working things out with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">As one was a colonel of the army and one was a demanded Auto-Memories Doll, they had little time to meet. The moments and places where they could be alone with each other were valuable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, no wonder you wouldn't want to go back to the main residence where your honorable mother and sisters are." Gilbert nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to call her over there... Hodgins, you telling me about her situation directly has helped me out. Come in." He probably was truly tired. The words he uttered had frequent pauses.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins was let into the largest room. Perhaps because the lights inside said room were not properly lit, it was dark. Only a lamp sitting on a chest in a corner of the room illuminated the area around it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't open the window. The papers will fly."</p>
<p class="null-p">The desk in front of the chair that Hodgins silently sat on had an awl, binding rope and piled-up documents. There were also other things, such as sealing wax, a fountain pen and stationery left half-written. A heap of letters tied with rope lay next to the stationary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Showing a face of surprise, Hodgins quietly reached a hand toward the stationary. Gilbert had left him and gone to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="null-p">While reading the stationary, Hodgins asked with a placid expression, "Were you sleeping?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of a clock's corkscrew ensued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, until just a bit ago. Hodgins, I'm going to make dinner, but will you eat it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huun, you were pretty worn-out, huh. It's gonna be a feast. Gilbert, you gonna be having a drink while you cook?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A sweet scent had suddenly drifted towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not you... I'll put it in the food."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you do stuff like cooking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do it when my friend comes over at least."</p>
<p class="null-p">The eyes that had been reading stopped completely and Hodgins turned his head to the direction of the kitchen. Gilbert was not visible from that room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Liar. You're simply hungry 'cause you just woke up, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins spoke with a smile in his voice, yet he was by no means smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I'll eat all this by myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y'know, you've been calling me 'friend' out of the blue lately. What kinda service is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Lately'...? Is that so? But what other definition should I use? We've had this relationship for over a decade. Why is calling you my friend a service?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The words smoothly replied to him pierced his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I mean, you... treat nice people like tools. You don't show respect for me even though I'm older than you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"About the matters regarding Violet, I'm sorry. About not showing respect for you, why would I have to show respect due to age difference at this point?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hodgins?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite being called, Hodgins wordlessly returned his gaze to the letter for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was his first time reading one of those, but Hodgins knew about them. After all, whenever Hodgins visited his room, there would be a sealed letter with no addressee somewhere. Hodgins knew one more person who used to accumulate letters without sending them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're an idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Gilbert said, they had had that relationship for over a decade. They had also had a period of breaking contact. Within the letter that he was finally seeing again after those years, the feelings towards a certain girl that Gilbert had been unable to back from writing down were registered. He probably intended to throw away the old ones and hand over new responses.</p>
<p class="null-p">Written in them were his repeated apologies for what he had done until that point, as well as his words of gratitude thanking her for sending him countless letters.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins twisted his neck, observing Gilbert's back as he stood in the kitchen. The same was valid for him, but Hodgins thought that both of them had aged quite some.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐To think that those two who had parted ways would meet again.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a common love story, which seemed like it could happen anywhere. But that was precisely why...</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐...I think I want them to be happy enough to make up for their detours.</p>
<p class="null-p">He and she. Both of them were irreplaceable people for Hodgins.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gilbert."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back to the topic... Y'know, I believe that friendships can also be unrequited."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert did not negate the exorbitant statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins felt he was giving an empty answer without actually listening to the talk. His feeling of discontentment accidentally seeped into his manner of speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say 'yeah', but do you really get it? I think you don't... I've felt that way with you for many years. Gilbert, you can definitely make do without friends. But I'm not like that. Yet I really didn't want us to be like... like this, with me being the only one... who wishes for you to stay that way, doing fine. Or who wants to see you every now and then to talk about trivial stuff. Like, 'Is it just me who likes you?'... You're a cold one, after all. That's why I've been surprised with you lately. You...</p>
<p class="null-p">You probably don't get these feelings of mine, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both knew of each other's temperament and comprehended that their friendship existed. They also certainly trusted one another. The proof of it was that Gilbert entrusted Hodgins with the person he was currently attempting to protect by putting his life at stake.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Hodgins nevertheless thought that, to Gilbert, he was not in the position that he had in mind. He had not once voiced it, for such attachments seemed foolish in male friendships.</p>
<p class="null-p">After having said that, Hodgins soon regretted it.</p>
<p class="null-p">He regretted it, and yet...</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I understand. I don't have any friends except for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because he had been holding the paper in his hands with force, it wrinkled a little. Hodgins desperately placed it on the desk and carefully stretched it. Still, he heard Gilbert's footsteps approaching while he was at it and returned the letter to its previous spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two remained silent once they faced each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe finally having noticed the half-written letter, he mixed it together with his documents and quickly cleared it away from Hodgins's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins followed the letter's trajectory from the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Upon sorting them out thoroughly, Gilbert exhaled a long breath that sounded like a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said I probably didn't get it, but even I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Little by little, his voice trailed off into silence, "You were always surrounded by a large number of companions. But you're my only friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐That's a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even without companions that he had a relationship of associating himself with in the way he did with Hodgins, Gilbert was already a person who attracted those around him. He was not the type to act like a lone wolf. He would attend the class reunions and socialization banquets during their days in the Military School. He could flawlessly hold a conversation with anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">But before Hodgins was able to deny it with words, Gilbert spoke,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have many acquaintances but you're my only true friend. After you graduated... I thought it would've been great if I'd been born two years earlier for my student days."</p>
<p class="null-p">His way of speaking seemed sulky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The illusion of a fourteen-year-old boy overlapped with the figure of a battered man in his thirties.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins felt that he himself had returned to when he was sixteen as well. Back then, he was always chasing after Gilbert and fooling around with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐We were always together.</p>
<p class="null-p">The pain that had pierced his chest gradually tinged with warmth. A smile crept in his egoistic heart, unable to help itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Gilbert, you...</p>
<p class="null-p">The man named Gilbert Bougainvillea was not the kind to say such things at all. Over a long time, he had become able to show a side of himself other than being an "asset" that served for smoothly administrating himself and his surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐That side of you is unfair.</p>
<p class="null-p">And strangely enough, the girl who Gilbert loved had also been a "tool" for his sake. Yet that "tool" was becoming able to gently undo the ropes firmly tied around her and show a humane face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just who had been the one responsible for the biggest part of those achievements?</p>
<p class="null-p">Claudia Hodgins, indifferent to his own deeds, merely rejoiced and smiled broadly at his friend's bashful face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hu‐Ahah, ahahahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't laugh. You made me say something embarrassing. As if I'll ever say that again in my life."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahah, no... you've got it wrong. It's not like I'm making fun of... Ah, Gilbert. Is the stuff you left in the oven okay? It's kinda making a weird noise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins stood up and followed Gilbert as he clatteringly returned to the kitchen. A familiar quarrel flowed comfortably throughout the apartment, turning into a nightly tune.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the same applied to time, no matter how much of it flowed. For two people who had a relation called friendship, it would go back to their bosom days regardless of there being a period where they had not seen each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Move over, I'm gonna sprinkle the seasoning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fool, you're mistaken, that's not salt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've got no spices at all. D'you live off just salt and sugar?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've had a long-standing habit of eating out. Hodgins, let's stop it already. This isn't food."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't spout nonsense. There's nothing that can't be recovered."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's so. Don't give up."</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how many hundreds, thousands of years they lived, the two would go back to the versions of themselves from that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">To the fourteen-year-old Gilbert and the sixteen-year-old Hodgins.</p>

<p class="null-h1">Chapter 06: The Postal Company and the Auto Memory Doll</p>
<p class="null-p">The current times were labeled as the era of postal business flood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within a continent that congregated small countries, the people who operated in the mail industry competed ruthlessly against one another. Putting it very simply, the situation of postal companies throughout the continent was of stealing each other's customers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Clients chose their mail agency of use and requested deliveries on their own. The reasons for the choices would be fees, deliverable areas, and of course, even the postmen's degree of courtesy was a subject of deliberation. Taking all of those into account, they would pick one postal company from somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">At present, as the management structure of postal corporations was becoming devoted to carrying the sidebusiness of amanuensis "Auto-Memories Dolls" rather than only delivering mailed items, others were unable to establish a position in the market if their work leaned towards the latter.</p>
<p class="null-p">The more the competition increased, the more obvious the differences in services would become, and, as the superior and inferior ones would grow evident, the losing side would inevitably close down their company.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within such harsh rivalry, in a certain country named Leidenschaftlich, located in the continent's southern coast, there was a postal agency so-called CH Postal Service had boomed its name throughout the industry. Although it was a newly introduced company that had but a few years since being founded, its reputation was exceptional. The degree of customer satisfaction was high, and there was abundance of re-users.</p>
<p class="null-p">On a general view, there were two motives behind its good results.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first one was that the CH Postal Service had no restrictions to its areas of delivery. Should a client desire, it would deliver to any part of the globe. Of course, fees were imposed for remote places, yet that was the first attempt in the industry of pulling such a feat. Even existing postal agencies disputing for a leading position in the industry had determined delivery areas.</p>
<p class="null-p">The CH Postal Service delivered even to regions of conflict, therefore being a great help for customers whose family members or lovers found themselves in battlegrounds. Its patrons increasing in numbers was something logical. However, succeeding in doing such a thing as though it were extremely natural was terribly difficult for ordinary companies. The CH Postal Service was in condition to go anywhere for a client's sake, as it had assembled the personnel and system capable of making it possible ‐ therefore, it had managed to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">The second reason was that there existed a top star in CH Postal Service, who had come into sight in the Auto-</p>
<p class="null-p">Memories Doll business like a comet. Seeing her walk around the city would cause people to do double takes at her looks, and hearing her voice would paint their cheeks red out of fascination. She was a perfect beauty that seemed to have come out of a mythological legend.</p>
<p class="null-p">As of late, a play that the famous dramatist Oscar had written using her image had been announced and gained popularity, making her renowned even outside of the industry as per synergy.</p>
<p class="null-p">People probably envisioned just what type of woman she was. Mostly, their expectations were betrayed in good ways. She was a woman that surpassed the categorical components of imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her name was Violet Evergarden.</p>
<p class="null-p">The largest trading place of the continent was a port that served as a gate from and to the sea. It was a national interest of Leidenschaftlich's, as well as a trigger for wars. Countless other countries had attempted to invade it, seeking its abundant resources and a privileged location.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the city was at financial ease with the prosperity of its economy, scars of old battles remained in some places. The symbols of long military service from the past had not been etched solely in protection walls or stone-paved roads. It could be said that the fountain built in the capital Leiden during the celebration of Leidenschaftlich's hundredth anniversary was its most well-known marking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Consisting of a total of nine goddess statues holding water vases on their shoulders, it worked in a way that groundwater poured out them. Despite it being a gem made by a nationally employed artist, the goddesses had their necks chopped off. It remained unfixed, for the sake of not letting anyone forget Leidenschaftlich's disgrace in authorizing the invasion of another country's castle town.</p>
<p class="null-p">In spite of being a major commercial nation, it was a military state. There were armed soldiers amidst the lively cityscapes even during times of peace.</p>
<p class="null-p">The members of the CH Postal Company had such country as their home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, what'cha doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It has been a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">Under a beautiful autumn sky, a group that rarely gathered met in front of the headless goddesses' fountain. They were two women and one man.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it isn't Cattleya and V. Have you come out to welcome the great me, unable to wait for my return?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving his motorcycle parked by the roadside and heartily eating grilled chicken was a postman clad in a glass-green shirt. His slender boots of cross-shaped heels gave out a devious sex appeal. Hidden behind sandy-blond hair, his light blue eyes were provocative. His unmanly, soft facial features were not gentle.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Benedict Blue, who worked at the CH Postal Company.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What're you saying? I'm gonna ask again: what're you saying? T-There's no way I'd come pick you up! I just went out shopping as an errand for my beloved President. Violet, say something too. To this platform shoes man. Nobody called for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who spoke as if to smooth things over with a moody voice was a beautiful woman of gracefully wavy dark hair. She had amethyst eyes and an hourglass shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">Brimming with enough sensuality to enslave the opposite sex, her body was enveloped in a carmine dress-coat with a waist ribbon, yet was about to burst out of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was Cattleya Baudelaire, who also worked at the CH Postal Company.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You two, you are being too loud out in the street."</p>
<p class="null-p">Reproaching the duo with a voice of silver bells was an elegantly beautiful girl dressed up like a porcelain doll. Said person had a hairband made of embroidery lace sitting on her hair as it spread out in waves and was wearing a one-piece with plenty of such lace sewn to it, along with a chiffon trench coat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"V."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was Violet Evergarden, the top Auto-Memories Doll of the CH Postal Company, whose blue eyes enthralled those who looked at them, as did the emerald-green brooch sitting on her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict and Cattleya turned toward Violet, changing the addressee of their impressions in unison.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, Violet, you're pretty fired-up. You're letting your hair down? Are you on a date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pressed on by the two, the Auto-Memories Doll that the CH Postal Company had pride in, Violet Evergarden, cast her gaze to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady Tiffany... someone from my home arranged everything, but is it that strange?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice sounded slightly embarrassed. Cattleya observed Violet with a gentle look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not strange. You're cute enough not to lose to me. Are you going to see the major?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It is still early for the meeting time, so I was going to buy a book for me to bring along."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's great; you're looking forward to it, huh! Hey, she doesn't look weird, right, Benedict?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya rejoiced without restraint.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tch."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict clicked his tongue. It had truly been a long while since the three of them had last gathered.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was only natural. At the CH Postal Company, everyone worked industriously every day. There were sporadic occasions in which they would be grouped on duty, but that was only when they managed to miraculously coordinate their schedules. They were mates who had been hired by their president at about the same time, so to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict threw away the bones of the meat he had just eaten onto the road, peeking at Violet's face while licking off the oil remaining on his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hu~n, well, isn't it fine? Nice work."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although their faces were close, Violet stared back at him with her huge orbs without bending backwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict flatly thrust a fingertip at her forehead inbetween one big eye and another,</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the one who gets to walk you around gotta be me. As your older brother part, I can't accept my little sister part getting eaten down by an old man. I'm better. 'Cause I'm young and cool."</p>
<p class="null-p">It could be said that someone who had the nerve to say such a thing so imposingly was quite a rare type even amongst humanity.</p>
<p class="null-p">With an aspect of irritation, Cattleya interjected,</p>
<p class="null-p">"A third party is gonna be telling you this, but Mr. Gilbert is super wonderful, is an adult man and I know Violet's headover-heels for him, so you're the one who's uncalled-for here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does 'head-over-heels' mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet immediately reacted to the term she was unused to hearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's like being obsessed. Didn't you say that the major was the only one for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did say that, indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her brows furrowed as if she were troubled, her blue eyes slightly moist. She was most likely "embarrassed". Perhaps becoming unable to say anything else, Violet wound up turning her face away.</p>
<p class="null-p">The feeling of affection for that awkward girl, the envy towards her happiness and the complicated emotions from having a friend taken away by a man traveled across Benedict and Cattleya's minds. Therefore, in order to dismiss it all, the two silently decided to ball their fists, pushing and kicking Violet left and right.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shit. Don't go acting cute. You're just a battlefield maniac."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, it pisses me off. You're as strong as a bear! But you're adorable."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps not feeling any pain, or perhaps trying to figure out how to deal with such a situation, she resigned quietly and accepted the unwarranted violence. As seen from the sidelines, it looked like something close to bullying, but Violet was actually the one with highest combat capacity amongst them. When the physical strength of the three was put together, that sort of thing was no more than playing around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen, don't let him touch you carelessly, all right? This is amazing, though. You're like a fluffy dog. Cattleya, you try touching too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, don't you go carelessly touching her with those</p>
<p class="null-p">hands either! Even the insolence of getting meat juices on a maiden's hair has a limit! Stop it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, ain't it? It's not like I just got outta the toilet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, does that mean... you never wash your hands!? Right?</p>
<p class="null-p">That's what it is, right? No waaay! Violet, hey, come here. Benedict, don't you get near us! It's my turf from beyond this point! I'll beat the hell out of you for territory violation if you come over!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Cattleya swung her legs, enveloped in Suède boots, to draw a line on the ground, Benedict opposed to it in a level as low as the next person, not losing to her. He picked a dead branch from the root of a roadside tree and did the same as she had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah~? Then I'll make everything beyond this point into my turf! Speaking of which, the way to your beloved president's head office is behind me, so don't you go back to it either!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah~, that's unfair! It's. Not. Fair!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not unfair~! You're the one who came up with it first~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a child-like action for members of society to take. Violet, the youngest one, regarded them with interest as if she were watching a dispute between animals of a new species.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a short-lived period of peace before an uproar occurred.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same moment, in the same country, within the same city, time flowed peacefully inside the head office of the CH Postal Company, nobody aware of the nightmare that would approach them a few minutes later.</p>
<p class="null-p">The business firm was erected in an alley away from the main street, projecting itself in the very sense of the word over rows of small shops. It consisted of a spire with a light green, dome-shaped roof and a weathercock on display, a deep green roof that spread out as if to surround said spire, and outer walls made of red bricks that had been sunburned into a tasteful color. The iron plate on the arch-shaped front gate made known the name of the company with letters printed in gold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should one open the door, a cheerful-sounding bell would announce the arrival of a customer. Upon coming in, one would soon find the counter, which was the sector where the reception of postal items took place. The building had three floors, with the first being the reception desk, the second being the office and the spire in the third one being the president's residence.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how far it was from the main street, the building was quite expensive. Its owner ‐ an individual referred by the members of the CH Postal Company as "President" and "Old Man" ‐ was drinking black tea with brandy at a balcony that had an unbroken view of the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so brilliant that it's scary."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was a lady-killer good-looking enough to display selfindulgent behavior. His age was around the thirties. He had droopy grayish blue eyes, red hair grown slightly long, a manly build, and although he was not young, he had soft facial traits that exuded sophisticated simplicity. His appearance seemed to earn the envy and jealousy from other men of the same generation as him. His leather boots shone lustrously without a single stain, polished perhaps out of obsession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"President Hodgins!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who had yelled into the room was a girl of innocent features. She was the possessor of velvety, evenly cut lavender-gray hair that stopped above her shoulders. She had large eyes, a small head and a petite body. It was still the physique of a young child, but the heterochromatic orbs from behind the glasses she wore bore a stunning suspiciousness that was mysterious even. She was a person who the word "lovely" fit perfectly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please say so after you've finished work!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, her conduct had presence as the secretary of a self-centered chairman.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins retorted mildly,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Little Lux, what I need right now isn't brutal working hours but relaxation time feeling the gentle autumn air and drinking tea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that with a nice voice, it sounds like nothing but running away from reality! Please; if you at least put the stamps, I'll bring you as many cups of tea as you want! Tomorrow is the deadline! We have to clear up most papers today and submit to the concerned parties in lots of places tomorrow! It's the Flying Letters all over again!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're already my Miss Secretary through and through. I'm so happy. You used to look like a scared little rabbit when you arrived here, but aren't you a fine working lady now? This feeling that I was the one who raised you is exceptional, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"President Hodgins! Please! Take the stamp! If you hold it,</p>
<p class="null-p">I can move you to stamping it... I'll also read out the documents to you..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, Little Lux, doesn't it make no difference if you're the one doing the stamping?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'd do it if I could! All that's left is the stuff that demands the president's confirmation, so just get on with it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That ordering tone with formal language coming from a teenage girl is giving me unbearable creeps... Hm, Little Lux, hey. You don't look bad with a shirt-blouse and a long flared skirt, but why don't you try changing your outfit? I think I'd recommend a black apron dress over a puffed sleeve shirt, black tights and red enamel shoes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please listen to what I say!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The figure that had once been worshiped as a demigoddess at the headquarters of a cultist organization was absent in Lux Sibyl ‐ what was there instead was the figure of a half-crying subordinate attempting to convince her vain superior.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had been working serious and untiringly ever since being brought over by Violet and hired into the CH Postal Company. Perhaps having incorporated a methodical personality, she was now entrusted with even the duty of president's secretary, yet she always had a hard time with said easygoing president.</p>
<p class="null-p">The competence that the man named Hodgins had for business was unquestionable, yet his self-amusement principles were extreme and he would not stop fooling around even when having piles of work to do. Keeping his day-by-day in check was Lux's role. In worse times, she would have to search for him and pick him up at brothels in redlight districts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you don't put the stamps, the one who will die isn't you, President, but myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was tired of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way. I'll put the stamps. I'll put them, I'll put them. Don't make such a depressed face. Little Lux, you're too pessimistic. Also, you take everything too literally. I told you that eighty percent of the things I say are random, right? Poise yourself more at ease. Let's enjoy everything. Even the troublesome stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"President... you seem like you'd say this even if you had a hole opened in your stomach... I'm jealous."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks. I'm the type that grows through getting compliments."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had wanted to convey something that was no compliment, yet it did not turn into words as Lux wound up having her attention stolen by something else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's golden and reddish heterochromatic eyes caught a strange thing in the skies against the beautiful cityscape that was visible from the balcony.</p>
<p class="null-p">"President Hodgins... Over there, something is..."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time as she spoke, Hodgins forcefully dragged Lux's body, held her up and jumped to the end of the room. Lux was squeezed tightly against Hodgins's chest, not allowed to even scream or raise her voice in confusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few seconds thereafter, the sound of an explosion ensued.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you not hear some sort of noise?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's leveled voice eventually came between Benedict and Cattleya, who were having a scuffle fight. Her blue orbs were looking up at the sky, sighting a black object that passed by in a flash.</p>
<p class="null-p">And it struck one of the classy buildings among the cityscape of Leiden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The head office is under attack!"</p>
<p class="null-p">No sooner than she said so, Violet bolted from the place. She slipped through people standing still with their mouths open, their attention taken away by the explosion sound that had reverberated through the idyllic early afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way, no way! Eeh?! What about the President!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get on, you idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict had mounted on his bike before long. After whispering lowly, he swung a hand around Cattleya's back, all too easily lifted her up, sat her on his knees and simultaneously turned on the engine, taking off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-! Doing that all of a sudden is scary! It's scaryyy!" Cattleya shouted, clinging to Benedict's neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Move! Move! Y'all are in the way!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A young woman who was selling flower bouquets with a mobile catering fell on the spot, the horse of her carriage letting out a neigh. Ignoring the situation of the traffic in the street, Benedict rampantly chased after Violet. He gradually got closer to her figure, which had already become the size of a bean grain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict stretched out his hand., "V!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet had been running at an astonishing speed, but upon hearing Benedict's voice, she nimbly hopped onto his motorcycle. The two of them, who had a mutual understanding without the invitation of "get on", exchanged words while paying no mind to the scandalized Cattleya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That sound was of Leidenschaftlich style artillery."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you see the cannonball's firing position?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no mistake that it came flying from the west side of the city. Look, smoke is coming out of the head office's third floor. If we suppose that it was shot from somewhere just as high, we can restrict the location, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It struck Old Man's apartment, so there's too many suspects."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How can you be so calm!? The President might've died!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya glared daggers at Benedict and Violet, yet the expressions that two had on were different from normal times. She quieted down without thinking. "No way we wouldn't be worried, right...!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict spoke even for Violet's part.</p>
<p class="null-p">The motorcycle that the three of them rode let out a roar while going up the slope.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Caught under a bookshelf, Hodgins was straddled over Lux with his hands so as not to squash her. Lux looked up at him, dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Little Lux, you can... you can take it slow, but sneak off from under me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The glass of the windows had shattered and scattered all over the place. The president's desk, which was an ordermade one designed by a master craftsman, had been smashed to fragments. The carpet had turned into ember and the room was starting to envelope in flames.</p>
<p class="null-p">"President Hodgins... I-I'm sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux crawled out, attempting to somehow lift the shelf with her powerless arms. However, it did not even budge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine, I'm fine. Man~, I'd been skipping push-ups lately so this is taking a toll on me... Heave-ho."</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant he put on strength and lifted the bookshelf all at once, he rolled away and escaped from being crushed. He was the bearer of a considerable muscle strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins stood up and looked around the room. The look in his eyes was no longer the earlier one of a slacker chairman.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry; you okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Only the gentleness in his voice was the same as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you apologizing, President?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Cause this was an attack aimed at me, no matter how you think of it. If anything happened to you, I wouldn't have any excuse to give your parents."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have parents."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Then, I wouldn't have any excuse to give you.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now, we gotta check if the other employees are all right..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyhow, let's go downstairs; we'll both burn to death if we stay like this!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Making a snap decision, Lux ran to the stairs that led to the lower floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Planning to go down through the balcony's emergency stairs, Hodgins desperately called out to her,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Little Lux! Wait up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, before Lux flew out the door, it opened automatically. Hodgins saw a brusque arm stretching before his eyes and taking ahold of Lux. She was dragged into the darkness and her frame disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Little Lux...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">By the moment that Lux reappeared before Hodgins, whose lips twitched, there was as a muzzle aimed at her temple. The one who pushed her forward while holding onto her shoulder was a man clad in a completely black suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">Six other men dressed the same way revealed themselves in succession. Hodgins's gaze gradually became grimmer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How do you do, Claudia Hodgins?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The man referred to Hodgins by the name that he made sure not to call himself by. It was the name his parents had come up with while convinced that he was going to be born a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Breaking into a distorted smile, Hodgins replied,</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're truly one refreshing shitface, Salvatore Ridaudo."</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore smiled sarcastically as well. His hair was fixed with balm to the point there was not a single disheveled thread. He was the possessor of wood-brown droopy eyes, thick lips and skin as pale as wax.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what is it you wanna do by shooting a cannonball into my office and thrusting a gun at my secretary?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, good job figuring out that it was our doing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have a rough idea of it, but can't you tell me... Mr.</p>
<p class="null-p">President of the Salvatore Postal Company? All that comes to me is that my academic background in the Military School was below yours."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How modest... What are you, an up-and-coming entrepreneur whose name everyone knows in the mail business nowadays, talking about? It's very obvious what I'm after, right? The Salvatore Postal Company and the CH Postal Company. Two agencies competing for deployment in</p>
<p class="null-p">Leidenschaftlich. The fact that the other party is a nuisance certainly applies to you too, but I'm the one who's been in this industry for the longest time. I can't contain my frustration. Your way of doing things is... Anyway, I want you to obediently come with us. I wish to have a talk at a quiet place. If you do that, we'll go home without inflicting a single injury on this cute lady and the rest of the employees."</p>
<p class="null-p">For someone running a postal firm, he was a disturbing individual. Calling him an underground chief would be more frankly agreeable. The men in all-black under his control did not seem to be respectful individuals either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Think you'll get to live in peace after doing something like this? The military police's coming over soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seems like you have contacts in the military, but I myself have strong connections too. The military police monitoring this area won't move an inch. I had them promise that they'd pretend not to hear anything the whole day, no matter how much noise we make. Claudia... Excuse me; is it okay to call you by your first name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins gritted his teeth to the point they let out a creak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go ahead. It's the name that my beloved parents gave me." "Then, Claudia. If we keep talking so leisurely, we'll both scorch. I want you to come along with us on your own feet." "Got it, I'll go over there. But leave my secretary here."</p>
<p class="null-p">At those words, Salvatore went blank.</p>
<p class="null-p">He cast his gaze at Lux, who ‐ perhaps from too much fear ‐ had tears naturally welling up in her eyes, and broke into a smile that was rather merciful for an enemy.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then suddenly punched her on the cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyes open wide, Hodgins's expression visibly dyed itself in rage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You...! You laid your hand on a woman!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A man from the back gave her support as she seemed about to fall to her knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">Side-glancing Hodgins as he shouted angrily, Salvatore wiped off the blood on his fist onto the sleeve of one of his subordinates' suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I loathe women who think things will somehow work out if they cry. Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">His voice sounded as though he had not an ounce of pangs of conscience.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time that the trio had arrived, the people of the neighboring shops were helping put the flames down together with the firefighters.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, Violet whispered quietly,</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is almost as if they knew there would be fire, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, just as she said, the fire department's performance was too well-executed. Thanks to it, only the third floor of the CH Postal Company received damage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You three! Over here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As they turned around upon being called, they found uniform-clad office workers of the CH Postal Company standing outside with burns showing and in a horrible state. A middle-aged man, presumably the oldest of that group, was waving his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anthony, everyone, you okay? What's all this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Anthony, the section manager of the reception desk at the CH Postal Company, had genteel facial features. He spoke with a demeanor and manner of talking that matched said features,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Every employee who attended work as of today is fine. However... the President and his secretary Lux have been taken away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way!" Cattleya let out a cry similar to a scream.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict looked at Violet. She blinked several times. Her long eyelashes swaying widely displayed "shock" amongst her scarce emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hand reached out to her brooch and gripped it tightly. "Who... and where... is the culprit...?" she asked in a low voice, still gripping it and not letting go, "Who... and... where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tone was an absolute zero.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was so low and cold it went to the point of making whoever listened to it hallucinate that their temperature had dropped for a second. The air about her was bizarre, further enhanced by her usual robotic aspect.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only one person moved within that freezing atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"V." echoed the affectionate nickname by which Benedict alone called her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet turned her head to the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay." That was a tone so gentle it was unimaginable coming from Benedict. "I'll do something about this no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words were almost like the ones that a true older brother would tell his younger sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's eyelashes once again flapped flutteringly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't. If we're doing something, we'll do it all together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Your plans for later gonna be okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The plans... No problem; Major will understand. Besides, Major would probably order me to rescue President Hodgins and Lux."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps unamused by Violet's attitude in demonstrating unwavering trust, Benedict ruffled her hair roughly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her feathery, wavy streaks expanded even more. Unlike earlier, Violet protested with a "please stop" using her normal voice. The instability that had given a glimpse of her former self as a girl soldier was concealed and everyone in the surroundings exhaled relieved sighs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, enough; I'm gonna ask about the rest. Anthony's troubled, ain't he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Having her shin kicked, Violet finally nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anthony resumed speaking,</p>
<p class="null-p">"The perpetrator is the Salvatore Postal Company. Its president who has the looks of a vampire and his followers dressed in black did this to the office... I tried to notify the military police with a detailed report of the circumstances, but they would not listen. It seems Salvatore has enormous support. I can't think of anything other than information manipulation."</p>
<p class="null-p">Meaning that Hodgins and Lux had been taken by Salvatore and their whereabouts were unknown. It would seem that the employees left behind were first and foremost concentrating themselves on digesting the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"When departing, President Hodgins told us, 'I leave the rest to you'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so glad! They're okay for now, huh!" Cattleya patted</p>
<p class="null-p">her own chest and welled up with tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Salvatore's the place that dispatches those postmen with black uniforms? If I'm not wrong, their head office was in Leiden, yeah? Those guys once went claiming a boundary to delivering territories, so I beat them into a pulp. Could it be... this was my fault?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what? The name sounds like a tongue-twist so I can't remember just by hearing it one time. Salva... Sal... Salfa..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Salvatore', Cattleya."</p>
<p class="null-p">Imitating Violet, who pronounced it slowly, Cattleya uttered it as well,</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Salvatore', 'Salvatore'... okay. Gotta be able to say it right. They're the ones we're knocking off into hell, after all. Well, when does the blood festival start? Of course, we'll settle the accounts, right? We'll go save the president and Lux, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a crude statement, yet the people present nodded at Cattleya's suggestion with an aspect that bore no sense of displacement whatsoever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please pummel them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict broke into a villainous smile at Anthony's request.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh. We'll do that. Old Man will be fine even on his own but we gotta save the midget."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict vigorously hit his own chest with his fist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anthony let out a breath of relief at that attitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You three, what should we do, then? Should we call over the other employees? The Salvatore Postal Company owns countless branch offices, even abroad. Is this all right?" Violet said after raising her hand,</p>
<p class="null-p">"We shall seize them simultaneously. In the national offices, there should be a spot by the windows with nothing but the reception desk. The three of us will take it over... However, the priority is to strike the head office first. Let us suppose that the location the two were kidnapped to is where the leader is. Depending on whether the people at work recruited as combatants are available, please notify them that we are seizing our neighbor agency, the Salvatore Postal Company. Hold a transmission for the combatant employees to grasp the entirety of the situation. We will entrust the information convergence... to you, Anthony."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood, Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was the expected of a former warrior. With that, the chain of command was made clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at Violet, Benedict asked,</p>
<p class="null-p">"V, ain't you kinda coming back to being a soldier?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet had on the same composed expression as always, yet the things she said were uncouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am not. However, counterattack for justifiable motives is permitted even during travels. We are merely going to resolve a quarrel between fellow post offices. The third floor is the one burning, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet had a reason for confirming that.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The trio stood in front of a thick iron door inserted unnaturally in the red brick wall at the back of the building. As Benedict squatted on the spot and dug up the ground, a small box covered in dirt appeared within not even a few minutes' time. Inside it was a bronze key. Once he reverently brought it into the keyhole, the door greeted the visitors while ringing out a rusty sound. They took a built-in lantern and went down the stairs in the thin darkness. Soon, they arrived to their destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">The basement illuminated by the faint light stored equipment that should not possibly be gathered in an ordinary company. They were firearms, swords, spears, axes, bows, shields and other fighting tools of all kinds. Even if that were the president's hobby, such assortment of goods was not something an amateur could attain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He saw something like this coming and was getting himself ready, huh. He's got actual self-awareness that people have a grudge against him." Benedict said as if in admiration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah~! President got the tonfa that I said I wanted! The whip too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"One fist's more than enough for you, ain't it? Don't go taking any more dangerous weapons other than that. V, what'cha picking? We got this opportunity so I'm gonna take the ones I've never used."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking around the hidden weapons of the CH Postal Company, Violet reached a hand out to something wrapped in a tattered rag set against the farthest wall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have decided that this will be my weapon. Benedict,</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet raised the object that was as tall as her with hand movements that did not allow one to perceive its weight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go as discreetly as possible."</p>
<p class="null-p">The three stared at each other in silence for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible, ain't it? I'm pissed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible, isn't it? With this group, that is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that is really the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">As the result of a discussion, they arrived at the conclusion that leaving the enemies half-dead without killing anyone was passable.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore Rinaudo stared down at Claudia Hodgins.</p>
<p class="null-p">The person he detested was currently on an imported bear leather carpet of his personal choice, feeble and with wrists tied.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were in a room encircled with black furnishings. The fact that said room was decorated with the personality of its owner was apparent one way or another. There were portraits of himself and bookshelves with double glass doors that did not seem to be opened often. There were also butterfly specimens and vases filled to the brim with fresh white flowers. Quiet violin music was playing from a gramophone, but it did not relieve the restless atmosphere in the slightest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having her cheek punched and swelled, Lux Sibyl was seated on a chair, but one of Salvatore's underlings had a gun thrust at her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was constantly concerned about the outdoors. From the balcony, she could see Hodgins's office at just the same height in the far distance. Black smoke rising from it, the structure of the CH Postal Company's headquarters and of that building were awfully similar.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was one more thing to note about the balcony. It was the artillery that seemed unlikely to have been placed there as an antique.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shall I tell you the reason why I despise you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He stretched his arm as though to embrace Lux, caressing her, who had her right cheek swollen, almost as though soothing a pet cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the cheek that had been hit still throbbed, Lux shuddered as if in pain upon the touch.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Above all, it's you yourself. You were born to a well-off merchant family, and used to belong to Leidenschaftlich's army. Even though you were promoted up to the rank of major, you quit the military immediately after the Great War ended and founded a post office next, succeeding splendidly at it. People like that do exist, huh? The kind that can carry out anything just fine no matter what they do. In most cases, they stomp over others' efforts with the sole of their shoes. And with a nonchalant face, to boot. I may have all this, but I'm one of the people who face hardships, so I detest those like you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If me being superior is a sin, then go complain to God."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My second reason for hating you is that you rebel against the principles and rules that our predecessors established. 'The CH Postal Company delivers to anywhere'? You make me sick."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins shot Salvatore's hand a blazing glare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"High quality at a low price for the costumers... That's the basics of business, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Won't you just crush those who can't do the same if you turn this into a standard?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You get tripped up because you sit on your hands like that. Y'know, I just happened to think back when I was a soldier that a post office like this would be great and am simply making it into a reality. Letters that can be sent to any sort of battlefield. Postmen who can deliver them. AutoMemories Dolls who can come to you if you so wish, even if you live at the heart of a sea of trees. What's so bad about doing something I like with my own money?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are still other bad things... What's that building?</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't it almost like claiming that you're going to replace the Salvatore Postal Company? The fact that only the weather face stands high up is also irritating."</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore's hand moved from her cheek to her silver hair, which emitted a glossy luster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't touch my secretary... Yeah, that's right, I declared war on you. I've known you before getting into the industry. You're all over the country I protected, doing stuff that doesn't favor it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, for example?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A bundle of hair picked by Salvatore's fingers flowed inbetween them, producing a smooth sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fact that you've been selling weapons behind the face of post office... You were selling national weaponry abroad, weren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We're a postal company that has gentleness and courtesy as our selling points, so we do deliver anything that people request. However, I don't recall delivering anything to the</p>
<p class="null-p">North."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not the issue. Even if you didn't sell anything to them when battles were going on, it takes just a bit of thinking to figure that this kind of stuff makes rounds, right? It was so unbearably weird... How come the enemy had weapons made in Leidenschaftlich? How come my comrades were getting shot by the enemy with them and dying...? I finally got to investigate that mystery after the war."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's had her hair forcefully pulled and her neck bent backwards. Her scarf was taken off, her collarbone peeking from underneath her blouse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore took the gun from his underling and pointed it at her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you know this much, you also know that part of my proceedings went to the military, don't you? It's not something that I alone wished for. Some people from your country, which you'd devoted your life to, merely wanted to increase their retirement pay a little. Isn't that a commonplace story? Can't you drop the moralist act? It disgusts me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm no moralist-hey... how many times do I have to tell you not to touch..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Claudia, it's not like you have a respectable life style either, is it? You wagered your whole fortune on war gambles and earned a large sum, wasn't that it? Funds gathered from gambling are a hotbed for underground organizations and black market groups. With those funds, they sell off weapons, drugs and abused women and children. Even if you're on the side that just milked it out, from the moment you placed a bet, you also made rounds and became someone's assailant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why I said... I'm no moralist! I did all of it because I wanted to. You and I are both pitch-black at heart. But y'know, my secretary over there is a respectable girl. Didn't you hear when I told you not to touch my secretary?! If you get anxious unless you're touching something, just hit me or whatever!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because such statements rubbed him the wrong way, Salvatore did as Hodgins proposed, leaving Lux and kicking Hodgins's face with his shin. Crimson hair swaying, Hodgins collapsed onto the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless, he grinned, "Thanks; should I take my clothes off while we're at it? It'd get you excited, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore grabbed Hodgins's collar with rage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How filthy. Your company is your human nature itself. I'm a victim. I want you to give me back the clients, routes and everything that you've stolen from me. I think being a soldier suited you better than being a businessman. Lying on the ground like this is fitting of you. Why... I'm just going to have you write your name on a document. Promise not to trespass my routes... It's hard to do stuff with you loitering around. Lots of stuff, you see."</p>
<p class="null-p">He let go abruptly, Hodgins's face banging onto the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"President!" Lux's tear-mixed voice leaked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins immediately raised his head and smiled at Lux. He went as far as winking at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore harshly told his underling to call over the official scrivener who would bear witness to their contract. He most likely intended to crush Hodgins's post office through leaving behind a legal document with unequal contents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tepid; you're tepid."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins's tongue licked off the blood dripping from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Compared to back in the battlefields, you really are dull..."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he coughed curt and subtly, his voice reached Salvatore,</p>
<p class="null-p">"My company isn't just mine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins looked out the window. He checked if something was coming and waited for it.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Salvatore Postal Company identified ahead." Violet whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict was driving his motorcycle, Cattleya behind him. Holding onto Cattleya's shoulders, Violet was standing on the edge of the passenger seat. Running through the cityscape in the early afternoon, the motorcycle carried not only three people but also uncovered armament.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey~, there's a huge tacky cannon in the balcony~."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All~ right, I was thinking about forcing our way through the front gate but change of plans. V, go off on that balcony."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict said with a lightheartedness that one would invite another to go shopping with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Cattleya, please give me support."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet took into her hands a thick, long cylindrical object that had been placed on the motorcycle's luggage carrier. It was something that could be called both a rifle and a rocket launcher. She rested it on her shoulder atop the running vehicle and determined her target.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Cattleya clung to her legs as to secure her body, Violet shot without mercy. Explosion sounds echoed throughout the city of Leiden for the second time that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impact confirmed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Pigeons fled into the sky, the townspeople darting their eyes about in search for the source of the noise. Meanwhile, the motorcycle that the trio was riding on gradually drew closer to the Salvatore head office.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/violet-evergarden/illustrations/violet-evergarden_vol_03_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Sca~ry! But ama~zing! I also wanna shoot tha~t!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya shouted in joy upon seeing the balcony destructed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Won't let ya no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You cannot no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict and Violet shook their heads in sync. Both comprehended that it would be dangerous to let such a naiv woman hold onto firearm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that~?! I also wanna go wild big time~! Isn't it okay?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let Cattleya be the first to charge in. Please be contented with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What're you deciding on your own? The first at anything's gotta be me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You follow me from behind. 'Cause the one who'll save our captive princess of a president is going to be me. A~hn, wait for me, President! Where are you!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You... As if such a huge dude could be a princess. What kinda princess is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you were as tall as the President, you wouldn't have to wear those heeled shoes, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong! That's not why I wear them! It's because they're cool! You... Imma make you cry later! I'm dropping by</p>
<p class="null-p">your place today, so get ready for it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo... Yo-Yo... You idiot! What're you saying in front of Violet?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Silently listening to the exchange between the two, Violet slowly took from the luggage carrier the handle of the weapon jutting out of the tattered cloth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I shall take this opportunity and go."</p>
<p class="null-p">They had no idea what opportunity she was taking, yet Violet nimbly jumped midair after saying nothing but that. As she landed on the ground, the motorcycle also stopped right in front of the head office with good timing upon scoring an ostentatious drift.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here I go, Major."</p>
<p class="null-p">The one taken into Violet's blue eyes was the Salvatore</p>
<p class="null-p">Postal Company ‐ a building that looked exactly like the CH Postal Company. Although it was a weekday, a "closed" sign hung on the door and five postmen clad in black frock coats stood by the entrance smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The stunning woman, the man mounted on a motorcycle and the beauty behind him appeared before their eyes. Ashes fell down in lieu of their surprise at the mystery trio.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-Who're you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While the men froze on the spot at her exposed unpainted face and moonlight-colored hair, Violet swiftly tore off the tattered cloth wrapped around the weapon in her hands. A battle-axe of a size unfit for swinging around in a city road revealed itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pleased to make your acquaintance. I am an AutoMemories Doll from the CH Postal Company; my name is</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet Evergarden."</p>
<p class="null-p">The name of the battle-axe wielded by that woman as ominously beautiful as a witch was Witchcraft. It had a silver blade, and the red rain that it dyed itself in from the number of people it had killed was a manifestation of its ill-omened existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Apologies for you are in the middle of work, but could you allow us upstairs? Ever since our company's president and secretary disappeared into your agency, we have not known of their whereabouts."</p>
<p class="null-p">As she held onto it, illuminated by the afternoon sunlight, her frame gave off quite a sense of misplacement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you will not listen to our request, we shall exercise brute force based on the guiding precepts of our company."</p>
<p class="null-p">But as she wielded it, her figure looked appropriate. Rather, it was the contrary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Raising the gigantic battle-axe blithely, Violet pointed the blade at the men. Instead of opening their mouths, the men took pistols out of their coats and pants and aimed them at Violet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The guys from the CH Postal Company are here! Don't let them pass no matter what!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet!" Cattleya's scream reverberated through the city roads.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the beautiful Auto-Memories Doll moved at the same time as the opponents readied themselves, dealing a preemptive strike in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Negotiations broken."</p>
<p class="null-p">A single blow from the battle-axe brushed away the postmen. It was an attack that did not cut them and merely struck their vitals using blunt weapon essentials, yet it caused three of the men to hit their heads against the outer wall of their company and collapse.</p>
<p class="null-p">The remaining two men, who had dodged the appearance and disappearance of the axe, frantically aimed at Violet and pulled the triggers. Without any change in her facial expression, Violet twisted the battle-axe around and repelled the bullets with its blade. Switching hands, she pointed the tip of the handle at the opponents. It produced a ringing noise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please forgive my rudeness."</p>
<p class="null-p">The flower bud ornament decorating the tip of the handle flew out together with a long chain. It knocked the two men's pistols off their hands. She did not give the men, who held their hands down due to the collision, any opening to straighten their postures.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, Violet rammed the battle-axe's arm against the surface of the building's wall and anchored it. While extending the chain and spinning midair, she dealt a flying kick to the face of one of them, made his face into her stepping stone and roundhouse-kicked the man next to him. There was no hesitation or mercy in her series of actions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bu-But I was supposed to be the first one!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indignant, Cattleya took a sack fastened to the luggage carrier, which contained her weapons. After thorough indecision between the tonfa, whip and other armory, the one she had chosen were iron knuckles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before anyone noticed, Benedict's hands were gripping two pistols. He disabled the safety catch with practiced hand movements.</p>
<p class="null-p">"V! Don't get too serious! If you're angry, I can get angry for you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if the people inside the Salvatore Postal Company had foreseen that someone would come raid it, postmen peeked out from the windows of the floors above with rifles in position. Bullets from Benedict's pistols pierced their arms as he spoke, creating a rain of blood splashes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If this is the emotion called wrath, I want to rid myself of it quickly. Cattleya."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet pointed with her finger at the rocket launcher that had no more remaining ammo to Cattleya, who had put on her iron knuckles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Agilely grabbing its handle with one hand, Cattleya threw it with heightened rotation speed after drawing it back once with much vigor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"One, two, the~re!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with her adorable shout, the rocket launcher struck the postmen who had turned up in the upstairs floor, breaking through the window glass. Its destructive power was the same as a bullet shell.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who had flung it jumped up and down on the spot as if delighted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyah~! I hit them~!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not a deed that an average person, let alone a young woman, could normally manage. She was the possessor of tremendously strong arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected of the Stupid Woman ‐ or more like the Stupidly Strong Woman."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up, Platform Shoes Man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ringing of the chain on Violet's battle-axe Witchcraft drowned out the duo's little quarrel. One of the men screamed and threw himself out the window, falling onto a flowerbed in front of the company.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict, Cattleya. By the looks of it, the President and Lux are unmistakably inside this building. President Hodgins told me that he imitated Salvatore's agency when our company's office was under construction. If that is the case, then the highest position is probably the uppermost floor ‐ the third floor. I am counting on you to follow the procedures."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two nodded in reply to Violet's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's kick their asses at once and go celebrate." "We're bothering the neighbors, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before anyone realized, the city had gone quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Salvatore Postal Company was located in a completely ordinary shopping street in the city of Leiden. However, the passersby had fled within a few minutes, and the shopkeepers of the nearby buildings, as well as the buildings next to those, had closed their shops' windows ‐ the so-called display windows ‐ and pulled down the iron shutters.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fast action stemmed from their understanding that the city had become involved in the maelstrom of a fight. It was a particularity of citizens from a country that had long been shutting off invaders ever since its foundation. The people were silently waiting for the conflict to end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, then, let's go in."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's figure as she gave the command with a clear voice was different from usual.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the chairman's room at the top floor of the Salvatore Postal Company, the scenery visible from the balcony ‐ an autumn sky where cirrocumulus clouds drifted high up and Leiden's cityscape ‐ had looked like it was inserted in a picture frame. Yet such beauty was something of a few seconds before, and now the artillery enshrined in it had received great damage from a sudden explosion attack, smoke rising from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once ornamented with delicate sculptures, the rails were crumbling, and the balcony was in a state where one could fall straight to the ground if they put a foot on it. If the artillery were loaded with ammo, it was most likely not the only thing that would have been destroyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that situation of settled chaos, Salvatore Rinaudo's pale face went even paler and his mouth fell open as he spaced out, while Claudia Hodgins bit the inside of his cheeks to kill off his own laughter and trembled in opposition.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What have they done?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahah-AHAHAHAHAH! Aah, I can't anymore! Can't hold back! This is the best!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins convulsed with laughter upon looking at Salvatore's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What you so surprised about, Salvatore? Isn't that what you did to us? Well, but... you wouldn't think we'd do the exact same thing as you, huh! There's no helping it!</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahahahah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Lux, who had all along been shaking with a darkened face, lit up with a sparkle of hope and laughed a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this the work of you people from the CH Postal Company?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who else is there? Our corporate philosophy is 'an eye for an eye'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins was in such a good mood that he seemed like he could break into song right then.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few of Salvatore's underlings went down to the floors below. Gunshots and screams soon echoed again. The fact that the screams had come from Salvatore's subordinates increased his anxiety and impatience.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They're doing this even though you might be injured...</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of training do you use on them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Basically a principle of liberalism. Most of the personnel I gathered back when I was building my company happen to be guys with nowhere to go that I coaxed and took in... Don't know if my preferences are biased, but it turned out that lots of them were absurdly strong fellows. The ones who're here right now are definitely two of the Auto-Memories Dolls that were off-duty and... probably a postman that was scheduled to return to town today. They're elite of the finest kind even among us. Salvatore, since it's you, weren't you supposed to investigate me through and through?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your company's employees are former soldiers and mercenaries, right? If that's the case, so are our postmen..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"They aren't just former soldiers and mercenaries.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict is an ex-mercenary who had the nickname of 'Battle-Hungry Freak' in another continent. Cattleya was a boxer. She has arms so strong that no one can beat her by using force. And that beautiful girl whose name you can even say everyone knows in the Auto-Memories Doll business... my adorable Little Violet, used to be Leidenschaftlich's most powerful female soldier. It's in the past, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins smiled at Lux, "By the way, my secretary is a former demigoddess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Leidenschaftlich's most powerful female soldier'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't your patrons tell you anything? Well, she was treated as a secret in a way, so it isn't impossible for civilians not to know about her. The military went as far as creating a troop just for her and made her work for them, but they never gave her recognition or ranks. She didn't have a surname back then and it seems people just called her 'Violet'. My friend found and raised her... She was the leading figure of the Great</p>
<p class="null-p">War in the shadows."</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore reminisced to the photos of Hodgins's employees whom he had made his underlings investigate.</p>
<p class="null-p">One that had been engraved in his mind remarkably vividly was a beautiful woman. She was a girl of exquisite, suave facial features. Even if one declared her to have been the strongest female soldier, nobody could believe it right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did you make a woman like that yours?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She's not mine." Hodgins smirked defiantly. "And she doesn't belong to the military anymore either. From the very start, she... Let's stop here; telling this story to you is a waste."</p>
<p class="null-p">The battle's tune gradually grew closer to the top floor. By the looks of it, the fuss was escalating to a direction where even angry yelling was ensuing. It seemed the owner of the voice was a young woman. Even amidst gunshots, the conversation between those two people did not cut short.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins's smirk deepened, Salvatore's face becoming grim.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You guys, give polite greetings when coming in."</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore's underlings readied their guns all at once. The tension reached its peak, everyone inside the room paying attention to the door. However, it was time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux, please cover your eyes."</p>
<p class="null-p">A beautiful voice that did not match such a place, which had converted into a battlefield, could be heard from behind the staff members.</p>
<p class="null-p">A black lump jumped from the balcony. It looked like a beast at first. A stunning and terrifying beast that moved its limbs gracefully and trampled over its enemies.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much the "hunters" who had taken notice of the beast's existence made bullets rain on it, its feet did not halt by a single inch as it bared its fangs. It steadfastly ascertained the battlefield even as it danced in the air, wielding its weapon with astonishing precision, bringing everyone to the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Aaaah!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The arm released from the battle-axe pierced and gouged the shoulder of the man who had been thrusting a gun at Lux. The beast swung the battle-axe and stationed Hodgins and Lux to behind itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore took a few steps back, and exactly two factions stood in position separated at his right and left sides.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Major Hodgins, we apologize for the wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm always telling you that it's 'President', aren't I, Little Violet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The beast ‐ rather, the woman ‐ shot a cold glance at the</p>
<p class="null-p">one that she perceived as the enemy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You-What are you?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore vented his confusion at the sudden intruder who held onto the completely red battle-axe.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had white and smooth skin like that of porcelain dolls. Her blue eyes were as glass balls. Her hair of gold seemed to waft with a sweet fragrance. The girl was beautiful to a rare extent, but that was not the only thing that made one's eyes widen at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">A living legend that Salvatore did not know was standing there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">The loveliness he had seen in the picture was concealed by a shadow, a turbulent atmosphere similar to madness surrounding her instead. An air of lethargic strategizing as to which of them would move first flowed by, but the stagnancy soon shattered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"PRESIDENT---! LUX--!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"OLD MAN!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Callings could be heard in unison from outside the room. The massive door was then broken through as if it were as thin a paper sheet. The one who stepped onto the door as it collapsed with a tremor and entered the room while holding by the collar an enemy that she had defeated with her silver iron knuckles was Cattleya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aa~hn! You two~! Found yoou!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She tossed the prey that she had nearly killed toward Salvatore and his group. Being able to fling a human being as if they were an object meant her arms were simply that great as blunt weapons.</p>
<p class="null-p">Following her, a gun barrel appeared first, and after bullet sounds ensued, Benedict revealed himself. It was a shot meant for delivering the finishing blow to Cattleya's offensive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shooting the legs of all the men in black except Salvatore, Benedict clicked his tongue at the gruesome scene inside the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's this? Hasn't V eaten out most of them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Together with a sigh, he threw away the gun he had been holding, taking out another one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Old Man~, we've left only this important-looking old dude~."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux! Violet is protecting you, right? President! You're tied up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya ran towards Hodgins, who lay on the floor. Without cutting them with a knife, she ripped off the ropes that had been restricting him using the iron knuckles and embraced him boldly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins patted her back with taps and hugged her lightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Cattleya. Didn't my adorable young lady get hurt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Atta girl." Hodgins left a kiss on Cattleya's forehead with a pop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya's cheeks flushed red and she turned her back to him looking embarrassed, stamping her feet onto her happiness on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict tore Cattleya away from Hodgins and stood between them. Contrary to being angry, he aggressively hit Hodgins from face to torso, confirming that the latter was alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch, ouch, what's this? A new way of expressing love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're fine, huh, Captive Princess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were worried about me, Darling?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins merely replied with frivolous talk to Benedict's cynicism, looking delighted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Briefly biting his lip, Benedict faced the ground. Hodgins had a feeling that the eyes Benedict had directed at him before casting them downward were moist, and was inwardly surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Huh, could it be he really was worried?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Darling. Benedict."</p>
<p class="null-p">His sandy-blond hair rubbed into a mess, Benedict finally resisted energetically as if to say, "Quit it".</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing that resembled tears could be seen in his eyes anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who's that 'Darling', Old Man...?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be you were pretty worried about me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was fully convinced that Benedict would deny it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was. Don't make me." Yet the latter directed his sky-blue eyes straight at him and said, "I was hella worried. Don't ever make me worry again no matter what!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As it was much too blunt, after Hodgins was taken aback, his face slowly turned red. He had anticipated they would come save him, but right now was his first time learning he was cherished to that extent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah... that so? S-Sorry, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn... Don't go getting kidnapped when you've got that huge body! Is Captive Princess #2 all good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fairly. Little Lux needs first-aid...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet undid Lux's binding. The latter's body, which had been trembling in fear, and the sound of her heartbeats, which had grown noisy, were regaining their calm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">Enduring the pain in her cheek, Lux smiled at the friend who had come for her rescue,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you were some noble prince."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet furrowed her eyebrows as if troubled. She then resentfully held Lux's hands and helped her up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My apologies for not being able to protect you. But I will not let you go through terrifying times anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like a knight, she made Lux retreat to behind her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Albeit gripping his gun, Salvatore remained unable to fire a single shot at the mere three people who had taken control of his company. As he shifted his gaze to the side, he could see his underlings collapsed and moaning in the open corridor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There was supposed to be... fifty of them," once he opened his mouth, his voice shook.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah? Your minions? Even if the numbers are big, it's no use if the quality sucks. Actually, were there that many of them? I was counting, but... Stupid Woman, how many did you take down?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stupid Benedict! Erm... ten. I probably beat up about ten people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got twenty. The rest was V, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I simply came here by climbing the outer walls, so other than the beginning and now..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't anyone run away? The math ain't adding up."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were chatting carefreely, yet the contents of the conversation were the number of people they had defeated. In addition, there was an overwhelming difference in combat power, for they were unharmed and not even their clothes had scratches. That was also a difference in corporation power.</p>
<p class="null-p">Biting his lip as if in frustration, Salvatore barked at</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins,</p>
<p class="null-p">"They came late, and that's why you've lost! I already had you write the contract! The official scrivener went to submit the contract we exchanged to the government office so that it'd serve as a demonstration of formal legitimacy. It's probably already been accepted... Take your leave as you please. But I'm billing you for the internal damage caused by your subordinates and the injuries they inflicted on mine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore had intended to wreak both psychological and bodily pain on Hodgins for a while, instilling terror on him and making him lose the will to fight back, but now he had given up on it. What he desired most ‐ the unequal contract ‐ was in a state of legal effectiveness. As long as he had it, regardless of what anyone could say, the fact that Salvatore had the advantage would not change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Salvatore Rinaudo. What're you on about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Hodgins had a facial expression that denounced he was helplessly puzzled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I said, your company can no longer enter our routes..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter how much brute force we used, that's nothing in the face of a validated official document!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again... so what? The papers were indeed filed. Seems like they also were submitted before help came. What of it?" Claudia Hodgins, president of the CH Postal Company and former major from Leidenschaftlich's army, generally had an easygoing personality, as well as a cheerful and frivolous attitude. However, he was now glaring at Salvatore without breaking into a smile, letting a glint shine sharply in his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it a matter that'll be solved if we crush down your company?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He rolled up his shirt's sleeves and took off a wristwatch that one could tell was a high-grade product. Next, he squeezed the strap with his fingers so that the watch's case would be on his knuckles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anybody who was used to fighting knew. If one was battling without a weapon, the object called wristwatch was an overly useful thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Salvatore, if only you hadn't hit Lux, I wouldn't be this angry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Salvatore fired at Hodgins when the latter swung up his hand, yet it did not even graze him. Oddly enough, the bullet that had failed to kill a person shot through the middle of the forehead of Salvatore's portrait sitting inside the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sto..." The word that Salvatore uttered were the end of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fist swung by a 194cm-tall man who weighted 85kg struck into Salvatore's face with a wind-cutting sound. As his nose was broken without mercy, Salvatore shed a large amount of blood. A few of his teeth tumbled onto the highquality carpet as well. He had convulsions for a moment, but eventually became completely motionless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did you kill him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">At Benedict's question, Hodgins put his ear against Salvatore's chest, shaking his head after simply checking the other's heartbeat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's alive. Let's leave him be."</p>
<p class="null-p">By the instant he turned around, Hodgins had gone back to his usual self.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, you did well. I'm so happy; my employees sure are the best. And I'm also the best for having chosen you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins sang praises gesturing exaggeratedly, embracing the employees who had come for his aid all at once. He then came closer to Lux's side, planting a kiss on the cheek that had not been punched.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've made you go through a lot, huh. I'm really sorry, Little Lux."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm the president's secretary, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing as she did not appear too bashful, that sort of kiss was likely not a rare action. As the thread of tension broke, Lux crumbled and shed large tears. Hodgins frantically apologized again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it... I'm frustrated... It'd be great if I were like everyone else, and also had strength to protect the president. If I hadn't been taken hostage, things wouldn't have turned out like..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya gently caressed Lux's arching back as she was</p>
<p class="null-p">unable to stop crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What're you saying? Lux, you have it good exactly because you're a normal fragile girl. Ah, but it's not like I'm not normal either. I'm strong and pretty, but I'm a super normal girl..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya, what you say is inconsistent."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet handed Lux a silk handkerchief.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps due to their heights being about the same, despite their faces not resembling one another and their body types being different, the figure of the tree as they nestled close to each other strangely made them look like sisters.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seeing girls huddling together is kinda nice, right,</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Old Man, just hurry and do something about this place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should we huddle too? Shall we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't play around and give the instructions!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Benedict dealt him a strong lateral kick to the rear, Hodgins ceased joking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh~, then, all dismissed...! That's what I'd like to do but I have a request. Anyone who doesn't have any plans for later, please help me destroy Salvatore's company!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He~y, Old Man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, Mr. Benedict?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You haven't checked things out so you don't know what's been made of it, but we left the international offices to the rest of the fighter staff. The guys who stayed at the main office contacted them. Since it's those fellows... they'll take them out without worries."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amazing! But we don't have fighter staff! It's not like I hired you with that intention! Well, since there have to be people who can go into battlefields, I didn't not have that intention, but..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"From the very start, that was our purpose, President Hodgins. So that there will not be such happenings after this, we believed that laying waste to everything and thoroughly annihilating them was a good plan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Scary, scary. Your expression is getting scary too, Little</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet. Smile! It's ruining your cute face!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"President~! I want you to buy me a new choker after we're done. Look~! The pearls on it got torn off... It was my favorite too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, Cattleya. Be it chokers, clothes or anything, this uncle will buy it for you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hum... President. What should I do?" the non-fighting staff member Lux tightly clutched her skirt, looking nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Little Lux, let's go back to the head office. I'll have you be treated there too. It's all right; everyone in the head office contacted the other employees, so there should be people gathering there. It's safer than you coming with us. Benedict, take Little Lux to the head office, and then regroup."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger; leave some for me to mess with too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We aren't sharing cake slices... Now, Little Violet and Cattleya are going with me to crush the branch offices just like this. Let's decide on the rules for one. No hitting girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hitting bastards is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Ka~y."</p>
<p class="null-p">The members of the CH Postal Company continued their strategy meeting without paying mind to the people that they had defeated lying on the floor. When they were done at last, they exited the building while making so that those of Salvatore's postmen who had stood up once again would be beyond recovery.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lighting a cigarette, Hodgins started walking with it in his mouth, and everyone followed him as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day, within Leidenschaftlich, gunshots echoed throughout several areas of the capital Leiden, yet no one attempted to keep them under control. Additionally, the military police did not make a move regardless of how many reports it received.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The nocturnal darkness deepened late into the night.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lights were brightly lit in a bar at the corner of a business district. "Fully booked for the day." said the clumsy letters on a paper pinned to the menu board in front of the shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">The figure of a seductive female dancer was drawn on said board. By the looks of it, that was a place where people enjoyed shows along with their meals.</p>
<p class="null-p">The voices of people laughing pleasantly and lively music could be heard leaking from inside the bar. It seemed to be the feast of some company. The men and women were at a one-one ratio. Their ages varied and all of them differed in skin, hair and eye colors.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even amongst them, there was an attention-catching few.</p>
<p class="null-p">A young man was displaying splendid steps on a table with heeled boots that looked like womenswear. The dancers swayed their bodies together with him and danced purely as they pleased.</p>
<p class="null-p">On another table, a beautiful woman was smiling while arm-wrestling with a man of fiendish facial features and plentiful muscles. Seeing as she twisted his arm in a matter of seconds, it could be that he let her win on purpose. However, the man who had lost rubbed his seemingly hurt arm with a strangely believable face.</p>
<p class="null-p">A silver-haired young girl with a big gauze on her cheek was playing a card game with a blonde person of terribly tattered appearance. It was most likely poker. She looked troubled for not being able to read the other's expression. While everyone else was emptying bottles of alcohol, only the two of them were making cups of tea into their nighttime company. Each was fixated with their own victory, playing in earnest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah~! I won~! I won enough to buy a kinda nice pair of shoes! Ah, Lux, aren't those winning cards?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Women who can dance sure are great. V, you suck at playing this, don't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict, who had had enough of dancing, and Cattleya, who had grown tired of arm wresting, came to sit at the peaceful table as if to intrude on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux put the cards that she had been hiding up to her lips on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Want to quit poker, Violet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is right. The cards in our hands have been busted by a third party, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">They did not have the will to get angry. If anything, Lux was so happy for being able to return to that trifling daily life with her companions that she wound up laughing. Perhaps due to the spot where she had been hit aching when she laughed, she arched her back with an "ow, ow, ow".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you okay? Is it not better for you to rest already...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yu~p, but I think it's safer to be with everyone for the day... President Hodgins is here too so I can't go home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya quickly reacted and looked at Lux's direction with momentum.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We've decided that I'll be with the President today. See, it's because the President's home was in the company's top floor. We have nowhere to sleep tonight, right? I also had that experience with being kidnapped... He was worried and got me a room at a hotel in the city. It seems President Hodgins will also be staying in it for a while. Until this mess is over, I'll also be working from there. We're going together today, so I have to wait for him."</p>
<p class="null-p">While Violet replied agreeably with a, "That is reassuring."</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya became beet-red. One could tell from her face what she was imagining. She grabbed Lux's arm and shook her violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You! Do you get what you're saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Eeh? Our rooms are separated, y'know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cattleya, Lux is injured."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not a chance. Dunno how many years it'll last, but not even he is that shameless."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey! Don't meddle into a girls' talk!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you've said it. Then don't barge into when I'm talking with the Old Man no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since another fight had decidedly began, as an accustomed form of coping, Violet and Lux left the two and started their conversation afresh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which... Violet, are you okay? You're dressed pretty cutely today... Could it be you were going to meet up with that person... with Mr. Major?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she received such question was exactly when Violet's gaze had fixed on the bar's entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone was heading her way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps due to having come in a hurry, said person was out of breath. His sweat-dampened forehead was a proof of the efforts he had been spending until arriving there. He was caught by Hodgins and came to a halt, but even so, he aimed at and went toward her as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">That person had soon spotted Violet from the bar's entrance, and Violet had frozen in place the instant he had arrived as well. It was almost as if there were gravity between them that drew one to the other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet stood up naturally and rushed to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Ah, Violet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux could tell.</p>
<p class="null-p">--I see, so that's how it is.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyone who was close by would be able to tell.</p>
<p class="null-p">--The two of you are already like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, it was as though the air about her had changed completely the moment he had appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Colonel."</p>
<p class="null-p">The one standing there was Colonel Gilbert Bougainvillea from Leidenschaftlich's army.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because he was on an off day, he wore only a</p>
<p class="null-p">jacket of fine tailoring and a shirt. Inquisitive stares from the people making a ruckus in the bar fell upon him all at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, he was a man rumored within the company for moving the army in order to protect Violet. His existence was made known during the hijacking incident of the</p>
<p class="null-p">Intercontinental train, after which a year had passed not too long before. Of course, that was a story only told internally and Hodgins was publicly regarded as the main leader of such strategy.</p>
<p class="null-p">The members of the postal company who had gathered up to save her had seen in person the man who came running while carrying her princess style. Back then, they had also witnessed Benedict being entrusted with Violet, his mouth open as if he had grown senile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Colonel, my apologies... I ended up breaking our arrangement."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cottony hair was ruined. The outfit chosen for her and that her body was clad in had become like ragged cloths. Everything she had prepared for him had been reduced to misery today.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, seeing her dressed-up caused Gilbert's heart to beat louder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You look beautiful." was what he had started to say, but upon noticing a stare of pressuring quality to a fierce extent from the side, he trailed off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Benedict seemed extremely unamused. He clicked his tongue as their eyes met.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anything the matter...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really. There any law that says I can't look at the bastard who snoops into V's general area every once in a blue moon ever since that incident like he's a rare sight?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You helped me out holding onto Violet back then. I'm grateful... And, I don't know about any such law, but if it's about putting up a watchdog act, I'm the one on top."</p>
<p class="null-p">Something like an electric shockwave ran between the two of them. Benedict remained not toning down his distrust regarding Gilbert until now, peeved by that man who seemed like he could become a love rival for Benedict's significant other had he been in the same workplace as them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This was the curtain rise of their muddled battle!" Just as the two had opened their mouths again, Hodgins cut in with a foolish commentary.</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two simultaneously glared at Hodgins as if looking at something deplorable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins himself broke Gilbert and Benedict apart, coming in between them, putting his arms around each and laughing stridently,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't fight for me! Man~, I wanted to try saying this once."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up, Old Man!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stay away, Hodgins. You're reeking of booze."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a conversation with a magnificent explosive power. By the looks of it, Gilbert and Benedict did not seem like they would get along, but their attitude towards Hodgins was similar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Old Man, tomorrow will be terrible for you if you drink too much. You're at that age, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Darling... you're saying that because you're worried about me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, stop. Stop. I'm not a woman."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Benedict stepped away from Hodgins, who was attempting to give him a kiss, Gilbert and Violet were at last able to lock eyes with each other again. Violet had a face that denounced she had gone through a hellish time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Any injuries?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Minor ones. The same level as scratching a knee."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's good..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was truly saying so from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Cattleya and Lux anxiously observing the two of them, Gilbert spoke further, "You too, any injuries? Aah... you need a medic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no, I'm okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had already received treatment, yet it seemed like her wound might open the next day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps always carrying it in his person, Gilbert took a fountain pen and small notebook from his jacket's inner pocket, handing her a paper sheet that contained a certain address within Leiden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the clinic where my home doctor is. You don't need to pay if you give my name, so go there another day. You'll probably need painkillers for a while. Even in the hotel you're staying at, please give my name to the hotelman if you need anything. We're on friendly terms, so he'll treat you well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux acted uncertain when accepting the paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah. Thank you very much. You're very generous... Could it be... that the hotel reservation... Mr. Bougainvillea, erm...</p>
<p class="null-p">Colonel Bougainvillea, was made by you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After glancing at Hodgins, who was entangling himself with Benedict, Gilbert nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That thing asked me for it. I can't say this aloud but I've also disposed of... the documents submitted to the government office in the name of your company. When I use my influence in places outside of my jurisdiction... I end up losing one card that I could otherwise use in the event of an emergency, but..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps as if remembering something, he furrowed his brows a little and chuckled. "Hodgins took care of Violet. I also won't spare any efforts for you all in case something happens. If there's any worrisome matter, it can even be through Violet, but do tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Cattleya and Lux mutely let their cheeks dye pink. Was there any girl whose heart would not throb at Gilbert as he displayed adult-man-like reliance in a different way from Hodgins?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Colonel, you're so cool." "Colonel, you are wonderful."</p>
<p class="null-p">No, there was not.</p>
<p class="null-p">For whatever reason, the two had their fingers interlaced in front of their chests and were striking the same pose.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert replied levelly, "You aren't my subordinates so you don't need to refer to me by my rank."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet pulled the hem of Gilbert's jacket ever so lightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Colonel, hum... would you like to sit down? You must be tired."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, no. I'm sorry but I'm taking my leave. You too, Violet. The two are at the Bougainvillea house and we're making them worry. I already contacted them to say I'd bring you back, so come along. It stopped by a place a little far away, but I have a carriage ready, so let's walk there. Miss Lux. You... were together with Hodgins for today, right? Miss Cattleya, what about you? We can send you home if necessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You know my name?! Mine?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course; I heard it from Violet. So, what will you do?" Perhaps due to extreme happiness at that, Cattleya slapped Violet's back with quite strong force countless times in high spirits.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine! I'll be here with everyone until morning today!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's probably better if you're in big numbers. Well, my apologies since we're in the middle of a pleasant talk, but I'm taking her along. Thank you... for always being so close to Violet. Let's meet again somewhere else. Please let me at least treat you to a meal."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert all too naturally took off his jacket and placed it over Violet's shoulders. He began escorting her away just like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! Bastard! Hold on! V is my little sister part!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone, good night. Benedict too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait! V~! Hey-Old Man!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Binding Benedict's arms behind his back, Hodgins sent Violet a wink.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that he was drunk, but his tactic was probably to keep Benedict away from Gilbert. He might have been paying for the sin of making the two of them miss out on the time they had to spend with each other because of his kidnapping.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hodgins and Gilbert merely exchanged short goodbyes such as, "I'll call" and, "See you".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Benedict's had an overwhelming defeat, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Old Man!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Man, he's rivaling you... but he's also not."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two young women left behind spoke while still staring at the bar's entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, the President told me a lot about Violet's past after that incident, and I didn't not wonder if someone like him was okay for her... but, when you meet him, y'know..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, its different when you get to meet him, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because he really did cherish her that he made many mistakes, did his best to take back a lot of things, and now they're like this, huh..." Lux whispered, deep in thought.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇ ◈ ◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Treading through an autumn night in which the nocturnal winds were gelid robbed the two a little of the body heat provided by the warm interior of the bar. Violet, who Gilbert had put his jacket over, looked at him with only his shirt on as if to question him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He soon noticed her gaze and their eyes met. He then smiled at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you cold?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just from him simply throwing those words at her, as Violet was still unused to it, her heart raced.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No; Major, what about you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The times that the two of them met up were still at a point where they could be counted with one hand, and during such instances, the restraint brought about by his long absence would manifest itself in the form of agitation. From the perspective of others, that could almost not be perceived. After all, her facial expressions were generally emotionless.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine. I've run around and sweated a lot today, so I'm still warm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My apologies, Colonel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing to apologize for. I did that because I wanted to. Violet. It was also for Hodgins's sake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right, Colonel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's walk a little slower. Once we get on the carriage, the way home will last a blink of eye."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that bad...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who had made the request was Gilbert, and the words Violet was about to say wound up dying out before they could take form. That was because he sweetly added, "I don't have enough time with you".</p>
<p class="null-p">"All right, Major."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes spoke more eloquently than her expressionless self. Violet's blue orbs were glued to Gilbert's emerald ones.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to chat a little too. Is everything okay with that young man called Benedict?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"By that, you mean...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He seems to favor you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He has another woman that he fancies. It seems they are in a relationship, and they themselves are hiding it but everyone around them knows."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, he is... in an older brother-like... position regarding... my person, he told me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Told you? That man?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Their eye and hair colors were certainly similar, and the man could be said to be an androgynous beauty, but his speech and conduct were much too different from Violet's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He himself was saying so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, he indeed called you his 'little sister part'... Should I interpret that as him showing affection for you...? But it doesn't look like we will get along very well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will probably be difficult."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Violet had heard the story of Hodgins and Gilbert's past, she estimated that such assumption would be disproved. Gilbert and Hodgins were also a duo that one would not think got along well.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems he'll get in the way when I'm with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since Gilbert made a face as if he had swallowed a bittertasting bug, Violet did not voice her opinion in the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Major."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Violet called him, the middle of his brows immediately softened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you had managed to meet with me as planned today, where did you intend to go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, I had actually made an arrangement for us to go horse-riding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Horses."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can ride army horses, and I think long rides aren't bad if it's on fine autumn weather days... Did you not like it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Colonel, there is nothing that I dislike if I am in your company."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That answer makes me happy, but I do believe I want to learn about your tastes little by little. Kukuh."</p>
<p class="null-p">As Gilbert suddenly laughed aloud, Violet tilted her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You... probably haven't noticed it, but you've been mixing up 'Major' and 'Colonel' when referring to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">As he had been promoted from major to lieutenant-colonel and from lieutenant-colonel to colonel, it could be said that referring to Gilbert with a lower rank was terribly inappropriate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet corrected her posture and apologized again, "I... am sorry. My apologies, Colonel."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not it. I'm not angry... Ever since you were little, you used to call me that. The first word I heard from you was this one, too. I'm saying that if you can't get used to it, I don't mind the 'Major'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Colonel'... Colonel, I will not mistake it anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her figure as she attempted to memorize it, in order not to forget it, was lovably stubborn. Gilbert caught a glimpse of her past self from that immature aspect of hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the beginning, the two of them had had an inept exchange. Almost like how children would do it, they had told each other their names.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ma... jor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you understand what I'm saying, Violet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Major."</p>
<p class="null-p">After learning words and coming to know discipline, she had become his weapon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that is Major's order..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not an order..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If... it is your desire..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had wound up loving the girl-weapon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Major's eyes are here." "I wonder... what this is called."</p>
<p class="null-p">It had been a one-sided love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will become your 'shield' and 'weapon'."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I shall protect you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do not ever doubt this. I am your 'asset'."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, he had loved her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want to let you die! Violet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you, Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl-weapon had wept that she did not understand what she had been bestowed with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is... 'love'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No one had taught her about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is... 'love'? What is... 'love'? What is 'love'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do not understand, Major..."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had also not understood why he had said such a thing to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is... 'love'?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She had searched for the meaning of those words and for him, who had disappeared, encountering them by chance at last.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, they had reached the present time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert took her artificial fingertips as she stood still.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her index finger made screeching sounds. "Since we're at it, won't you call me by my name?" He pointed her finger at himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fingertips that used to be soft and have body temperature in the past did not anymore. The same applied to one of Gilbert's arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Gilbert. Gilbert Bougainvillea." He pointed at Violet next. "You are Violet. Violet Evergarden."</p>
<p class="null-p">He moved the finger both ways, saying, "Gilbert, Violet...</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert, Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two who had ended up with mechanical part had grown and changed. They were not parent and child originally. Not siblings, either. They had also ceased being superior and subordinate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lord Gilbert."</p>
<p class="null-p">At Violet's predictable response, Gilbert smiled bitterly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The 'lord' part... isn't necessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">He had supposedly spoken gently, yet Violet showed him an aspect of disconcertment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My apologies... Have you... come to hate me...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. I don't know how to feel anything but affection towards you... It appears that..."</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking that it was also valid for himself, Gilbert stated, "hum... you become insecure about it every now and then, but I'll never hate you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How come?" Violet asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">How great would it be if he were able to show the insides of his heart to her? Presenting with a form that "this is love" would be so simple. However, it was due to not being able to do such a thing that people uttered words to proffer their love.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I love you most."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet started searching for that term within the sea of words embedded inside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"'Love... most'..."</p>
<p class="null-p">As they rolled out of her tongue, what appalling yet passionate words those were.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no other sentence more fitting of Gilbert Bougainvillea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Love me... most?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have eyes for nobody but you. You're the only one I'm fond of."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is... to love most?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will hold you dear for eternity, and continue to love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not ask "That is... to love most?" a second time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's cheeks were rose-dusted, her heart started palpitating to the point of aching, and her field of vision blurred. She was unable to look at Gilbert's face. Unwittingly, she cast her head down, yet he wound up peering at it. The distance between their faces was just about enough for them to kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was currently nighttime and the two of them were alone in that place, so whatever they did, no one would be looking. Maybe they could manage to keep it a secret even from God.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had a phase of... liking you... then I fell in love with you, and now, it turns out I love you the most. Do you understand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does it never diminish?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The affection?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wonder. But I don't want that to happen and will probably reconfirm whether I do love you numerous times, so it'll likely intensify, not decrease. You fill me up with it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"With love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. The reason why I believe I love you is because you granted me that feeling."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet Evergarden, who had been learning and copying from him ‐ from people ‐, was able to take in the meaning of those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I do that to you, Major?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Again, her manner of referring to him had changed. Gilbert thought it was fine either way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You do that to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert silently planted a kiss not on Violet's cheek or lips but on the fingertips that he was holding onto.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/violet-evergarden/illustrations/violet-evergarden_vol_03_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Those were artificial fingers. She was unable to feel anything from them. Her arms were gone, and would nevermore return.</p>
<p class="null-p">Placing a kiss on such a spot could transmit nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, he had deliberately kissed it in an affectionate manner. For some reason, that action ‐ Gilbert's feelings ‐ caused Violet's eyes to grow hot as if burning and produce tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet attempted to stop them. Those were incomprehensible tears. Why were they flowing at that moment? They would definitely trouble the man in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nevertheless, tears were already pooling in her moist eyes until, finally, a single drop spilled down. Sure enough, the round tear that had fallen from one of her eyes left Gilbert distraught.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her reaction, he promptly let go of her fingers, "I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">He stepped back, raising both hands as if to have her understand that he would not do anything else, "I'm really sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet did not answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">She stared at Gilbert without even wiping off the tear as if spacing out. Her attitude was not of anger. Her aspect was not of sorrow, either. He had no idea what she was thinking. She had the gaze of someone who seemed to be having a dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them had lived separately, and he had thought that her facial expressions had become richer ever since they had reunited, but once she clammed up, he could not read her. Her lack of expression and well-featured doll-like traits did not allow Gilbert to study her emotions. However, the one thing he could fathom was that his action just now had been foolish.</p>
<p class="null-p">--What am I doing?</p>
<p class="null-p">He had told her that he would wait however long it took. The kiss on her fingers might have been a violation to that promise. He should have been the best gentleman for her, but he may have lost that right.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she was by his side, she was unbearably endearing. The love towards her that lit up within his chest wound up overflowing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I swear I won't do it anymore..."</p>
<p class="null-p">An army colonel of Leidenschaftlich had lost face before the girl he was enamored with. "Violet..."</p>
<p class="null-p">What face was he making now? What did she think of it?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Major, I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet called him with her wind chime voice. She grabbed onto Gilbert's fingers and took one step forward. The distance between them had shrunk once again. And then she took another step.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was close enough to be embraced by Gilbert.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Violet..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Major... please."</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet peeked into Gilbert's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The emerald-green orbs that had unchangeably borne beauty, kindness and a little bit of loneliness ever since they had first met were right there. Violet was now reflected on them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet was inside his world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do not swear so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gilbert's eyelids blinked at her straightforward words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, do not swear... that you will not do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing tears well up in Violet's eyes once again, Gilbert impulsively reached an arm out to her. He caressed her golden hair as if to soothe her, earnestly listening to what she was trying to tell him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Major, you explained it to me, right? That to love is to think of wanting to... protect someone the most."</p>
<p class="null-p">He wiped her tears with his fingertips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet entrusted her cheek to his hand and shed more tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This has... applied to me since forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was attempting to replenish her lacking life. Rather, the truth was that the two of them could have done that from the moment they had met, for it was almost as if they made up for each other's unskillfulness, but they had missed one another countless times and had not intersected well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Violet's chest was now being filled up with a warm feeling that she was experiencing for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It always, always has, since long ago. I merely... did not know it..."</p>
<p class="null-p">--This loud throbbing in my chest, this ecstasy, the fact that I end up swayed by your every action...</p>
<p class="null-p">"I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">--...the reason why I cried that I wanted to be by your side and asked you not to leave me anymore... "Major... I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">--...the reason why I am crying now...</p>
<p class="null-p">"I, as of now..."</p>
<p class="null-p">--...is that, once the "like" and the "love" fell and piled up like snow, and I became unable to melt them down, I had wanted to let you know that I wished the same to be valid for you.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...have a feeling that I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">People would declare it as if offering a prayer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...understand it better than before." "I love you." that is.</p>
<p class="null-h2">To be continue...</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">Dear you, have things been well? Spring, summer, fall, winter ‐ in which season are you reading this letter?</p>
<p class="null-p">It remains here, as unshakable as trees. It is waiting for you. I will be happiest if this story manages to turn into one of that kind.</p>
<p class="null-p">It has been a while since we last saw each other, so this is a little embarrassing. I end up shying away.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had several stories before I was able to form Violet's, so I integrated the stories that I had not been able to publish no matter what due to certain circumstances and told them in this volume. Thank you very much to the people who said they wanted to read the continuation. Just like a single drop of water falling onto the surface of a lake and causing ripples to spread out, those voices of yours became the trigger for me to earn this opportunity. In the very sense of the word, it is a work that both you and I have made.</p>
<p class="null-p">The things called books are like living creatures. The writers themselves are living creatures as well, and the ones who nurture both parties are the readers.</p>
<p class="null-p">I feel like my mind has matured quite a lot in comparison to when I started writing words for the first time. I conveyed in the afterword of the first volume that I had begun writing due to thinking about living on my own, but the truth is that there was one more reason for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was very battered when I decided to aim for novelist, but I did not want to lose. I began wishing ardently that I wanted a weapon to fight against my fate. If I could draw, I might have gone for art. If I were good at singing, for music. Anything was fine as long as it was something I could do well. I was extremely empty back then, so I wanted to create something by myself and show it to people anyhow. I wanted them to praise me. This evaluation is unlike my current self, but I thought it would become the only and last writing challenge against life that someone as helpless as me could take on.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, while I was struggling desperately, Kyoto Animation-sama picked me up. Upon finishing all sorts of things, I have even more of a real feeling that it sure is wonderful how companies possess the media to continue the work after you conclude writing. I am truly glad that I could send Violet out into the world. I hope this story, which was made by the hands of several people, will be loved as if it were a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to be with you longer... but it is about time for us to depart.</p>
<p class="null-p">You might somewhat think that I am about to cut into an extremely lonesome way of saying goodbye, but there will be no end to this. I will surely be writing somewhere, and you will be reading from somewhere else.</p>
<p class="null-p">We have liking books as a point in common. Therefore, someday, there shall definitely come a day when we will meet again. Violet, too, will appear in any part of any country at any given time as long as her customer is there, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lastly, I offer my utmost gratitude. To Kyoto Animationsan, the people who work in it, the professionals whom I have met everywhere through the process of making the anime, the bookstores, my friends and family, and you. You. Thank you very much for sticking with me until the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please be well. I am cheering for you. Do not forget that I am cheering you on. I will do my best too. Because you exist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, then, may a wonderful moment come about to all those who were linked by fate.</p>
