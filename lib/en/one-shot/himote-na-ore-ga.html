<p class="null-h1">Prologue. Et tu, Brute!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, erm… Tosa-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The quiet voice stopped me. Friday, school was out. After putting my belongings into my locker along the corridor, I stood stiffly at the entrance of the classroom I was heading into, and observed the girl before me in surprise. She was a female student who seemed really mature, with dark pupils, short black hair and porcelain skin. She was a little nerdy, but very cute. She wasn't from my class, and from the red sash on her uniform, she was in the second year like me. I didn't know her, but, she did called for 'Tosa-kun'. My name is Tosa Itsuki. This wasn't a mistake or something like that, she was referring to me. - A girl from a different class was looking at a boy from another class! And intentionally! Chatting me up. And doing so after school.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I had no idea who she was at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">This… This was definitely it!</p>
<p class="null-p">I gulped due to excessive nervousness. After entering high school, I have seen this a few times already. That mouthwatering scene that I yearned for was finally happening to me…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I-Is something the matter? I-I-I'm Tosa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I really hate myself for my inability to speak smoothly before a girl around my age. However, she didn't mind this at all, and looked at me as if she was relieved. Seeing this reaction, my expectation gauge became even higher. In my second year of high school in autumn, finally, finally I…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for bothering you so suddenly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I-It's fine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">My heart was already throbbing. When would she say the decisive words…! I am ready for it anytime. Come on!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm,"</p>
<p class="null-p">The female student said squeamishly:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you know where Kazuya-kun is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…… Kazu- ya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of Kazuya, that should be my friend in the same class as me since first year of high school. He should be at the teacher's office right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because we promised to go home together starting today."</p>
<p class="null-p">The female student said with a bashful but blissful expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa-kun, You are Kazuya-kun's friend, right? That's why I know your name… Because Kazuya-kun didn't seem to be inside the classroom… And as you know, Kazuya-kun don't have a smartphone</p>
<p class="null-p">yet..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nami-chan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't need to answer, and the subject Kazuya himself ran towards us with a shout.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- chan? He used her name plus chan to address a girl?</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be hard to do this unless they were close. He actually pulled off such a difficult move right in the face of an unpopular high school boy?</p>
<p class="null-p">Nami-chan's face turned energetic when she heard him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kazuya-kun!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry! I needed to visit the teacher's office for something! It took longer than I expected!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm-hmm, that's perfectly fine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">He got close to her, and the two of them looked into each other's eyes wordlessly. They were completely in their own world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was wondering why was Kazuya running all of a sudden… He seemed distracted in the teacher's office too, so he just didn't want to make her wait."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tens of seconds later, my other friend Yamai Gonzaburou appeared. He was forced to do manual labour in the teacher's office by our homeroom teacher along with Kazuya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gon-chan…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- You said it didn't you? You called me by that nickname!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His name was Gonzaburou, he felt the name was outdated and detested it, and want others to address him by his family name. But I didn't have time for all that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"C-Could this be..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Following my gaze, Gon-chan,</p>
<p class="null-p">"What-? Ohh, Kazuya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">He muttered. Nein!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Girlfriend!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who reacted to my yell was Nami-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"G-Girlfriend..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face was flushed, and was completely affirming it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahh, Itsuki and Gon… No! Yamai."</p>
<p class="null-p">And Kazuya finally realized we were here. That's how deeply they had immersed themselves into their own world!</p>
<p class="null-p">Kazuya introduced us to each other. Her name was Nami, Kazuya's girlfriend, they started dating yesterday. And they were actually neighbours, and knew each other since kindergarten. It's that thing right, how they would visit each other's rooms through the window? It happens in Manga all the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Childhood, friends."</p>
<p class="null-p">I muttered blankly while Kazuya scratched his head with a giggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Child… Childhood friends! The ambusher known as childhood friend was actually hiding amongst my friends? This wasn't scientific.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want a girlfriend"I really want one", Kazuya who always converse with me this way was actually… After our friends started dating one after another, my brother in arms who decided to remain a bachelor with me to the end, the final bastion of defence, Kazuya had actually…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"In conclusion, I'ill be going home with Nami! And sign up for a smartphone plan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gon-chan and I both showed expressions of shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">Smartphone, contract?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you were so stubborn when we talked about it, you actually…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kazuya was a high school boy who didn't have a mobile phone or smartphone. His parents didn't restrict him about that, this was sort of a matter of principle for him. He hate being tied down. It was troublesome to contact him, so we tried to convince him too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hey, it's better to have a phone with you anyways, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Gon-chan and I tried to persuade him numerous times… But no matter how much we preached about its convenience factor, it was no use. The persuasion that made Kazuya waver the most was "it would</p>
<p class="null-p">be easier to find a girlfriend". However, he realized immediately..."Isn't Itsuki a bachelor even though he has a smartphone? Which means a smartphone has nothing to do with girlfriends! So it's not necessary!" Why you…! Where did your principles go?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kazuya said frankly:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh? If I want to exchange contacts with Nami, then a smartphone is necessary, right!? And also, what's that app called again? Nami-chan will teach me how to use that too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, we will first start with 【Smile】."</p>
<p class="null-p">After taking his backpack from the classroom deftly, Kazuya showed a cheerful smile, and left while holding Nami's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">I already turned ashened as I watched them leave. I thought Nami would confess to me…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuki… Want to visit a ramen shop later? I don't mind treating you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gon-chan…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Friends were important after all. So that's friendship…!</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Gon-chan's phone buzzed. It seemed to be a message. After reading it, Gon-chan did a 180 and took back his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Scratch that, Akari seemed to be feeling troubled, let's leave the ramen til next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Friendship was as thin as paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">After patting my shoulder, Gon-chan headed towards class four where Akari, or rather, Sonoda-san was in. Sonoda-san was Gonchan's girlfriend. They started dating during the golden week of our second year. And today, Kazuya got a girlfriend who was also his childhood friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now, I was the only one among my friends that was still single.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Only I didn't have a girlfriend!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Things shouldn't be like this…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't help blurting that out!</p>
<p class="null-p">During one's lifetime, there were three period of times where you would be popular, and my time of youth would come when I enter high school! I had deep faith in this. That was why I stayed behind in Japan! When I graduated from middle school, my parents decided to take a job transfer overseas. Back then, I thought that I had to stay in Japan if I wanted my youth to come.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, I convinced my parents and grandfather-- And stayed in my grandfather's place. My grandfather was lax about boy-girl relationships, and would keep urging me to bring a girl back home.</p>
<p class="null-p">But since April last year-- after finally stepping through the gates of Honami High School, in terms of love, my love haven't come at all! To be honest, the female students were just an existence that was breathing inside the same classroom as me! More importantly, even when I spoke to them on purely official matters, I would start to stutter from nervousness. After going up to the second year, things only turned worse.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Speaking of high school life, that would be youth. It's the age when we become conscious of the opposite sex, the time for love.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, it was the same for everyone. For example, the guys would believe firmly that a heroine would appear before them.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that wasn't reality…!</p>
<p class="null-p">At least, if I had my attributes as a man was higher…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Regrettably, my face wasn't charming enough to attract girls without even saying a word…!</p>
<p class="null-p">I clenched my fists. As the last single guy, I reevaluated myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Height… 173cm, I guess I barely made the grade!</p>
<p class="null-p">Academics… average. I was quite good in middle school. Having a certain standard of results was one of the conditions for me to stay in Japan, so I couldn't afford to slack in my studies. Even if I worked hard, my studies were still average and not that impressive… If I stopped working hard, my grades would fall drastically.</p>
<p class="null-p">Physical abilities… negligible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Interests… I was heavily influenced by my grandfather and love games. I was proficient in all sorts of games, but loses out to my grandfather in terms of FPS. My favourite genres were musical games and FPS! However, FPS wasn't popular in Japan at all, I completely don't understand why that was so!</p>
<p class="null-p">That was about all…</p>
<p class="null-p">My parents named me Itsuki because they hope I could get first place. They definitely didn't name me that because I was born in</p>
<p class="null-p">January[1]. To be the greatest huh… It was the freedom of parents to put their hopes and dreams into their child's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wouldn't wish to be reincarnated into a handsome guy, but at least, I wish I wouldn't be that nervous when I interact with girls…! No, I wasn't completely a wreck all the time. If it was the girlfriend of my friend, or something else, basically girls where our relationship had no chance of progressing, I wouldn't hold any expectations, and so, I wouldn't be nervous...</p>
<p class="null-p">If I was conscious that the other party had the possibility of becoming a lover, I would stutter all the way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which meant, if I went on like this, my youth wouldn't come even when I graduate, what suffering…</p>
<p class="null-p">Alone by myself, I lowered my head along the corridor and sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa, you are in the way!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I just happened to be standing at the entrance of the classroom, and got shooed out of the way by the boys in the sports club who was leaving.</p>

<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1. Strange, Why Isn't My Heroine Appearing?</p>
<p class="null-p">As a loner dog, there was nothing more grieving then your friends showing off their love life. On weeknights before bedtime, I will roll around my bed in my room, and twiddle with my phone while showing a bitter face. Resting my cheek onto my left hand and propping myself up on my elbows, I slowly texted back with my right index finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">My friend Kazuya who had just started using a smartphone was very irritating. First, he called my home line and asked for my 【Smile】ID.</p>
<p class="null-p">The full name of 【Smile】 was 【Smile plus message】, so it's 【Smile】 in short. It was a free app that first marketed in America. And now, it took pride for having an overwhelming number of users throughout the globe, including Japan. So I told Kazuya my ID. After going back to my room on the second floor, Kazuya started showing off his girlfriend through 【Smile】.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was infuriating. But if I also had a girlfriend…!</p>
<p class="null-p">I lifted my head and looked into the distance. Now that I thought about it, it was the same for Gon-Chan… If I had to say what was different now… I got a girl's 【Smile】 ID… Although it belonged to Nami-chan!</p>
<p class="null-p">My gaze fell onto the phone… Wasn't that enough? I had enough of Kazuya and Nami's childhood friend stories…! And enough about your date today too!</p>
<p class="null-p">I decided to end the conversation by using emoticons. I returned to the home page after sending it, and a mail came in a few seconds later. I mainly contacted my friends through 【Smile】now. My email was now basically used to receive notification from school. That took up the main bulk of my mails, and I received emails regarding the student elections a few days ago too. Next would be the delivery notice when I buy something online. But I didn't buy anything… My parents? They would send me a long email about how they were doing overseas. Maybe that was it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tapped on the email app icon and checked the incoming mail.</p>
<p class="null-p">My guess was wrong</p>
<p class="null-p">【To our customer player,</p>
<p class="null-p">Congratulations on being selected!</p>
<p class="null-p">Our company is developing a game app geared towards men, 【There are no heroines in my youth】 and a game app geared towards women, 【There are no princes in my youth】 and is conducting an open beta to the public.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a stringent selection process, you have been chosen to be a free* pioneer user.</p>
<p class="null-p">(*No payment is required for usage in your region, but purchases made while starting or using the app would be categorized under other expenses. Please read the software instruction manual for further details.)</p>
<p class="null-p">This standalone program is able to make a prediction on the future between the customer and the heroine by using cutting edge technology. It will provide hints, and guarantee your meeting with a 【heroine that only belongs to you】.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason is, the heroine in the application will be linked to reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the value of the life prediction meter (*Please refer to the Instruction Manual for the detailed explanations on the term) will vary from person to person, and experience may be different for each customer. For some customers, situations that are a little high in difficulty may appear.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to experience a better life, please enjoy your meeting with a heroine brought to you by this application.</p>
<p class="null-p">The download code for you is 【3wen89ASZu8sxezgE2016】. User authentication will be done, so please ensure the application is downloaded and used by you personally.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, please tap on the below URL.】</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed to be an advertisement email for a new game. Was it sent in error?</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past, I requested for a magazine mailer by mistake when I was playing a game app. I already undid it, but was this the reason? From the URL, it didn't seem like I would be redirected to some porn site.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I still have a strange feeling about this. Normally, I would ignore such mails. The content was written seriously, but there was some obviously wacky parts mixed in. Predict the future and providing hints… Yeah right. This wasn't Science Fiction! Even with modern technology, the weather forecast would be wrong sometimes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the key term that hooked me was in there too. A heroine that only belongs to you or something, and the heroine would be linked to reality or whatnots.</p>
<p class="null-p">Heroine huh…</p>
<p class="null-p">I then received a new message from 【Smile】. It was Kazuya. He seemed confused by the emoticons, and finally understood with the help of Nami-chan. He replied to me with an emoticon. I felt a chill as I answered with another emoticon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Damn it, I want a girlfriend that would teach me how to use 【Smile】 gently too…!</p>
<p class="null-p">But in real life, the number of girls I was close to was 0…</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, I couldn't converse well with them because of my stutter… Thankfully, my friends that got attached introduced some girls to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I was too nervous and didn't know what to say. Even if I tried to make conversation, I would stutter all the way. I will stutter no matter what, so I stay silent which brought about the combo of 【boring】 【the conversation is going nowhere】 ! And then, that was the end of the interaction…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it is a game..."</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was a game, I won't be nervous. And a suitable game app was right before me. The title might be 【There are no heroines in my youth】, but a heroine would appear in this game right?</p>
<p class="null-p">My interpretation of the wacky content was that by inputting details of a girl you like, a heroine similar to that girl would appear, and the game would simulate a love story.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was it! Using this chance-- Even if it was a game, I want to quench my thirst! Please bestow me with a heroine!</p>
<p class="null-p">Tapping on my phone, I went to that URL and was prompt to enter my download code. After entering it and downloading, what appeared wasn't the title screen of the game, but the words 【Creating your avatar now, please do not enter fictitious information】.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It means the main character, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">My real name, birthday, height, weight and blood type was needed. It was a game, but the personal data it requested was a lot and surprised me. But it was for the sake of my heroine, so I will turn a blind eye this time!</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright, I entered my real details for the main character settings. What's next!?</p>
<p class="null-p">【What is the type of girl you want to date? Please think about two</p>
<p class="null-p">girls around you. Please exclude celebrities and idols. Depending on your answer, things that occurred in the game might happen.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright. It's here, this was it. I would be able to create a heroine to my liking? It was time to enter the data for the heroine.</p>
<p class="null-p">The field was different from the main character setting. Height, body shape, hair style, face and personality, five fields.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't take any field lightly, and had to choose seriously. These choices would probably influence how my heroine was!</p>
<p class="null-p">Because it was a game, I aimed for a girl around me that was out of my league and hard to approach in reality as the model for my heroine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Out of my league-- What I thought of was the two girls in my high school.</p>
<p class="null-p">One was in her third year. Mochizuki Rika who was one grade higher than me. A rich girl whose parents were capitalists. And she was called the Queen. This wasn't a joke, some of the male students addressed her that way and worshipped her. She gave the impression of a queen, and her full figure and sexy appearance resulted in many scandalous rumours about her. She was the type who didn't like to talk, and usually act loftily. As expected of a daughter of a rich family. However, I really wish to interact with a cold beauty like her! She was a girl that was that appealing to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything I knew about her was hearsay, and I only saw her onesidedly and never spoke to her before. But looking at her from afar, I could understand why she was said to have the looks and aura of a queen. Before I knew it, I started addressing her as Rika-sama. She was taller than the average girl too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama-- With Mochizuki Rika as the model, I entered the data for the first person.</p>
<p class="null-p">Height, 165cm.</p>
<p class="null-p">The body shape selection were a drop down list. There were boney, slim, average, thicc and gigantic. Next was breast size, flat, adequate and huge. There were endless combinations… Not. But were there people who would choose boney or gigantic? Slim and huge breasts! And so, the body shape was decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for hairstyle, first would be colour, followed by several long to short styles. Brown medium length hair then, although Rika-sama's hair would curl before her chest, but this detail couldn't be replicated faithfully. Even though that curl was a plus for Rika-sama… What a shame.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last would be personality. I had to pick two out of the ten choices of scary, gentle, aloft, vicious, violent, energetic, brave, quiet, yandere, wacky. But there seemed to be a few things that was out of place got mixed in… Or rather, something weird was in there…</p>
<p class="null-p">-- It would be fine if I didn't pick them. Rika-sama's personality seemed to fit aloft, but I didn't want my heroine to be that realistic! I will choose gentle and quiet then!</p>
<p class="null-p">Perfect!</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking this was enough, I did a final check and tap on confirm.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Your desired first person has been accepted successfully. The data will be used for the prediction. Do you want to continue entering the second person?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course I do.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I had to say who else around me would fit into the model of being out of my league, that would definitely be Nakajima Konoha. She was in her second year, just like me. Right now, she was taking part in the student council president election. A female student that fit the terms【Pure】,【Innocence】,【Nadeshiko】[1]. A perfect innocent type beauty which I couldn't believe existed in the 3 dimensional world. She was an existence that could match up to Rika-sama. And who would have thought? I have spoken to her once before!</p>
<p class="null-p">I was made a fool of myself before her but she still spoke to me with a smile. She was the type that didn't discriminate others based on looks and academic results an existence that couldn't be corrupted. I didn't think I could date a girl like her without any reservations, but a kind hearted girl was really appealing. As for looks, I prefer Rika-sama's style.</p>
<p class="null-p">With such a hope mixed in and using my impression of Nakajima Konoha as the base, I started keying the data for the second person.</p>
<p class="null-p">Height-- Nakajima-san was smaller in stature. To differentiate from the first person, she would need to be short anyway. 153cm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Body shape would be slim… Wait, let's use average and adequate here!</p>
<p class="null-p">I had to avoid the selection I already made!</p>
<p class="null-p">Hair style would be black and long. She was the epitome of pure, feminine beauty. The Nakajima-san in reality life had braids and hair accessories, but there wasn't such options here.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The possible candidates for personality were gentle, energetic, brave and quiet. Gentle and quiet had already been used, and going by elimination, it would be energetic and brave. Let me check the others… Scary, aloft, vicious, violent, yandere, wacky… I shook my head at this. None of them would work! I had an ominous feeling about the heroine that would be created! All rejected! I chose energetic and brave quickly!</p>
<p class="null-p">I made my choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">【The data for the second person had been accepted. The entered data for the first and second person is as follows.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The heroine setting that I entered after careful deliberation was displayed again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"! Ahhhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I cried out when I saw the personality field of the second person.</p>
<p class="null-p">It turned into v-violent and brave????</p>
<p class="null-p">I should have chose e-energetic and brave… Because violent and energetic was next to each other? I tapped too fast… and carelessly…! I didn't check the second person as carefully as I did the first person…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I knew I chose wrongly, I already missed the stage to correct it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The screen changed from the heroine settings screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Using the entered data as the basis, we will now perform a prediction of Tosa Itsuki-san's life. Please wait a moment.】</p>
<p class="null-p">It became like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">What a painful mistake. No no, it might just play a small part in the game, and the heroine's settings might not affect the script too much…! That's right, maybe the second person's character would be corrected to energetic and brave instead…!</p>
<p class="null-p">I sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not possible..."</p>
<p class="null-p">My heroine… although it was just in a game, she had the strange personality of being violent and brave…</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was sulking, the game finished its so called prediction.</p>
<p class="null-p">The title card 【There are no heroines in my youth】 appeared on my phone screen. I tapped the start button. The first person was set up perfectly, so I cheered myself up…</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The game should finally be starting, but what appeared was a screen of numbers, letters and punctuation marks. They kept popping up and filling the screen. The game froze, and after being forced close, it restarted again.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Error Code000000000000000000000】</p>
<p class="null-p">Huh, it restarted, but an error code on a black background appeared. Ehh, how do I close this? This was troubling!</p>
<p class="null-p">I decided to break through by tapping randomly. After doing so, the phone reacted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Something that could be seen as a challenge letter against me was displayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">【We did a prediction of your life, but you seem fated to not have any heroine to appear. The result of the prediction yielded 0 heroines. You will probably be single your entire life. As no heroine exists, your game couldn't start.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Hey."</p>
<p class="null-p">If this was a mobile game, now would be the time for it to ask me to pay up… How daring!</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that I didn't have a girlfriend! I admit that my heroine haven't made a debut in my life yet. Even so, there's no reason I would be condemned to being a bachelor for life, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">Although its selling point was about a 'heroine that only belongs to you', no heroine appeared. Don't you dare think this was acceptable, alright?</p>
<p class="null-p">As my emotions boiled over, I shook my phone with both hands and tapped hard!</p>
<p class="null-p">【But in this situation-- Tosa Itsuki-san could use an advance. By drawing an advance from your life, you could play this game for 5 days. However, a heroine must appear by the very last day and be confirmed. The repayment of the advance could be waived by meeting this condition. If the game ends in some other way, you will be forced to pay back the advance. For details please read 【regarding forced reparation】. You only have one chance to pay this game. Do you want to continue?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes or No?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was this… the game company's strategy? Maybe this screen would appear before everyone. But I would feel that I have lost if I choose</p>
<p class="null-p">'No' here, how infuriating. I would be a failure as a man if I chose no!</p>
<p class="null-p">So I tapped on yes!</p>
<p class="null-p">After tapping that, I realized I haven't read 【regarding forced reparation】 yet. Was this a mistake?</p>
<p class="null-p">-- So what!?</p>
<p class="null-p">For the sake of a heroine that only belongs to me! No regrets! 【According to the prediction of your life, the total advance possible will be 1,000,000 Sols. Playing the game for 5 days will require 300,000 Sols. Furthermore, the advance amount might fluctuate during the game. Sols cannot be paid back with cash. It has to be repaid with 300,000 Sols. Do you want to start the game?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes!</p>
<p class="null-p">300,000 Sols was nothing. In short, the ingame currency was Sols right?</p>
<p class="null-p">The part about not requiring cash was suspicious… If the situation where the Sols loan had to be repaid in cash arises, I would deal with it then!</p>
<p class="null-p">After tapping once, the dialogue box vanished. The currency within this app? The 300,000 Sols seemed to be loaned to me out of nowhere. There wasn't any in-app payment or request for my bank account number. Alright!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Using the data entered by Tosa Itsuki, the time period is set, characters has been generated.】</p>
<p class="null-p">After these words, the game started normally.</p>
<p class="null-p">The game date was set on 26th September, Monday.</p>
<p class="null-p">So it was slated to begin tomorrow huh. But I… Didn't enter the date. Well, extracting the date from the phone wasn't that farfetched.</p>
<p class="null-p">The main character-- the avatar of the player had the same name as me, 【Tosa Itsuki】. My name appeared in the dialogue box, but there wasn't any portrait of my avatar. It started with me leaving the house. My character was on the way to school.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, aside from dialogues, the main character would also have a monologue in his heart, but that didn't happen here. It seemed to be the type where the monologue was cut, and the game only progressed through dialogues. As for the explanation of movements, it was expressed with something like 【Tosa Itsuki left his house.】</p>
<p class="null-p">…There was BGM, so it seemed to be an orthodox visual novel game. The background wasn't a realistic artstyle or 3D models, from the way the story progresses by clicking on text, I couldn't tell how this was a system they claimed to have developed. The wacky email was a load of crap after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Where was the cutting edge technology? It didn't even feel sci-fi at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not just that, I didn't see any save or load functions either. The top right corner of the screen did have an icon that looked like the settings button, but it didn't respond when I press it. Was it that thing where you couldn't unlock it before you reach a certain stage?</p>
<p class="null-p">-- But no matter how trashy the system was, the important thing was the heroine.</p>
<p class="null-p">For this game, it would be fine if the heroine was good! That was the only thing I was looking forward to.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only expectations I had of 【There are no heroines in my youth】 was the heroine!</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as the cute heroine appears, I could turn a blind eye to everything else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who cares about the story! It was fine for the game to be boring too!</p>
<p class="null-p">Still… Still not here yet?</p>
<p class="null-p">Come out, my heroine!</p>
<p class="null-p">I continued in search of my heroine. But still nothing…Up until the other characters debut.</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar reached the classroom. Finally, a character with portraits appeared here!</p>
<p class="null-p">-- They were boys. 【Friend A】 and 【Friend B】. They probably didn't have names since they were side characters. But 【Friend A】 was tall and had a face like a samurai, and looked similar to Gon-chan. 【Friend B】 had a humourous feel about him, just like Kazuya. And 【Friend B】 seemed to have gotten a girlfriend recently. And the narration 【Friend B was boasting about his love life.】 appeared, but didn't have specific dialogues.</p>
<p class="null-p">And here, a choice branch appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Listen to Friend B rattle on until he is satisfied.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Punch Friend B out of rage.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Change the topic subtlety.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, I would expect the choices in such reading games to be related to the heroine… I couldn't guess the correct option. Which was it? The boasting was done inside the game, but I still don't want to listen so I will pass on the first option. I could empathize with the feeling behind number two, but beating him up suddenly was a little… I wasn't a young man who would lose my senses so easily, and 【Friend B】 resembles Kazuya a lot? Well, there was no doubt I should choose 'change the topic'.</p>
<p class="null-p">After selecting the 3rd option, my avatar…</p>
<p class="null-p">【…… I want a girlfriend too.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Said that to change the topic!</p>
<p class="null-p">How would this relate to meeting a heroine? 【Friend A】 and 【Friend B】 will hook me up?</p>
<p class="null-p">【How about joining the archery club now? There are plenty of single beauties there. Especially that freshman. What's her name again…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Mo… No, Ta…】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Friend A】 told me. I thought it would be the name of the heroine, but the only clue was 【Mo】 and 【Ta】… I was probably mistaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">【You think someone like me whose experience without a girlfriend is equal to my age can introduce a nice girl to you?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Friend B】 refuted my avatar. Speaking of which… it wouldn't be strange for a mobile game to have a full range of voices, but the script in this game wasn't dubbed… The heroine would also…?</p>
<p class="null-p">And the conversation ended without any conclusion… Just ended like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I stared at my phone, I shook my head. Deep breaths. Don't be anxious. Wasn't this just the prologue of the game? This was just showing me the game system. It would definitely not affect future choices. I wasn't frustrated. My temples weren't hurting!</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright, again! Tap!</p>
<p class="null-p">Even in a game, the job of a student was still attending class. My avatar didn't skip classes and time passed by peacefully. It felt just like 【Tosa Itsuki listening to the lecture of History B】.</p>
<p class="null-p">First period, History B. Second period, Conversational English II. Third period, Chemistry. Fourth Period, Modern Literature B.</p>
<p class="null-p">The timetable-- so far had been identical to the monday schedule for Class 2-2 of Honami High School. That was just like my timetable for tomorrow. The fifth and sixth period was the same too. What exactly…</p>
<p class="null-p">The advertisement email about predicting the future appeared in my mind. Gon-chan and Kazuya looking like 【Friend A】 and 【Friend B】 was also…</p>
<p class="null-p">I stared at the game screen, it wasn't anything special, just a classroom background that could be seen anywhere. The dialogue box was placed orthodoxically at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was impossible, right? I laughed at myself for being caught up in such a stupid thought momentarily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of that, the heroine was more important… When will she appear? During lunch break? Aside from that, it couldn't be anywhere else right? -- Let's continue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a small scene during Modern Literature B in the fourth period. The teacher called my name during class and my avatar started reading out loud. The teacher corrected the kanji that was pronounced wrongly. My avatar read 雪洞 as "se tsu do u", the correct answer was"bon bori", okay~.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, the exciting lunch break where the heroine would finally appear was here!</p>
<p class="null-p">The second choice branch came too.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Buy bread at the snack shop.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Pull a recycle bag[2] over your head and jump from the roof of one building onto another.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Go to the school cafeteria to order a 30,000 yen full course western meal, and get a stomach ache.】</p>
<p class="null-p">My expression turned stiff.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was this game looking down on me?</p>
<p class="null-p">The first choice would be the usual me. As my parents were stationed overseas, I was staying with just my grandfather. Both of us were mediocre in our culinary skills. Although we prepare our own breakfast, we would seldom get up early to make lunch boxes or something. My style was to sleep until the very last moment. My grandfather… he was retired, and spent his days leisurely. He would get up early too, but despite being 73 years old, he would occasionally play FPS for the entire night. And I like bread! Leaving all that aside, the snack shop in Honami High School was really delicious! Very delectable! Hence, my lunch would basically be bread.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, choosing the first option would do. It was a very familiar routine for me too.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for the second option, wasn't that just being a pervert!? Using common sense, I wouldn't meet a heroine even if I did that! And I would die if I fail! That's retarded!</p>
<p class="null-p">The third option… Well, I didn't have 30,000 yen, but since it was a game, so whatever. My avatar should have the money. But it wouldn't do if it taste horrible! Even more so if it upsets my stomach! Who would inflict self harm willingly!? Even if this was a game, the main character was still my avatar! That's pitiful!</p>
<p class="null-p">I retorted in my heart before I knew it. I adjusted my breathing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I choose to buy bread at the snack shop."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, my avatar went to the snack shop to buy bread. I picked a Yakisoba bread and a Teriyaki-egg bread. The narration 【Tosa Itsuki paid money】 appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yakisoba and a Teriyaki-egg…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I muttered softly with a frown.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the start of the second semester, Honami High School's snack shop revamped their menu. They even put in more effort into the old products while retaining their name. In order to dominate the new menu, I came up with a routine to try out all the bread. If an item was sold out, I would purchase it the next time.</p>
<p class="null-p">According to the schedule, Monday tomorrow would be Yakisoba bread and Teriyaki-egg bread. Tuesday would be chocolate croissant, fried prawn bun and cream sandwich. Wednesday was egg-tuna sandwich set and sweet bean paste bun. Thursday was almond bun, fried meat sandwich and cheese smoked meat sandwich. Friday was curry bun, onion bun and honey melon bun.</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar brought his bread just like I planned.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had plenty of similarities with me… Why was that…? How strange…</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Following that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't forget the most important thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still not here! Up til now! My heroine still didn't appear! Not even a glimpse!</p>
<p class="null-p">Would that be later? She would appear later? Could I believe in that? Something happened during lunch?</p>
<p class="null-p">…But nothing happened. Contrary to my expectations, my avatar ate in the classroom by his lonesome self. 【Friend B】 was with his girlfriend he just made recently, and 【Friend A】 already had a girlfriend, and was eating with her as usual. What was with my friends having a more exciting youth than me even in a game?</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar ate lunch as he listened mindlessly to the chatter around him, and lunch break ended like that. How could this be?</p>
<p class="null-p">If that was the case, only the time after school would be left--!</p>
<p class="null-p">But at this point, the screen turned black. The BGM stopped and there wasn't any sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">【The game prediction has ended for now. Please try again after some time. The time until the game is available will be--】</p>
<p class="null-p">A number was displayed in the form of a countdown. I could only continue after noon tomorrow. It didn't react when I tried tapping it.</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any sound, the countdown didn't speed up or disappear. Nothing changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That seemed to be it for the moment. Right?</p>
<p class="null-p">…I guess I will wait. It was understandable for a single play session of mobile games to be short. There was a restriction stopping players from rushing straight to the end, that should be it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, this was too plain, right? Where was the heroine?</p>
<p class="null-p">Where--was--the--heroine!</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't so much as a hint of her so far!</p>
<p class="null-p">The game was just for five days, but I already spent half a day? Which meant one tenth of the time had passed?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now that it has turned out like this, I will make the heroine appear even if I had to wring it..."</p>
<p class="null-p">At least in the game!</p>
<p class="null-p">I store my passion within my heart and to prepare for tomorrow-- It was time to sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, the depressing Monday came in reality too. The Monday right after Sunday would always be depressing! And of course, as a second year high schooler, I had to attend class.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like usual, I got up at just the right time where I wouldn't be late. Grandfather left a note saying 【To Itsuki. I will be going to the convenience store to get the 【Hell Scream 4】 I pre ordered. Fuhaha.】 and had left the house. Pre orders could be made at the convenience store nearby, and at 7am on the release day… or even 6.30am in some cases, the merchandize could be collected. It was faster than pre ordering online.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want to play 【Hell Scream 4】 too, I thought as I went out.</p>
<p class="null-p">To get to Honami High School, I will need to take a train and walk 10 minutes from the station. My school life that was the same as last week begun. Although Kazuya who was single like me last week found a girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">I already greeted several people before I reached my classroom. Second year Class two, the middle of the row next to the window was my seat. Gon-chan who was seated before me said with a serious expression:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Kazuya's head is filled with flowers now. Talking with him on【Smile】 is a pain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you saying, Gon-chan? You went through the same thing..."</p>
<p class="null-p">But he got better. Gon-chan acted that way in the past too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like I said, call me Yamai…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And my chair leaned back because of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah! That's dangerous! Don't use your Iron Claw! It couldn't be helped since I spend a much longer time calling you Gon-chan! Didn't everyone call you that when we were in our first year!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's in the past!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That might be so, but it wasn't that long ago. Gon-chan wanted others to call him Yamai just a few months ago. When Golden Week just started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sonoda-chan didn't mind it either and calls you Gon-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gon-chan sounds so lame!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sigh…."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I grunted unhappily, we got interrupted-- by Kazuya who said with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning you two! By the way, Nami-chan she..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He started showing off his love life. Long. That's too long, Kazuya! Gon-chan gave me a look that says "Do something about this". "You do something about him" I deflected right back at him-- Then, I remembered that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wasn't this just like that game last night…</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I want a girlfriend too."</p>
<p class="null-p">I muttered. Immediately after that, Gon-chan looked at me with sympathetic eyes and said:</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about joining the archery club now? There are plenty of single beauties there. Especially that freshman. What's her name again…? Mo… No, Ta…"</p>
<p class="null-p">--【Friend A】 said these lines.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You think someone like me whose experience without a girlfriend is equal to my age can introduce a nice girl to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what Kazuya said. I heard that from 【Friend B】 when I played the game app 【There are no heroines in my youth】 last night.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bell rang. Kazuya returned to his seat while Gon-chan leaned forward. The homeroom teacher entered the room and Homeroom began. This was the usual scene. Morning class began with the first period being History B. Second period was Conversational English II.</p>
<p class="null-p">Third period was chemistry…</p>
<p class="null-p">And then fourth period, Modern Literature B. I looked at the clock hanging right above the blackboard.</p>
<p class="null-p">40 minutes had passed. Class would be over in 5 minutes. My eyes</p>
<p class="null-p">fell on my phone that was in vibration mode, hidden behind my open textbook. On the screen was the app 【There are no heroines in my youth】. The countdown timer was proceeding steadily. I could continue to play during lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">"These are the handouts. Next class, we will write poems using what we learned today. Aside from the textbook, I have chosen some old and new poems you can reference, so read it at your own time."</p>
<p class="null-p">The lesson would end after getting this.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took one piece from the handouts Gon-chan gave me, and passed it behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, everybody got one… There is still some time left huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">The teacher surveyed the classroom after checking his watch. I looked out the window and into the sky. The sky was so clear in the morning, but it had gotten cloudy?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Present!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood up with a start. Could it be…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Read out the first poem on the handout."</p>
<p class="null-p">I picked up the handout hurriedly. It was a poem, so there wasn't much words or difficult kanji. I read on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Bon, Bori…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two kanji that appeared made me stop. 雪洞. My avatar in that game misread it as "se tsu do u" and was corrected by the teacher.</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing the poem, I sat back down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well done, Tosa. Thank you. Good job on reading 雪洞 correctly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Has everyone heard the song about lighting the bon buri? In Kanji, that's 雪洞. A illumination device like a lantern. By the way, 雪洞 can be read in other ways like "se tsu do u" or "se tto u", which means completely different things..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I got it right, but my avatar in 【There are no heroines in my youth】 read it wrong and was corrected.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-- If that was the case, then it had credibility… This game could really predict the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">What the game described was my future in reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Friend A】 was Gon-chan, 【Friend B】 was Kazuya. If I didn't know about it beforehand through the game, I would have made the same mistake when I was picked to read out loud during the fourth period.</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar in the game 【Tosa Itsuki】-- Was undoubtedly me. Which means-"Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">If I kept playing 【There are no heroines in my youth】, I will be able to meet my heroine in real life too!</p>
<p class="null-p">The heroine I haven't met yet!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuha! Hahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I expressed my brimming happiness by laughing out loudly. It was rude of me to dismiss you as spam mail and low tech. 【There are no heroines in my youth】 was the best!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hey-- Itsuki…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gon-chan turned and looked at me with fearful eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I regained my composure. Before I knew it, the fourth period had ended.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was lunch break. My next course of action would be…? According to the game, I would head to the snack shop and buy bread. I took my velcro wallet from my bag hanging beside my table and checked its content. It would be a critical blow if I didn't have enough money. If that happened, I would need to borrow from Gon-chan or Kazuya. There was one thousand yen note in there, perfect.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gon-chan!" I stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, oh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm going to the snack shop!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ahh… I will be eating with Akari..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, Okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I gave a thumbs up with a smile. I couldn't hold back anymore and ran to the snack shop. After buying Yakisoba bun and Teriyaki-egg bread, I returned to class 2-2.</p>
<p class="null-p">What awaited me in the classroom was just like the development in the game, Gon-chan and Kazuya were both gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for me, I went back to my seat, took out a bottle of tea I brought from home and started eating the bread I purchased. I bit into my Yakisoba bun, listened to the chatter around me and focused on the screen on my phone that was on the center of my desk. When I finished all my bread, there was just one minute left.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was lunch break after all… I could turn on the volume, but it would be better to keep it down. I basically kept it on vibrate in school, but I turned off that setting when the game began.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- The countdown was over.</p>
<p class="null-p">I started tapping the screen anxiously. With the start of the BGM, the screen changed from its countdown mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar attended Mathematics II in the fifth period, and school ended after physical education in the sixth period.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for the time before lunch break ended where I was playing 【There are no heroines in my youth】, the narration described it as 【Tosa Itsuki played a game】.</p>
<p class="null-p">It only state the necessary, and the game proceeded by cutting out anything unimportant. Well, if it displayed all the chatter, teacher's script and action, it would be a huge wall of text.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in the game, I wasn't picked by the teacher in the afternoon classes or did anything outstanding for physical education, making it through peacefully. This was exactly how my everyday life was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Up til now, the only characters that debut with a portrait were</p>
<p class="null-p">【Friend A】and 【Friend B】… Which were guys… This was horrible.</p>
<p class="null-p">School was finally out now. My avatar finally started action!</p>
<p class="null-p">The third choice branch appeared! I could finally, finally! Meet with the heroine, right!? And it would be my heroine, right!?</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when I saw the first and second… options, my finger hovering above the screen started trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Hurry home and play the latest FPS【Hell Scream 4】 with your</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandfather.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Invite Tsugawa from the soccer club and Takeda from the archery club to the school library.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Pull a recycle bag over your head and jump from the roof of one building to the next.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The first option was just like my style. In fact, Grandpa went out this morning to collect his pre ordered game. The game title stating 【Hell Scream 4】 made 【There are no heroines in my youth】 even more convincing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving that aside, huh? This was the only practical choice, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">The second option-- What the hell? This was an option that appeared because it was tied to reality. Tsugawa and Takeda were boys from class 2-2 as well. Their clubs were as stated too. I wasn't really friends with them, but we had chatted before. However, I was fundamentally different from them as a human. As for why, it's because the two of them were handsome! They were normies -- It wasn't impossible to invite them, but that place wouldn't do. Tsugawa hated studying, and the library was like hell to him. Takeda had the tendency to visit the washroom often when he went to the library. Both of them avoided the library like the plague.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could choose this if this was just a game. But that wasn't the case… If I chose it, I would need to carry it out in real life. Even if I just invite only one of them, it would be tough getting them to agree to visit the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">The third option wasn't even worth thinking about. It was the same option again! I won't even consider it, who would do something like that!?</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Which means.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tap on 【Hurry home and play the latest FPS【Hell Scream 4】 with your Grandfather.】</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar then went home just like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When my avatar reached home, the third character with a portrait after 【Friend A】 and 【Friend B】 appeared!</p>
<p class="null-p">-- It was my Grandpa…</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar and 【Itsuki's Grandpa】 played 【Hell Scream 4】 happily. In a blink of an eye, we spent the night playing the game. I learned that 【Hell Scream 4】 was very well made.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then the screen turned black. It started counting down. The game for this time-- had ended for now. "Ehh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, was this really fine?</p>
<p class="null-p">【Hell Scream 4】 was well made and seemed interesting, so I would definitely have fun playing it. In fact, that was what happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the problem was...</p>
<p class="null-p">-- The most important selling point of 【There are no heroines in my youth】, where was the heroine?</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't appear!</p>
<p class="null-p">The first day was ending? Wasn't this a game that last just five days?</p>
<p class="null-p">One fifth of it was over. My avatar was already home. It was night. I didn't have plans to go out, right? Wait, maybe I will go out late at night? Maybe the next game could be played at that timing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let's leave that for later…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Blow them up with the M203 grenade! Woah! My blood is boiling! Itsuki, I will leave that side to you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now was Monday, 26th September evening in reality. Grandpa and I were immersed in the co-op mode of the foreign-made FPS game 【Hell·Scream 4】.</p>
<p class="null-p">The main character that descended into hell kept killing the humans that had turned into revolting monsters, and got into a final battle with a god. That was the common point in the series.</p>
<p class="null-p">The console was connected to a 55-inch 4k television Grandpa bought at a high price. 4k was the best after all, the graphics was on another level. On such a graphic settings, the models were almost indistinguishable from reality. The sound effect was epic because of the headphones. The footsteps of the enemy could be heard, and even the directions they were coming from.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, we played nonstop for about two hours.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I thought this series was dead after the third game… I only bought 4 out of respect for the masterpiece that 1 was. Something like placing flowers before a grave, and a tiny bit of expectations when I pre ordered it… But 【Hell·Scream】 franchise has revived like the phoenix in its fourth iteration!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa who got out of the deadly battle before me said leisurely as he took out the enemy. However…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was surrounded by the enemy. Should I use the precious custom smoke rounds I have been stashing…? But I might need it later…</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe a worse situation would come up…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuki, don't be stingy and use it. Just like me, Itsuki! You will die if you just horde it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noisy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, I didn't use the smoke grenade to get through that part. Grandpa would not hesitate to use the rare weapons he come across, but I was the type who would stash it carefully… On the other hand! Using weak weapons to fight would improve my skills, so there was nothing wrong with that!</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing that I made it through that stage, Grandpa took off his headphones.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about ordering take outs for dinner? I have some vouchers and feel like getting "Pizza-La"[3]"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm okay with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even at this age, Grandpa was still an old man who welcome junk food at anytime.</p>
<p class="null-p">I picked up my phone which I had placed on the coffee table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you want to order, Grandpa? I'm fine with anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">"【Gluttony Cheesy Autumn Mushroom Pizza】 and 【Assorted Stew Style Pizza】. Hand tossed for both."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger."</p>
<p class="null-p">I placed the call via phone quickly and told Grandpa:</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will be here in about 30 minutes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's take a break before the pizza comes. After eating, let's play more 【Hell·Scream 4】! Any objections, Itsuki?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nope. There wasn't any but… Huh? Was this really fine?</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at my phone and tap on the icon for 【There are no heroines in my youth】. The countdown for the next game came out. There was still 5 hours 3 minutes and 11 seconds left.</p>
<p class="null-p">And things happened just like in the game, and that was because I made the same choices. After school, I immediately went home and played 【Hell·Scream 4】 eagerly with Grandpa. It was almost 8pm at night. And so, the first day was ending in real life too.</p>
<p class="null-p">I already asked this plenty of times today-- Where's the heroine?</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the heroine aside, there wasn't even a portrait of a girl yet. And of course none appeared in real life too.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Which means, I chose the wrong option for the game?</p>
<p class="null-p">Could it be, I shouldn't choose the usual bland and normal options like I usually do?</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Yes! That must be it!</p>
<p class="null-p">I realized too late…! I covered my face with one palm. Seemed like I need to take actions that differed from usual…! If this went on, my heroine would probably never appear…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Grandpa."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will be going back to my room after eating pizza."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What about 【Hell Scream 4】? The story is interesting, this is the remake of the original version."</p>
<p class="null-p">He asked me with a shocked expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">I understand Grandpa. I thought so too… If possible, I want to play 【Hell Scream 4】 for the entire night. Until yesterday, I would definitely do so! But not now!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Grandpa… I… decided to make the heroine appear!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I bade farewell to my former self.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2. Taking Flight in my Search for a Heroine</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Tuesday, an hour past midnight. The game countdown reached 0. It was time to play 【There are no heroines in my youth】. Up until just now, I received 【Smile】 messages from Gon-chan and Kazuya, but I replied them all with emoticons, and blocked off all distractions.</p>
<p class="null-p">I sat on my bed cross legged, and held my phone in my hands tightly. Come on!</p>
<p class="null-p">It started after my Grandpa and I finished playing 【Hell Scream 4】. After that, the narration stated I "played a mobile game" and my avatar went to bed. I already expected that… Nothing, nothing happened at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which meant the outrageous event of meeting a heroine in the middle of the night didn't happen!</p>
<p class="null-p">Which also meant I wasted one precious day!</p>
<p class="null-p">The strength drained from me. The second day… I will work hard on the second day!</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar reached the school. Chatted idly with 【Friend A】 and 【Friend B】 in the classroom. The class schedule for Tuesday was exactly the same as mine in real life. The first to fourth period was described in narrative form. Nothing of note happened. Next was lunch break. Here it comes! The choice branch appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Buy bread at the snack shop.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Puppurapu?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Head to the second courtyard】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Puppura……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Instruction manual… Don't this game have an instruction manual? There should be one, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, that settings icon in the top right corner of the screen still couldn't be used! Just why? Or will it remain locked if no heroine appears…? That might be the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">Treating this as seriously as my final exams, I started working my brain. Buying bread at the snack shop… I want to choose this! Even so, probably nothing would change if I did! Which means this was a wrong choice. Just like the usual me!</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't get the Puppura thing at all… Was my avatar supposed to say that? Or would I hear it in the game? Wait, even though I would know what that was after choosing it, I didn't have the option of saving and loading. I couldn't retry my choices! Should I choose that Puppura thing in spite of all that? That was too risky…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Next would be the second courtyard. At first glance, this seems like a normal option. But that wasn't impossible, it's a trap. Honami High School have two courtyards, one was grand, the other was deserted. During lunch, groups of friends and couples would spend their time there, building a nice atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other hand, the furnishing in the second courtyard seemed really haphazard, and it was also small. It was also related to the supernatural side of Honami High School, being part of the 7 school mysteries. It wasn't popular, and the lighting was bad too.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was the content of the mystery. Apparently, singles who visited the second courtyard during lunch break will remain a bachelor for all three years of high school. Just for visiting that place during lunch break! By the way, the same rumours said that couples would break up if they went there. This seemed to have originated from a curse by an unpopular male student a long time ago who ate in the second courtyard… For those who didn't mind such things, this might be a nice quiet place. As for me, I didn't really want to visit there…</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah. But, I could only choose this…</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was a place I would never visit, maybe something would happen there…</p>
<p class="null-p">I sent my avatar to the second courtyard. I chose the third option.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was filled with doubt as I watch my avatar moved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oohhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But I saw it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, it's finally here! I 【Heroine A?】 appeared in the name slot of the dialogue box… Wait. Why was there a 【?】? What the hell was that 【?】!</p>
<p class="null-p">Hold on, a girl with a portrait appeared! The first one!</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a bit late, but I was finally heading in the right track! And wasn't that--.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Mochizuki Rika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her long brown hair with a curl at the very tip that came right down to her chest. She had put in quite a bit of effort! The sway of her hair and breasts were well done. The colouring and air about her was great, an excellent portrait of the real life Rika-sama. The dialogue box-- also showed that Heroine A's name was Mochizuki Rika.【Heroine A? Mochizuki Rika】.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the reflection of the result of the data I entered.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reference for the first person was Rika-sama.…… in terms of her looks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama appeared with an unhappy expression. My avatar didn't notice Rika-sama. Shortly later, my avatar picked up a lost item. Was it Rika-sama's? It wasn't stated what that item was, but my avatar spoke to Rika-sama. Go for it!</p>
<p class="null-p">【E-E-E-Erm!】</p>
<p class="null-p">I stared at the screen speechless. If I could only… But it was true that if I spoke to a girl, and Rika-sama on top of that, I would become like that. I would become like that! Yeah, I knew that!</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar offered the lost item to Rika-sama.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Rika-sama's expression completely disappeared. I understand. She completely hates me now, right? Just why!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama quickly turned her back to me and left.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- That was my meeting with 【Heroine A?】, the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh-……Ehh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait a minute. But I couldn't interfere with what was happening on the screen. I was moved to tears that someone that seemed to be a Heroine appeared. And that person was that Rika-sama! While it was true that we met, it was negative in nature…</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar didn't give his name to Rika-sama. Rika-sama didn't say anything either. Rika-sama's portrait was wonderful, the swaying of her hair and breasts were so detailed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was Rika-sama's entire screen time? Really?</p>
<p class="null-p">I should continue the game. I tapped it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Rika-sama's debut ended just like that… My avatar brought the lost item to buy bread. After buying the bread scheduled for Tuesday, I had lunch in the classroom. I then attended the fifth and sixth period. -- And so, school was out for the second day.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should make a move here! Just like lunch break… and pick an action where I could at least meet my heroine!</p>
<p class="null-p">The choice branch's here!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Hurry home and play the new FPS 【Hell Scream 4】 with your grandfather, and chat with other players.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Head to the library.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Pull a recycle bag over your head and jump from the roof of one building to the next.】</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any puppura thing this time… it was fine that the puppura stuff was gone… There was some slight changes with the first option, but it was basically the same thing as yesterday. My finger started hovering between the second and third options, unable to decide between the library and the roof top.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I head to the library… Well, compared to the first option, it wasn't something I would usually do, but it appeared too reasonable. That might be so, but jumping from the roof top… that option was too ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Isn't this option too persistent?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I suddenly realized that this option already appeared several times. That means something would happen if I select it, right? A heroine would appear!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait… the problem is..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Was the rooftop accessible? If yes, what about the distance to the next block? How far was it? Was it within jumping range?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">I crossed my arms as I listened to the game's BGM. Wasn't it still too early to make my decision? The game progressed all the way to the end of school on the second day. There was still plenty of time until then. It would be fine to make that choice after I go to school. Speaking of which, after meeting Rika-sama during lunch break, the game narrates me as playing a game as I ate bread in class. It was mentioned off handedly, but I should have made my choice during that time, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">That must be the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded and decided to postpone the selection to later… And turned in.</p>
<p class="null-p">I slept soundly until I woke by myself on Tuesday, 27th September. I spent the morning in school distractedly. Gon-chan and Kazuya chatted with me, but I didn't remember the details. I think… Kazuya was complaining about me replying to his 【Smile】 messages with just emoticons. I used the excuse that I was engrossed with 【Hell Scream 4】 to fudge over it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gon-chan usually sends emoticons, so answering back with emoticons wasn't a problem. When I conversed with Gon-chan through 【Smile】, it had become common to respond to him with an emoticon. Kazuya will probably get used to it soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bell signalling the end of the fourth period rang. I stood up abruptly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The encounter with Rika-sama was waiting for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I headed for the second courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">To think that Rika-sama would appear in that kind of place. If not for the help of 【There are no heroines in my youth】, I would never have thought of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a well-known rumour about Rika-sama heading to a secret location to have lunch. People who wanted to be her servants and flatter her would follow Rika-sama everywhere. But this probably crossed her limits of tolerance. She said: 【Annoying! Disappear!】</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, no one knew where Rika-sama would go during lunch break-- that's how the rumour goes. There were rumours saying that she would spend that time being lovey dovey with the guy she fancies, or discipline students she dislikes. That rumour was too much, and probably stem from the other legend about several female students who transferred fearfully after being glared at by Rika-sama. By the way, I couldn't believe anyone would transfer just for that and dismiss it as just a rumour.</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked down the stairs to the first floor. The second courtyard was a bit far from classroom 2-2.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After reaching this place, I started to shiver. Now that I was here, it really felt like some strange things would pop out. It was a bit cold here. The leaves of the almond tree was still green at this season, and it felt a little gloomy.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was great that I got here.</p>
<p class="null-p">I shift my gaze downwards, and searched the area. After all, my avatar picked something up here. How could I miss the chance to chat with Rika-sama, correct!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, that rock with a weird shape? It wasn't a lost item, so that's wrong. Oh, that chocolate snack packaging? How could it be. Don't throw rubbish here, okay?</p>
<p class="null-p">I picked up the packaging, and headed to the school trash bin located in a corner of the school courtyard. A trash bin was right here, yet this was still littered, really now… As a campus beautification committee member, I couldn't turn a blind eye to this!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">My gaze stopped at the white object in the shadow of the trash bin… It was a small doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…… Rubbish?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was hard to judge. It was a bit damaged as if it had been thrown away, but was that really so? However, I could feel the love its owner put into it, so what's with that. I picked the palm sized tail-shaped doll up. It was fluffy and white, and appeared to be in too good a condition for something that was discarded. It also had signs of repair. There was also a pink lacy strap at the end, which was a little dirty… It smelled clean when I brought it near my nose… So it's probably not trash.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should send this to the teacher's office as a lost item.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned around-- and opened my eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ri... it's Rika-sama. Rika-sama's here! Damn! I was distracted by the love being emitted by the tail doll! She had a 【?】, but this was still an encounter with a heroine!</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama in the flesh was just a few metres away…! Rika-sama in real life was different from the game after all!</p>
<p class="null-p">She was searching for something with a serious face. Why was her frowning face so beautiful too. Not cute, but beautiful. Rika-sama seemed flustered as she brushed her hair up.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- I finally came to my senses here.</p>
<p class="null-p">W-W-W-What should I do?</p>
<p class="null-p">I haven't found the lost item my avatar picked up yet, right!? There was no way it could be this tail. It obviously didn't belong to Rikasama! Or rather, it seemed to be something she would throw away.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if I took this lost item, and ask her "Does this belong to you?", I should be able to chat with Rika-sama. There wasn't any time for me to hesitate and pick something else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just treat this tail as the lost item my avatar found in the game, and proceed from here…!</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I won't yell 【A-Ahhhhhhh!】 like my avatar did! Absolutely not! The important thing was timing,</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was thinking about that, Rika-sama walked closer. She was looking at the ground and seemed to be muttering something I couldn't hear. W-Was this the right time? Should I start speaking here--?</p>
<p class="null-p">I took a step forward. The sound of my foot stepping on the sandy ground echoed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama lifted her head as if she was shocked. She looked at me with her determined eyes. This was the first time I saw Rika-sama's face from so close. I should say she looked like a porcelain doll. A well proportioned face just like a doll. What was that called again, the right temperament? With a little icy air about her. Rika-sama's eyes fell quickly onto the tail doll on my hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama's expression vanished completely. I understood what a horrifying thing it was for a beauty to become expressionless.</p>
<p class="null-p">My mind turned blank and I --</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ahhhhhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Made the same mistake as my avatar! And offered the tail doll to Rika-sama meaninglessly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Rika-sama's reaction?</p>
<p class="null-p">She's glaring at me ahhh!</p>
<p class="null-p">Was this the eye power that made those students transfer?</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama then turned away immediately. I couldn't do anything but watch Rika-sama's back as she walked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhhhhh. This was just like the game, but… this sensation of failure…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huhh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I started sniffing. A nice fragrance was coming from the direction where Rika-sama had left. It was what I smelled earlier. I looked at the tail in my outstretched hand, and brought it to my nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The same smell…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was only speculation, but this belonged to Rika-sama?</p>
<p class="null-p">Drop that at once plebeian!</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that what she meant? I turned around… Before I discarded it, should I ask Rika-sama one more time? If I want to ask…</p>
<p class="null-p">"The next chance would be after school…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I remembered that I haven't decided on the choice branch yet. I looked up at the school building like I did this morning. It seemed possible to leap from one building to the next.</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be a bit tight! Though, for people skilled in long jumping, it might be possible…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Time for lunch."</p>
<p class="null-p">So I went to the snack shop. Going by my schedule for Tuesday, I bought chocolate croissant, prawn bun and butter sandwich. I returned to the classroom and ate by myself today too.</p>
<p class="null-p">But my eyes were glued to the phone on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were three choices, and I had to choose one…</p>
<p class="null-p">I had gotten tired of the BGM now. Should I go to the library, or the rooftop… If I chose rooftop, not only do I have to do a long jump, I need to put a Recycling Bag over my head too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Recycling Bag……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Coincidentally, I got a white Recycling bag of the right size when I bought bread just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after finishing all the bread, I was still stuck there. As lunch break was finishing soon, I felt it was time to end this and picked up the phone with my left hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">My right index finger hovered hesitantly millimetres above the options. How troubling…</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing, Itsuki !"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unfortunately, this was the moment I received a bump on the back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone slapped my back. But I knew who it was just from that voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woahh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">My index finger.</p>
<p class="null-p">Touched it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Touched the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aahhhhhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, were you that surprised?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I wasn't surprised ahhhh! I turned my head and saw Kazuya. Kazuya didn't realize the crime he committed and was still all smile. Damn it, instead of that, what I chose was more important!</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Because of that accident, what I chose was 【visit the library.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank god!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Safe! It was the the choice that was more typical for me. In that case… I could continue with ease. My avatar headed off to the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">However… Nothing, happened. I didn't borrow any books, and my avatar fell asleep in the library!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Tosa Itsuki sleep very soundly. It had gotten dark outside. After leaving the school, he went home.】 That's all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It then returned to the familiar black countdown screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Didn't the heroine appear? If I took the same actions that I just chose…</p>
<p class="null-p">"……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait. No, because this was closely related to the heroine, I had been taking the same actions as the game. It had been confirmed that nothing would happen if I head to the library. By going through this game, I knew that was the wrong option. In that case, I just need to take the option which I didn't select just now. The bad thing was, I wouldn't know what the results would be, but something would definitely happen! Such as encountering a heroine, a heroine encountering me or something!</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">I grabbed the Recycling Bag, on my desk, seemed like I had to use it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned to Kazuya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kazuya… Thanks!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I patted his shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really get it, but I won't reject any thanks directed at me!" My plans after school was now clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was 【Pull a recycle bag over your head and jump from the roof of one building to the next.】</p>
<p class="null-p">When the last HR class ended, the decisive after school time came and I headed for the rooftop. I left the classroom early like my other friends, although they did so to walk home with their girlfriends. How envious. No, even if it was me, if I made good use of 【There are no heroines in my youth】... I could get a girlfriend!</p>
<p class="null-p">Honami High School was divided to the east building and west building. Since class 2-2 was in the east building, I headed for the roof here first… But the door was locked. I held onto a glimmer of hope and went to the west building-- And the door to the roof was actually open!</p>
<p class="null-p">I glanced through the door, and stood in the stairwell instead of entering the roof.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was the rain! It was raining! It was great that the door wasn't locked, but I was pushed back to the stairwell by the rain blown in by the strong wind. I took out my phone and checked the weather app, and a storm had surrounded the area around school. The rain had the chance of turning into hail… Hail?</p>
<p class="null-p">I have to complete the challenge of jumping from one rooftop to another under such weather?</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">I brought a Recycling Bag with me, the one that came along with my purchase of my bread… But…</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned off the weather app, and found a notification waiting for me. It was sent by 【There are no heroines in my youth】. I opened the game, and it was still displaying the countdown--</p>
<p class="null-p">Hold on! On a closer look, the icon that wouldn't respond no matter how much I pressed it had changed. The colour was different. After tapping on it, a system notification appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">【This is a notification for Tosa Itsuki-san. You can install an assistance tool now. Would you like to install an AI?】</p>
<p class="null-p">……AI? An AI would be Artificial Intelligence, right? Was it something that could be installed on a phone, depending on the phone model?</p>
<p class="null-p">【Installation will require a payment of the in-app currency of 500,000 Sols. Tosa Itsuki-san has 0 Sols on hand right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Insufficient funds, please proceed with a loan.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I remember my total possible loan amount was… 1,000,000 Sols. I already borrowed 300,000 Sols to start this game, so this would cost an additional 500,000 Sols huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">The AI actually cost more than the game itself! What in the world…</p>
<p class="null-p">My debt would grow to 800,000 Sols if I install this AI… I already borrowed 300,000… If I add another 500,000, that would be--!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine… That will be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">【The AI will provide gentle guidance to the customers who aren't</p>
<p class="null-p">familiar with the game. A powerful partner who will definitely be of use. Even if you have to take a loan, we will recommend you get one.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm… I crossed my arms, and these words appeared like a followup attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Do you require a loan?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Thank you for your patronage, Tosa Itsuki-san. You have taken a loan of 500,000 Sols, now installing the assistance tool AI. Please select gender. Would you like a male? Or female?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Female of course.</p>
<p class="null-p">【We have prepared two types of female. A young loli type, default name Minari. Voice sample-- "I love Onii-chan!"】 "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The anime-like voice from the phone made me lean back in surprise. This was the first time I heard a voice from this game.</p>
<p class="null-p">【The elder sister type who is about your age. Default name Pandora. Voice sample--"I will always be on your side.", please choose one.】 This voice sound more reassuring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which should I choose. What a headache… Younger sister, forgive me. With a heavy heart, I chose Pan-- Before that, I did a eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Catch a tiger by the toe. It was still Pandora. Even god wanted me to choose Pandora!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Please choose either positive or negative as Pandora's personality setting.】</p>
<p class="null-p">What good was there in doing this? Optimistic and Pessimistic huh… Couldn't go wrong with being cheerful right. Positive!</p>
<p class="null-p">【The setting for your personal AI is complete. Now initializing.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I waited for the phone screen to load, and a voice appeared along with words on the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Nice to meet you, Itsuki, I am Pandora. How may I assist you?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nice to meet you… Pandora?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The AI spoke very fluently. Since I wasn't talking to a human girl, I didn't mess up at all. I wasn't tense at all!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes, how do you do. Please address me in any way you prefer.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The reply was immediate. Address her anyway I like huh? In that case…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Okay.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I was permitted to address her with chan! How long had it been since I addressed a girl with chan…? Kindergarten?</p>
<p class="null-p">"【I will always be on your side】 huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was just like the voice sample. How gentle. You are really gentle, Pandora-chan!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes, I will always be on your side. My ideal and dream is to help those with hikikomori tendencies and trouble with communication. That is the impression the program developer had of me.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora, I wished you had kept that secret from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Something like how idols didn't need to use the toilet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【I guess?】</p>
<p class="null-p">I changed my mindset.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I ask questions?"</p>
<p class="null-p">From our earlier conversation, I understand that Pandora's capability was high, and idle chatter was possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Please do.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"【There are no heroines in my youth】 is an app that can predict the future and help me to encounter heroines, correct?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I think that should be so, but I hope someone could confirm that.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Correct. This is a game that provide hints by predicting the encounter with the opposite sex. Since the catch phrase is 【A Heroine that only belongs to you】, Itsuki also realize that right…? But】</p>
<p class="null-p">"But?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a bit hesitant.</p>
<p class="null-p">【For Itsuki's case, you have not confirmed a single heroine yet.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't ignore that, Pandora-chan!</p>
<p class="null-p">"……A heroine appeared, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama! Even though it was just for a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">【You mean Heroine A, right?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes!</p>
<p class="null-p">【But there is a 【?】 behind A right?】</p>
<p class="null-p">…Hmm?</p>
<p class="null-p">【If the 【?】 is still there, she will not be a heroine. Please ensure you get at least one heroine in 5 days. You also took a loan, so the best would be to follow the progression of the game.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Up until now, I didn't realize that at all…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Remove the 【?】…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Please work hard, Itsuki .】</p>
<p class="null-p">I grabbed the Recycling Bag in my pocket tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first day ended without the heroine even appearing. Although I met Rika-sama on the second day afternoon for real, it was still really terrible! I couldn't let the time after school end fruitlessly today just like yesterday…!</p>
<p class="null-p">I opened the door to the rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">With my phone in my right hand, and a folded white Recycling Bag in my left.</p>
<p class="null-p">Huge droplets of rain blown by the wind hit my face painfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I chose this option in the game, would my avatar make the jump successfully despite such conditions? "Erm~"</p>
<p class="null-p">I lowered my body and asked my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes, is there any problem?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Not too stiff or too encumbered by politeness, Pandora maintained a perfect balance as she replied with a mechanical tone. She was already given a personality, they might as well display her as a portrait on the phone. They really skimped on this detail.</p>
<p class="null-p">I brought up the biggest problem.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's raining, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes it is.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The weather was deteriorating. And the rain was turning into hail.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood at the edge of the roof, one step away from falling. There wasn't any fences here… I looked down. It was 10-- No, much taller. It was definitely 12 or 13 metres high… Really high. I was breaking out in cold sweats… Ugh. I-I will die from this height. The newspaper headline of a male student in the second year of high school jumping off a building in suicide appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The distance between the rooftops was about 3 metres.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was possible to cover it with a long jump. But the mentality behind jumping with a running start on the field and on the rooftop was completely different. And under such horrible weather too.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Alright, please prepare yourself and then jump.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring my wavering, Pandora-chan said that to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Listen Pandora-chan! Reality is not like the movies!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I extended my left hand holding the recycling bag to point at the field and protested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Only a protagonist can survive after acting recklessly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki is a protagonist too.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the case of 【There are no heroines in my youth】 I am the protagonist-- Not! The truth is, I'm just a normal guy! There is a higher chance that I will fall!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Is that so? The chance of success is 70%, so it's not really too far a stretch.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Just 70%?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That definitely won't do!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm, Pandora? As an artificial intelligence, you should reject such a choice if the chances are less than 90%…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【I am programmed with an optimistic personality. I won't give an advice of caution unless the chance of success is below 30%.】</p>
<p class="null-p">30% was too low, that pretty much guarantees failure…! But I see. The assistance program had either positive or negative outlooks, and I chose the optimistic version…</p>
<p class="null-p">【You have a 70% chance, Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">T-That's right! It's 70%, wasn't it!? Yes, the odds were 70% in my favor! I should think of it that way. Because of her gentle encouragement, I also became optimistic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Alright! I'm gonna do it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Before that, please pull the Recycling Bag in your left hand over your head.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why must I wear… this thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【I don't really know either…】</p>
<p class="null-p">I used my finger to poke two holes for my eyes, one hole for my mouth, and put on the white Recycling Bag. I tied the handle part of the bag around my neck. After backing off an adequate distance for a running start, I put my right leg forward, and took a ready to sprint stance.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the preparations were done, time for the real thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-O-Okay! I'm going!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Alright, please do your best.】</p>
<p class="null-p">But I remained in place. I repeated the same lines a number of time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go..."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki. This is the seventeenth time you said that.】</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't just a few, it was already the seventeenth time.</p>
<p class="null-p">【-- Would you like to give up?】</p>
<p class="null-p">This was definitely not an accusatory tone. It felt considerate, with a hint of sympathy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I won't give up..."</p>
<p class="null-p">After being told that so kindly, I felt that I had to continue no matter how stubborn I was. I placed my phone in my chest pocket. I only dragged for so long because I kept saying "Go! Go!" So I took a stance, and proceeded in silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, it would be running start, jump and land!</p>
<p class="null-p">I maintain my composure, started running, and immediately-jumped!!</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh shit. Oh shit oh shit oh shit. It was an obviously failed jump. I slowed down in order to not run over the edge, but my jump was too weak! Even though I realized that, my body couldn't stop. I flail my arms at the dark clouds. It was just a short distance, but the rooftop on the other building seemed so far away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after that--</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't get a grip on it ahhh!</p>
<p class="null-p">My hands had a death grip on the edge of the roof, and I somehow got my elbows over the edge too. However, my hand would slip on the concrete that had turned wet from the rain. I was slowly slipping off, and the hail rained down on me like stones. The plastic bag over my face made it a little difficult to breathe, and I was suffocating. If I fell off, I wouldn't just die, and would be seen as a perverted high schooler wearing a Recycling Bag over his head! I wouldn't rest in peace!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is anyone there! Help ahhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Help!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is anyone there!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I prayed that someone was here and shouted.</p>
<p class="null-p">My arms on the edge of the roof was slipping off. I had to rely on myself, damn it!</p>
<p class="null-p">The worst case scenario flashed through my mind. It would probably be hard for this to be seen as an accident. Would it be treated as suicide? Since I fell off the building in such bad weather with a Recycling Bag over my head. The scene of the interview appeared in my head. Gon-chan whose eyes got covered by a censor bar would say: 【That guy… Is really frustrated about not having a girlfriend...】 or something. Kazuya whose eyes were censored the same way would say: 【Even I, the last member of the no-girlfriend league also got one recently… Maybe it's because of that...】 or something!</p>
<p class="null-p">Uwah, I don't want to die like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Pandora! Can you think of something!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I sought help from the phone in my front pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can't you hear me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【I can hear you.】</p>
<p class="null-p">It was muffled by the rain, but I definitely heard Pandora's voice. Unlike me, she sounded very calm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Answer me! Answer!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Do you want to know the probability of you falling?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who cares! Survive! Chance of surviving! Things about surviving!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Continuing conversation, please work hard for a while longer.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't! I can't! How long is a while longer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【… Just a while longer.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no way I can understand how long that is!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Please, Pandora-chan! No, I'm really begging you. I'm putting the most effort in my life to hold on to the edge, my arms are starting to shake. I think I am at my limits... "Grab on tight! Recycling Bag-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">R-Recycling Bag-san?</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone was heading my way. I opened my eyes in surprise, and saw a female student who was drenched grabbing my hand and pulling me up. My cry for help that took all my strength reached her, and I finally climbed up.</p>
<p class="null-p">So it felt so awesome for my hands and feet to be on solid ground… I was jumping for the rooftop on the other building, and I was standing there right now. I tried to catch my breath with all my hands and feet on the ground, but during this time, the sound of footsteps were getting further away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The footfalls stopped. There was something like a shed on this rooftop. The female student seemed to have walked behind the shed and was peeking at me, showing just a little bit of her face… I knew her. Was I mistaken? Because the air about her was…</p>
<p class="null-p">When I approached, she shirked away.</p>
<p class="null-p">……Like a stray cat who realized I was looking her way, she would run away quickly when I drew near. That sort of feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm not scary, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I only realized when I said so that I was very suspicious. A Recycling Bag man or something. But she poked her head out again, and didn't shirk away this time. Yes-- it was a face of a female student. I want to look closer, but I couldn't see clearly, so I shook off the water on the Recycling Bag. The hail on my body had turned back to rain water. My vision cleared, and I wasn't mistaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">The corners of the female student's eyes were a little red. Could it be, she was crying? But I couldn't touch her… The female student asked:</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Recycling Bag-san, are you hurt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No! Not at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she saw me shake my hand firmly, the female student smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's wonderful."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at her smile that was as sweet as honey, I began doubting my eyes. Did I get the wrong person? Twins? A Doppelganger?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm, Recycling Bag-san. You will get drenched if you stand outside, if you don't mind, please come here..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The female student pointed to the shed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Erecting a building on the rooftop was popular in this decade. Especially with the changes in the law, it was easier for Japan to build such buildings. And so, there was more buildings that would erect a luxurious penthouse. Even if they didn't go that far, they would probably erect a shed for storage. However, I never paid attention to the roof of the school building, so I didn't realize the existence of the shed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry to intrude."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was then ushered in.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eh, what was with this? The shed was about the size of 6 tatami. It look like a shed from the outside, but wasn't so from the inside. It was a beautiful room. A lounge? Or the activity room of a club? There were chairs and a table. Only one was being used, the other was placed in a corner. The female student passed the chair in the corner to me, and I was sitting on it right now. Snacks and beverages were placed on the table. Next would be the bookshelf, it seemed to be for personal use? And the atmosphere in its entirety seemed very exquisite. Because the snacks on the table didn't look like products found inside supermarkets. It was obviously a merchandize from high class outlets and retailers.</p>
<p class="null-p">I borrowed a towel to dry my drenched clothes. But I still wore my Recycling Bag. When I make a move to take it off, the female student mumbled "Are you taking it off?" a little anxiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">She sighed in relief when I shook my head weakly.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the female student wiped her own uniform, she didn't have anything pressing to do and sat back into her seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, silence. The silence continued. Something serious happened which broke this silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">My stomach started rumbling.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was great that I had a Recycling Bag over my face. She probably didn't see me blush! If possible, I hope to fudge this through!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm… Recycling Bag-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I'm a recycling bag! Please don't hold back, call me Regist[1]!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhhh. What the hell was I saying ahhhh!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san, right."</p>
<p class="null-p">The female student nodded forthrightly. She picked up the square box with cookies inside and offered them to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I only have some Wonder Treasure from 【Marie Belle】... Do you mind? There are a variety of cookies."</p>
<p class="null-p">This was probably a high class delicacy from a famous brand. Was it fine to give them to me? While I was hesitating, she stared at me uneasily. The female student slouched her shoulders meekly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will eat them! I will eat them gratefully!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I answered casually. It was a bit hard to eat them because of the Recycling Bag, but when I bit into the cookie--</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Delicious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the handmade taste that satisfied my cheap tongue. I kept reaching for more, and had tasted one of each before I knew it. The silver tin had 10 types of cookies. Especially this one… it's call a nougat or something, right? The one made from sugar. I was enamoured by the wonderful taste of almond and chocolate. So I reached for another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, thank you"</p>
<p class="null-p">I took the steaming cup of tea that was brought to me from the side. It was black tea. It warmed my body. I finally came to my senses after gorging myself with cookies and tea. My face turned green. What a gaffe, that was rude of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I placed the tea onto the table slowly, and pushed the box of cookies I pulled over to my side back to the female student. The diminishing amount of cookies could literally be seen clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that enough?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The smiling female student who didn't seem upset at all-- No matter how I looked at her, she was Rika-sama.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside my head that was nodding, the sense of dissonance made my head tilt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mochizuki Rika had a well-proportioned face looked that looked a little strict. Her long brown hair was wet right now, and gave an erotic feeling. Even when I got drench, I was just a wet pubic hair. On the other hand, Rika-sama's drenched hair felt so erotic. That was how Rika-sama looked like. But her attitude and the way she spoke was completely different…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are, Mochizuki…Rika-sa--san, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was better not to address her as Rika-sama. Maybe talking to Rikasama was so impactful that I didn't stutter. Or maybe because my face was covered. Staying anonymous played an important part too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you know about me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama lowered her head. Her eyelashes were really long. Only a handful of students in Honami High School don't know about Rikasama. That was how famous she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I heard about your rumours often..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Just for reference, what kind of rumours are they?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The rumours says, she had several boyfriends as if that was natural. She even said something about the boys that got selected should feel honoured. She won't even say "I'm sorry" to boys who confessed to her. Recently, Rika-sama preferred boys who were younger than her. If it was not someone she acknowledge, she would always give curt answers. She would ignore all plebeians. "……Ugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama lowered her head and covered her face with her palms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's not true…! I-I'm just extremely afraid of strangers!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She stood up suddenly. But her actions remain refined.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it is someone like Regist-san, I will be able to converse normally!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which means… As long as it's not human?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, I got it wrong. She probably meant if she couldn't see the other person's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh! Regist-san isn't human? That's why…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And Rika-sama believed me like that? Was she that naive?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a human! Sorry! What I wanted to say was, you will be fine if you can't see my face, right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. Because Regist-san is Regist-san, so I can speak with you without getting flustered."</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed happy and smiled sweetly. With her serious face gone, Rika-sama looked so cute despite being the beautiful type. Her wet hair had a luster about them that seemed so erotic and cute! There was no way I could keep from getting mesmerized!</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected of heroine A! Although there was a 【?】. I will definitely get rid of that 【?】!</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a long journey getting to this stage, but it was worth it…</p>
<p class="null-p">-- However, her defenceless smile was shown towards Regist-san. Only because she couldn't see my face.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Wearing a Recycling Bag and jumping from the rooftop. This option had its special meaning behind it. What about the other options? Thinking back, there was eating the horrible western set meal in the cafeteria… Inviting Tsugawa and Takeda to the library… Puppura… Even Puppura…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please listen to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Rika-sama started speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed to be having a hard time in high school.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama was afraid of strangers, and extremely so. Her family-both parents and a brother three years her senior didn't seem to trigger this, but even her relatives were a no go. Cousins were out of the question too. If possible, she wish to stay home forever. She was home schooled up until middle school.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Rika-sama came from a wealthy family, the daughter of the Mochizuki capitalist family. For capitalists, they would need to attend parties and similar gatherings. It was a sort of obligation which Rikasama had been avoiding with all sorts of reasons. But how much longer could she do so?</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't step into society this way. Thinking that it wasn't good</p>
<p class="null-p">to spoil her, the one who proposed for Rika-sama to attend a normal high school was her brother who was studying in a University. He convinced the very reluctant Rika-sama to do so, and put her through serious training during spring break.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Don't tremble here! Maintain a determined attitude! You have a pretty face, so keep up the aura that could beat down any guy who approaches you!】</p>
<p class="null-p">【B-But, Onii-sama...】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Rika! Where are you looking! Look at the other party's eyes when you speak!】</p>
<p class="null-p">【I-I can't! It's scary!】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Wwhhaatt?】</p>
<p class="null-p">One day,</p>
<p class="null-p">【Rika. Why are you shutting yourself in the toilet?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【I-It's because I feel tired in my own room when onii-sama is home… Onii-sama can't bother me in the toilet, so I can calm down!】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Aaaahhhhh?】</p>
<p class="null-p">And another day,</p>
<p class="null-p">【Rika. What would you do if you met someone you know outside? For example, if you see my girlfriend--】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Girlfriend? Is it Kiyoka-sama? Or Shiori-sama?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【It doesn't matter who… Assume it's Lilla-chan then. You are not afraid of Lilla-chan, right? You happen to run into me and Lilla-chan, what will you do?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Okay! I will avoid meeting you before that of course. It doesn't matter who it is, especially if it is onii-sama, I will hide without being noticed and sneak away-- Hmm? Onii-sama, why are you making such a bitter face!】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Come. Over. And. Greet. Me.】</p>
<p class="null-p">On another day.</p>
<p class="null-p">【You installed the 【Smile】 app onto your phone, right? I installed it too, you didn't delete yours right…? Am. I. Right…? Alright, straight to the point then. What will you do if you receive a message through</p>
<p class="null-p">【Smile】?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【I don't want it to be marked as read immediately, so I will read it on the notification screen first. I will then consider carefully whether to mark it as read!】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Haaaaaahhhh? You really are… And, why do you look so proud!】</p>
<p class="null-p">On the last day of spring break. Onii-sama brought all his friends to the Mochizuki house. There were equal numbers of men and women. All of them were sociable. For the sake of matching Rika-sama.… But it didn't work at all. Rika-sama was on the verge of tears the entire time. That night, Onii-sama was very gentle towards Rika-sama. Even though he was stern all this while, his smile was as warm as Buddha's. By the way, onii-sama seemed to resemble Rika-sama a lot, like the male version of Rika-sama…so he was really handsome. I cursed at the unfairness of life in secret.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Rika, it's fine now. It is my fault for forcing you down the path of becoming a sociable lady, which is too difficult for you. To think that even I experienced my first ever defeat. I am really sorry.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Onii-sama…!】</p>
<p class="null-p">【I will teach you the ultimate tactics then. It is an undeniable fact</p>
<p class="null-p">that you will be going to high school tomorrow. So remember this three principles well and you will be fine.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【…Alright!】</p>
<p class="null-p">And here, the three principles of the Mochizuki onii-sama appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">One, don't run away when someone chat you up. You can do that if you work hard. If you can't look them in the eye, look somewhere else. Understand? If you can't look at them, look up into the sky!</p>
<p class="null-p">Two, keep your face stiff. If you relax, you will show a face on the verge of tears. Maintain your image of a cool beauty. After all, your face is the only thing that resembles mine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Three, build the image of a girl of few words. If you really had to speak, do so in short sentences. You won't be exposed that way, right? What kind of tone should you use? If you can muddle through it with a few words… then use a commanding tone. It's decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama followed these three principles faithfully. Actually, just putting it into action took all that she had. Her life in school everyday was a death battle. That was all she did, but why did such baseless rumours keep multiplying.</p>
<p class="null-p">As a result of Rika-sama adhering to the three principles, she didn't talk much to anyone, and was seen as aloft by others. She was actually suffering from destructive communication problems, but no one knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Rika-sama was a great beauty. Just her looks made her popular. But her communication problems resulted in her executing her three principles even when confessed to, becoming confused and unreactive. Some of the people who didn't want others to know they were rejected so coldly, and those who hated her for being so cute spread rumours about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which was to say, when a beauty rejects a confession, they need to be careful. I was the type who wanted to be rejected gently, like being wrapped by rice paper, and to be turned down firmly and cleanly. I know I didn't have the rights to ask for all this, but the one being rejected don't feel good either.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, the problems started accumulating like snow, and the vicious cycle resulted in the series of nefarious rumours about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Rika-sama with the exterior of a queen and the heart of a young deer was formed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be, your lunch break is…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lunch break, huh? It has been here since my second year? When… When I was in my first year, I tried hard… but..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face was as gloomy as the dark clouds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because a lot of things happened. I had enough of the people around me and stiffening my face."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama clenched the skirt on her knees tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was at my limits and wanted to withdraw from high school… But after discussing with onii-sama…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was lectured…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I wasn't surprised despite only learning about his personality through secondhand accounts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Despite all that, onii-sama said it can't be helped, and made use of the authority of the Mochizuki family to create a place where I could rest. And so, I am here in the form of a club activity, with the club room on the rooftop."</p>
<p class="null-p">The extent of onii-sama's assistance was different from normal people after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There just happened to be a room available. It seemed to be used actively three years ago as a club room, but it was converted into a storeroom. So it was refurbished and used as a club room again. Fortunately, the physics teacher Tanigaki was a friend of onii-sama, so we got his help."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So this is the place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I am the only member, and the application was submmitted under the name of 【One Person Club】!"</p>
<p class="null-p">……One Person, Club? That sounded lazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so, what are the club's activity?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the complicated and ever changing environment of this school, this club helps to maintain one's peace of mind by spending time alone. It is healing to be here, I don't need to look into the sky or force myself not to run away. I can eat my lunch leisurely too. The key to the rooftop and warehouse are held by me, so normally, no one can ever come here..."</p>
<p class="null-p">But here I was.</p>
<p class="null-p">The 【One Person Club】 was at the rooftop of the east building. If I tried the normal way, I would fail because the door was locked. That's why I needed to jump here from the western building rooftop...</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Pardon me for being blunt, Regist-san. Why are you wearing the Recycling Bag?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was understandable. Anyone would have such doubts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… It's my hobby. I feel more at ease covering my face up."</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't a complete lie. Because she didn't know I was Tosa</p>
<p class="null-p">Itsuki, I could talk to a girl without worrying too much. And it was Rika-sama here, and I was speaking with her slowly without stuttering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At ease…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama reacted at a strange part. She looked around calmly, and took a bag that looked high class based on its logo alone, and put it on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!It's true, Regist-san! It feels really calming! If I can wear this at all times…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She spread her slender arms to express her joy. Rika-sama……! Erm, there was a huge difference from the Recycling Bag I was using! Rikasama's bag didn't have any holes for her eyes and mouth! It was natural for her to feel at ease since it was completely dark!</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be dangerous for her to move around outside like this! What was she trying to do!</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no! I usually endure and don't wear it either! And if your brother finds out, he will definitely blow his top!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama sighed and took off the bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true… He will definitely learn about it through Tanigakisensei… If onii-sama finds out… It will be terrible."</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked like she imagined it a little and shivered. My impression from what she told me was that Rika-sama's brother was a scary person, and Tanigaki-sensei will even report to him… This was probably the reason why she couldn't let her guard down in front of others. Her elder brother's surveillance network…</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do your brother thinks about the rumours?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wouldn't he be angry about the such disparaging rumours against his sister?</p>
<p class="null-p">"He told me to act just like an empress then. Just how does an empress acts?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She asked with a serious expression. Her face right now matched really well with the word empress. As for its meaning… A leader that controls the school? Her brother was probably like that, but Rika-sama probably couldn't pull it off. If the rumours evolved further, it might be possible to do so within the rumours.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama removed a pair of scissors from a box on the shelf. She seemed familiar with the items placed within the room. She cut out holes deftly on the bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't wear it normally… But there's only Regist-san here, so it won't be a problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama put on the bag again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm the same as Regist-san now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama seemed satisfied, but started shaking her head for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think Regist-san has a wonderful hobby… But why did you jump from the roof? If I wasn't around..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I could already tell that Rika-sama's thoughts were heading down a dangerous direction, so I lift my hand to refute her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No! It wasn't suicide!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">T-T-Then why?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I want to meet you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Meet my heroine !</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Why would you want to do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I want you to be my heroine of course -- to be my girlfriend…! But if I said that, it would be GG. The difficulty was too high for a first meeting… I might nod and accept with a goofy smile, but Rika-sama definitely wouldn't. We finally got to know each other, what… what do I do next? This should be the moment for 【There are no heroines in my youth】 to shine, but I didn't know the right answer since I took a different action from the game!</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to be friends..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Friends. It felt weird to say this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama's intense gaze made me really nervous, so my voice got softer towards the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Or be acquintance or something…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Erm."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aaaahhhh. This was the template for failure. This must be it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We won't be friends, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Being friends was impossible after all, Rika-sama. I understand!</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's only natural."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A… Acquintance..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama seemed to be thinking about something, and asked as if she made up her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me honestly, Regist-san. Did my parents asked you to do anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was stunned. Even with the Recycling Bag on my head, the fact that I was spacing out like a dummy was obvious to Rika-sama. Rikasama's parents…? Maybe I didn't know, but I actually know them? Not at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wasn't asked to do anything! Or rather, I have never met them before… Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">For someone of Rika-sama's standing, maybe her parent's permission was needed before she could make friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Becoming acquintances, which means."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama took one step towards me. I smelled the same fragrance as this afternoon. Rika-sama was above 165cm (but below 170cm). She was taller than the 165cm I entered into the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Speaking of which, if there was no bag! If there was no bag, I would be able to admire Rika-sama's beauty from up close! I was a little excited, and Rika-sama gripped the hem of my shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san will wear a Recycling Bag whenever you meet me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ehh… So it would become like this? Rika-sama was very bad with strangers, so she couldn't talk with 【Tosa Itsuki 】. So I nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I make any mistake, will you report to Tanigaki-sensei..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"C-Can we eat lunch together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-If you don't mind!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahhh? Instead of acquaintances, wouldn't we be closer to friends? Was that really fine?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't mind! Having a relaxed meal with someone other than oniisama is already..."</p>
<p class="null-p">She stopped her sentence midway. She probably recalled something? With her hand gripping the hem of my shirt, Rika-sama shook her head slowly. The bag made rustling sound. As if she had came to her senses, she returned to her original position, and removed her hand from my shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She helped me smooth the crease on my shirt. I missed the chance to say anything, and even if I didn't, we weren't close enough for me to ask her about that. Before she saved me, Rika-sama was crying like this too, right…? Was it related to her fear of strangers…? I was concerned, but I couldn't ask… After smoothing the crease, Rika-sama lift her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- If you don't mind, can you come here tomorrow during lunch break? And dine… No, Regist-san must have plans already…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No problem at all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I would just be eating bread purchased from the snack shop anyway! Wednesday would be egg tuna sandwich set and bean paste bun!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, I will wait for you here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama bowed gracefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm inexperienced, but please take care of me from now on. I am Mochizuki Rika, Regist-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I should be the one saying that!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_10.jpg">
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3. Although It's Great that 【Heroine B】 Appeared</p>
<p class="null-p">After ending the conversation with Rika-sama and exited from the 【One Person Club】, the rain had completely stopped. The weather had suddenly turned sunny. However, Rika-sama was worried about my uniform being drenched, and stopped me from going. And of course, I didn't have a problem with her suggestion. I won't catch a cold from just this. After all, I was a top student in terms of health.</p>
<p class="null-p">First was going home, then taking a bath immediately after that. I then moved to the clean living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Picking up the phone, I tapped on the icon for 【There are no heroines in my youth】 and started the game. The countdown screen was displayed. The waiting time was exceptionally long this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">By my calculation, it would take until tomorrow morning. About 5am…? I need to get up early then. Could I get up in time? No no no, I had to get up, the time until the next game might be even longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because nothing would happen for today-- Next would be the third day, Wednesday. What would happen next? What should I do tomorrow? More importantly, will my promise to have lunch with Rika-sama pass by peacefully? Would I do anything retarded? I just can't wait.</p>
<p class="null-p">But before the future comes, I had things I needed to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was to read the instruction manual for 【There are no heroines in my youth】. After installing Pandora, I could access the instruction manual by pressing the button on the top right corner of the screen. By the way, things like saving and loading wasn't there.</p>
<p class="null-p">This game was a one way trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">I need to talk to Pandora too-- Oh right, regarding the problem about loans. The loan system and the forced reparation if I lose the game still wasn't clear. I had to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, I had already borrowed 800,000 Sols, and I was wondering what was being used as a collateral for this loan? In the beginning, I didn't pay much attention to it as it didn't involve money. But to be honest, a heroine was more important than money.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I had a feeling that this game app wasn't simple at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I start from the source-- It would be the advertising email.</p>
<p class="null-p">I opened my email app, and opened that mail from my inbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">I read that mail once again. It ended after 【Next, please tap on the below URL】... Wait, there's more? I was shocked. The scroll bar could be dragged down further. After a few lines of blank, there was a footnote in small fonts…!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Note-- In the event that an error code appears during the game, it is possible to continue to proceed with the game. But in accordance with our company policy, we will advise ending the game… Our company will not be responsible for any losses and injuries that results from continuing the game.】</p>
<p class="null-p">T-This… means that everything would be my own responsibility! Any problem that happens would be your own doing!</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Pandora!"</p>
<p class="null-p">During times of trouble, we should rely on the assistance of the excellent AI. As she was installed in my phone, I just need to call out for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes, Itsuki. Is there any problem?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"An error code occured before the game launched, but I still started the game!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I omitted all the details and stated briefly.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I understand.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm, I have an ominous feeling that something terrible like losses or injuries would happen..."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. The chance of that is 100%.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"One, one hundred percent? Not ninety nine percent? No matter what, a hundred percent is..."</p>
<p class="null-p">【No, it is 100%. That is what the appearance of the error code means. That's why we recommend terminating the game.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… That's true."</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't refute that.</p>
<p class="null-p">【But making it through the game wasn't impossible. It's just that the game… will occasionally not match up with reality… Please be prepared for that mentally, Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not match… Not match… Not"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Things will definitely work out.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Because she had an optimistic disposition, she said encouraging words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Itsuki."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was talking to Pandora-- but from the perspective of a bystander, it probably felt like I was speaking with a phone seriously, which made Grandpa ask me worriedly. I turned back, and saw Grandpa actually stopped the 【Hell Scream 4】 he liked so much, as he pondered how to phrase his question. He seemed to have decided on a fast ball.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Are you alright? You are talking to the AI voice function on your phone..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a special version! The type that could differentiate the content of a speech. Watch this. Pandora, a greeting please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Nice to meet you Grandfather, I am Pandora.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Woahh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa's eyes lit up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels great to be called Grandfather by a girl! Although one of the players in 【Hell Scream 4】 on my friendlist is a girl that feels like a granddaughter too, we will meet one day… It will be great if 【Hell Scream 4】 has voice chat function…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A girl like a granddaughter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm? It's a girl attending the same high school as you, though? She said she is in Honami High School. We were chatting just now, and I replied that it's Honami High School here too, and it will be great if we can meet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa showed me a thumbs up as if he was expressing the 'Good job' he had done! I walked towards Grandpa and bent his thumb hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That hurts! My grandson is abusing the elderly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me the details."</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa blew at his thumb exaggeratingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The details, you mean how we get to know each other? Well, you know how much of a fan I am of the 【Final Dead】 series."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Final Dead】 was set on earth and mars, an online FPS with the wide range of maps and weapons as its selling point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I started getting close with a kid called Break on the Stage Clear leaderboard. You should know about Break too. Since she was a teenage girl, I faked the details a little, and used Itsuki's identity to chat with her, fight together and duel with each other. You also played with Break on that account before, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, it's that person?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In 【Final Dead】, I will login with the name January (Itsuki means January). It's mainly used by Grandpa, but I will login and play occasionally too. That Break who was always online? Who will exterminate the enemy mercilessly to clear the stage?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that has to be a guy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The tone might sound girlish, but this was the classic example of a guy building a persona of a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, she is a girl! First year in Honami High School, your junior!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Grandpa didn't back down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's your basis for saying she is a girl?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ones engrossed in FPS were mostly guys, so I couldn't bear much hope in this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Based on my 73 years of life experience."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Well, girl or not aside, it might be possible that Break is my junior in school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's great, you have a friend of the opposite sex that love games." Both Grandpa and I refused to back down on Break's gender.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You must meet her in real life and invite her home. I will cheer for you! Well then, Grandpa need to get back to 【Hell Scream 4】... Don't talk to me from now on, you got that? Absolutely don't. This is a difficult stage, understand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tragedies could happen if one got distract in the midst of FPS. If someone talked to you during an important part, and you get distracted… All your hard work will be for nought. I then rolled around on the tatami mat minding my own business, while Grandpa became completely immersed into the TV screen. He focused on killing the enemy groups that appeared in concert with the music.</p>
<p class="null-p">I followed my Grandpa's lead, and started studying 【There are no heroines in my youth】.</p>
<p class="null-p">First of all-- the instruction manual. I focused on reading, and questioned Pandora periodically.</p>
<p class="null-p">I then confirmed that this game app was linked to reality, a system that predict encounters with the heroines.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under most circumstance, by going life normally, anyone will encounter a member of the opposite sex you would get to know deeply, known as the 'fated partner'. However, there were those with only shallow relationships, or wouldn't meet such a person. And I belonged to the latter. Fortunately, the chance of such people getting into relationship wasn't 0. It would range from 0.1% to 1%... probably. However, just this much probably was as good as nothing, and couldn't be changed by the person alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">And scraping up this paltry percentage, and turning into a visual</p>
<p class="null-p">game format, was what the app 【There are no heroines in my youth】 does.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was amazing! Japan's aging population problem could be solved by installing this onto every Japanese's phone right? I asked Pandora.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Everyone…? If we do that, the calculation will become very complicated. And… Itsuki's competitors will increase too.】</p>
<p class="null-p">She gave a bitter reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Assuming there is a girl 【Heroine X】. And the chance of Itsuki getting together with her was 1%.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't question or protest that. I just wish she could increase the percentage a little more.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Next, let's use the ace of Honami High School, Tsugawa Sakuya as an example opposite of Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Yes"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tsugawa huh. A name that appeared in the choice branch before. A handsome guy who excels in sports, but hates the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">【His chance of becoming a couple with 【Heroine X】 is 70%】</p>
<p class="null-p">"He actually has a 7 in 10 chance?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What the, this was a difference between heaven and hell! That was the gulf between us!</p>
<p class="null-p">【?Actually?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"What else would I say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【If it is Itsuki, I thought you will say 'only'.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"The topic is different from that time on the roof! Not just that, even the mentality is different from then!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Is that the reason? I have much to learn… So with 【Heroine X】 as the example, there might be a chance of people competing for the same target. Itsuki might be able to raise your chances from 1% to 60% through the predictions. But Tsugawa Sakuya can use the same means to increase his chances from 70% to 99%.】</p>
<p class="null-p">If that was so, wouldn't that be a lost cause?</p>
<p class="null-p">【And so, people with low probability of finding a lover would use this app most efficiently. They will bring out the most from this app.】</p>
<p class="null-p">That means it would get me onto the starting line, right? Although I wasn't at the starting line yet… And had even fallen into debt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to ask you about the loan."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Have you read the instruction manual yet?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did… But I still can't figure it out."</p>
<p class="null-p">The collateral for the loan. It was something taken from me. The instruction manual said 【Exchanging the future possibility of the customer into a currency known as Sols, which is reflected in the possible loan amount. The expenditure will be virtual during the loan period, and will only become actual when forced reparation is executed.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【I see… Explaining it in terms Itsuki can understand… Your 【luck】 will disappear, something like that?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"My real luck?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki don't have much fate with Heroines, but everyone else does. Isn't that great?】</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason, I didn't feel that was a compliment.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Friends, success in the eyes of society, great accomplishment…By reallocating your luck in these matters into your love life, you can increase your chance of meeting a heroine. Let me emphasize this again. Itsuki, you need to confirm one heroine in the next 5 days.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… When you say 'confirm', do you mean removing the 【?】 from the game? What kind of situation is that in real life?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【When the heroine acknowledge Tosa Itsuki as a human, and possess a certain level of good will towards you. It is only possible to fall in love from this stage on. If they detest you, or don't know you exist, or don't care you exist, then love will not be possible.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora told me the reasoning. That means that I was a detested, unknown or uncared-for existence to all the girls? Hahaha…! Should I laugh or cry?</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I understand the conditions. Speaking of which, the time limit to confirm the heroine… if I can't confirm one within five days, there will be a forced reparation of my loans right-- Specifically speaking, what will happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki haven't read about the explanation regarding forced reparation, right? Instead of listening to my explanation, it will be better for you to read this part again.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I shifted my gaze onto the phone. Normally, I should have read the instruction manual before taking the loan. I tapped on the link 【Regarding forced reparation.】.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Read the details】 and 【Trial experience (Free Sols will be given)】 options appeared before me.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Free Sols? So I will get them for free if I go through the trial experience?</p>
<p class="null-p">If there was such a special event, people wouldn't want to read the instruction manuals. I usually wouldn't read it either.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, let's start from the top with 【Read the details】. Tap… No reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tapped again.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I'm sorry, Itsuki. The connection with the main server seemed to be unstable.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a situation could happen in other apps too. Unable to reach the server even though I could access the internet-- What should I do in such a situation?</p>
<p class="null-p">Keep pressing! But the screen didn't change as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahahaha! I'm beat!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa's laughter reverberated in the living room. I turned to watch the tv as I continued pressing. The battle on the ground had shifted to the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">【It is a temporary outage, and will be up soon… ah."】</p>
<p class="null-p">……Ah?</p>
<p class="null-p">I glanced from the corner of my eyes. My finger had slid onto the 【Trial experience】 link. And the screen changed quickly this time… It will be fine, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">I already tapped 【Read the details】 plenty of times. Tapping there would definitely be--</p>
<p class="null-p">【Tosa Itsuki-san's forced reparation has been scheduled. For a better forced reparation experience, reading of the details and queries about it to your personal AI will be disabled. Experience time will be tomorrow 28th September Wednesday, 7:49am and the following one hour.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm, Pandora-chan"</p>
<p class="null-p">【…Yes.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I cancel the trial…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【No. Before you finish the trial, I can't answer your queries about forced reparation.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did it turn out like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【It is designed to act this way for players who chose 【Trial experience】 before referencing 【Read the details】. The rationale is that the experience for forced reparation will have a bigger impact this way.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"More impact? Is the forced reparation… enjoyable?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Who knows…】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora said with a troubled tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I don't think it is enjoyable, but it might be so for humans.】</p>
<p class="null-p">This gave the terrified me a little courage. Maybe it could be… enjoyable? At least it didn't seem to be something that brings suffering.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, with a hint of unease, I ended the question session with Pandora.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at the countdown screen on my phone. Getting up at 5am huh… If possible, I want to play now. I suddenly thought of a question, so I said to Pandora:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Pandora. Is the amount of time between playing session in this game random?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【This difference is dependent on the accuracy of the prediction. That's why there will be some differences between sessions.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… So it's not random?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Not at all.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm."</p>
<p class="null-p">That seemed to be so. Wait, it will be annoying if the gaming time is always set early in the morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- I will sleep earlier tonight then.</p>
<p class="null-p">2200hrs… No, 2100hrs… No no, 2000hrs. I could get up on time then.</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked towards the kitchen, and decided on my dish with whatever was inside the fridge. I then grab hold of the kitchen knife.</p>
<p class="null-p">After choosing my dish, I proceeded to prepare my breakfast!</p>
<p class="null-p">…The alarm rang. I reached out from under my covers, and knocked the top of my square alarm clock. It stopped. I pulled my hand back under the covers… At this moment, an electronic sound different from earlier disturbed my slumber. I reached out reluctantly, and groped around my pillow. I grabbed a phone-shaped item, brought it to my face and opened my eyes. I pressed the stop button on the screen. Phew, great, peace at last. I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">【-- Wake up. It's 28th September 4:55am. Itsuki, don't you want to continue the game?】</p>
<p class="null-p">A gentle and soothing voice sounded out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Another 10 minutes..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm. I nodded in my head, and set off for the dream world -However, 10 minutes later, an interruption occurred for the 3rd time.</p>
<p class="null-p">【10 minutes have passed. It is now 5:05. Itsuki ……Itsuki!】</p>
<p class="null-p">As if it was getting impatient, the phone started vibrating. To stop the vibration, I picked up the phone that slipped from my hand and brought it before my face. Stop-- There was no stop button?</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki! Get up now!】</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl's voice came from nearby, but I didn't have any female sibling or childhood friend that would wake me so gently… The girl's voice came from the phone-- The phone? My dull head finally started revving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Pandora-chan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. Good morning.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">So tired. I held back the urge to yawn. I got into bed at 2000hrs, even earlier than a grade schooler. I set the alarm clock I bought at the 100 yen shop to sound off slightly before 【There are no heroines in my youth】 could be played again. I also set the alarm on my phone as insurance. Lastly, I asked Pandora to wake me if I still couldn't get up. Pandora agreed without hesitation. To be honest, I thought I could get up by myself. Despite getting sufficient sleep, my body was…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora-chan, thank you…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora-chan was really capable!</p>
<p class="null-p">【It should be fine now.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The buzzing phone turned silent. I sat up and tap on my phone to launch the game. The countdown had already ended. Continue the game! Wednesday, the morning of the third day. I will preview today's schedule with the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was thinking about that, a system notification popped up.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Because of the split in the previous prediction, the system needed to be corrected. The prediction will be run again. Turning back time, sorry for any inconvenience.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Running the prediction again? Turning back time? What the hell? The game started with all these questions in my head-- And I understood what it means in no time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's saying that it will calculate the actions that I took..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday, I chose to visit the library in the game. This option was used in the original prediction. However, the time in the game had turned back to some time earlier, and I -- My avatar came to the rooftop. This make sense in the game, but I already went through what happened after school on Tuesday. However…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't the weather clear…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Jumping from rooftop to rooftop. My avatar did what I did, and jumped over. And because he wasn't affected by the adverse weather, he landed probably. He didn't make a fool of himself-- was this guy really me? The meeting with Rika-sama was slightly different. 【Tosa Itsuki heard the sound of sobbing】, and then I met the sobbing Rikasama. The Rika-sama I met had red eyes. So that was…?</p>
<p class="null-p">What was with the difference? Could this be, the effect of the error code that would definitely cause problems…? Well, if it was only to such an extent, it was still understandable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama's lines being dubbed was a pleasant surprise! I didn't know what technology was used, but it sounded just like Rika-sama's voice. It would be a let down if the 【Heroine ?】 wasn't dubbed. This should be the way!</p>
<p class="null-p">After 【Heroine A?Mochizuki Rika】 made her appearance, the story progressed similarly to reality. Invited by Rika-sama to the 【One Person Club】, then left after promising to have lunch together. My avatar then went home, took a bath, chat with Pandora, had dinner, got nagged at by Grandpa about various things then slept and woke up--</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, the game cut out a lot of the details, and will express them in simple terms. My conversation with Pandora was also simplified to 【Chatted with Pandora for a while】. This happened quite often, even my dialogue with Rika-sama was like that. There seemed to be some traces of cutting corners. Was this… because of the error code too? Or just the character of the person who created 【There are no heroines in my youth】? No matter what, what I was playing was like a recap, so that was fine. But from the morning of the third day onwards-- It would be preview, so I had to pay more attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tapped the screen with a serious face. It was finally time for the preview -- and heading into the unknown future.</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar left my house and went to school. As I woke up very early, my avatar reached school very early too. And then, after reaching school, the narration 【Tosa Itsuki experienced forced reparation】 was given. The specific content was omitted… Which made me concerned…</p>
<p class="null-p">No! The important thing was the heroine! My lunch break with Rikasama!</p>
<p class="null-p">Even I could figure that out by the third day.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lessons would be shown in narrative form-- but I was wrong?</p>
<p class="null-p">The first and second period passed by peacefully. During the third period, something beyond my expectation happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">On Wednesdays, the third period was English Expressions II. But the teacher was on urgent leave, so we had combined lessons with another class. Which class was it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Class 2-1! Speaking of class 2-1 -- That would be Nakajima-san, Nakajima Konoha's class! In 【There are no heroines in my youth】, she was the female student who served as the model for my heroine, right after Rika-sama!</p>
<p class="null-p">Following this development, she will make her appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">After meeting Rika-sama, I will finally meet another girl! Finally…! Finally, the premonition of the second heroine debuting was here!</p>
<p class="null-p">She had not appeared in the game yet, but it should be confirmed the moment I learned about having classes together with class 2-1! I continued the game in silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">The combined class was in the library. Including my avatar, the students from class 2 all headed over there. The class 1 students had reached there before us. The narrative text appeared. The content of the class was to pick a book and discuss it freely within your group, and write an essay to critique it. Could it be, since it's class 1… My chance to spend time with Nakajima-san would happen to my avatar?</p>
<p class="null-p">-- The choice branch appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Muster your courage and talk with Nakajima Konoha.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Choose a book and do the critique with your friends seriously.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Pick up the school scenery album from two years ago.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Puppurapi?】</p>
<p class="null-p">The first option then. There wasn't any other option, right? Choosing books with friends? That means Gon-chan and Kazuya? I could chat with them even when there wasn't any combined classes! The school scenery album from two years ago… It wasn't clear what meaning there was behind this. Even if there was, it would lose to the charm of the first option… Puppurapi? It was a</p>
<p class="null-p">【Pu】 last time, now it ends with a 【Pi】. Was the Puppura thing also because of the error code?</p>
<p class="null-p">So far, there had only been three options, but a fourth one appeared this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- In conclusion, I chose to speak with Nakajima-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">Go for it, my avatar!</p>
<p class="null-p">When the portrait of 【Heroine B? Nakajima Konoha】 appeared on my phone screen, I felt my thirst had been quenched.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her black long hair had a hair clip and plaits. She was shorter than Rika-sama's portrait, and had the qualities of the cutesy style and beautiful style.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san was heroine B…! I bit my lips on learning this fact.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, my avatar didn't make any move to approach her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stared at the unchanging screen on my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't thought that another choice branch would appear!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Compliment Nakajima Konoha's appearance.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Pick a fight with Nakajima Konoha.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Grope Nakajima Konoha's breast.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Third one then… I restrained myself from pressing the third option in a panic. It would be a blissful moment for a moment if I groped her. But after that would be hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">So the third option was NG… I decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I compliment her looks, or pick a fight. Considering the mundane options I chose on the first day, I should choose quarreling with her here. Well, in some stories, two people would start with a fight, and their relationship would start to warm up over time… But that wasn't possible here. This was reality! No, even though it was a game, it would turn into reality in a few hours.</p>
<p class="null-p">Taking interpersonal relationships into consideration, I should compliment her instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">But speaking of which, could my avatar find a normal topic to talk about with Nakajima-san?</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was me…! If it was me…! Oh no. I couldn't think of anything…! That was why--! That was why this option appeared here! If I was in front of Nakajima-san, I would become more nervous!</p>
<p class="null-p">…After choosing to compliment her.</p>
<p class="null-p">【-- Your large eyes are like unsculpted gems. Your long lustrous hair will sway gently in the wind even if you comb it with just your fingers. I have never seen a girl as pretty as you. And your kindness… You helped me before, and although it might just be something trivial to you, I still want to thank you.】</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar went craz-… acted uncharacteristically. Speaking words of praise fluently, he finished such a long line in one breath. I tapped several times before he complete his compliment.</p>
<p class="null-p">【That is a surprise.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san said. Because she was 【Heroine B?】, her lines were dubbed. Even though it was just one line, her voice had such destructive power! And she seemed to have taken it positively? Choosing to compliment her was the right choice… That's great.</p>
<p class="null-p">The conversation with Nakajima-san then begun. I have to remember it well… And so I tapped along slowly. As my avatar didn't have much lines, I should be able to pull it off in reality… Nakajimasan was unexpectedly eager to speak. My avatar didn't stutter with Nakajima-san leading the conversation! And so, my avatar finished the third period-- perfect. I properly introduced myself while talking to Nakajima-san too. Nakajima-san should acknowledge me as Tosa Itsuki now.</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded my head in agreement. This should be the ideal development of a love simulator!</p>
<p class="null-p">And the game could continue, it didn't turn into a countdown screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the fourth period, lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar headed to the rooftop… And Rika-sama was waiting for me there.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had to memorize the lunch scene with Rika-sama well, and prepped myself up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright, I pressed next eagerly!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing my revision of the game, I was now walking to school with a phone in one hand, mumbling to myself. As I didn't looking at my phone screen, I wasn't part of the crowd that had their head lowered down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your large eyes are like unsculpted gems. Eh… I want to comb your long lustrous hair… rustling in the wind."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Wrong, Itsuki. It's your long lustrous hair will sway gently in the wind even if you comb it with just your fingers.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I scratched my head in response to Pandora's accusation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next play session would be after my lunch with Rika-sama. It would be a while more until the next gaming time. From my experience with the preview, going with the choice I made in the game would be the correct way to go.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what troubled me was the long lines my avatar said to Nakajimasan in the library.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving its length aside, I was hesitant about the content. My avatar said it without any help, which meant this was the result of memorization…!</p>
<p class="null-p">I talked to myself as I proceeded.</p>
<p class="null-p">I… I will make sure my meeting with Nakajima-san--【Heroine B?】 and my lunch with Rika-sama yield results! There was only three days left…! I had to confirm the Heroine in five days!</p>
<p class="null-p">By the way, Rika-sama and Nakajima-san was actually my potential heroine… Was using girls out of my league as reference a great move, or overestimating myself….</p>
<p class="null-p">Near the school gate, as the lines were pretty embarrassing, I shut my mouth and stopped practising. There were too many students around.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a student council election event going on at the school gate. So it was this season again. Honami High School was holding its election right now to nominate its new president, vice president and other members. Since I always come to school right before I was late, I had never seen the morning election events before today. This was all thanks to my effort in getting up early.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, election… that means!</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san was running for the seat of the student council president! Maybe I could get to see her? As I was thinking about that, I looked around and only saw the male student running against Nakajima-san, but she herself wasn't here.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki, it's 7:49. The forced reparation experience is about to begin.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Roger."</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking of which, if something happens on my way to school… Wait, nothing happened? I looked around me to confirm. Nakajimasan's opponent was making an announcement via microphone. His student helpers were giving out pamphlets. Among the students filing into school-- was Rika-sama.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were several students following her as if they were her minions. From what Rika-sama said yesterday, this group was probably following her of their own accord. Rika-sama adheres to the three principles faithfully, and wouldn't approach that group on her own, and she walked towards her classroom with a displeased and cold expression. But behind that expression, she was almost at her limits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, Rika-sama's icy gaze turned my way.</p>
<p class="null-p">That surprised me, but her eyes didn't fall on me as expected. The one who was acquainted with Rika-sama was Regist-san, not Tosa Itsuki. She didn't particularly liked me, so anyone wearing a Recycling Bag could replace me. What a depressing fact.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was afraid of strangers. If not for what happened yesterday, I wouldn't have imagined… However, why was she like that? Why did Rika-sama feared strangers so much? She was rich, had a beautiful appearance, and I think her academics wasn't too bad either. She was popular with the opposite sex too. If not for her fear of strangers, she could enjoy her youth properly. It wouldn't be strange if there wasn't any particular reasons for this. Such cases do exist. But more likely than not, there would be a reason behind this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama left and I became motivated, walking forward energetically.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning, virgin"</p>
<p class="null-p">Really now, why was there a guy starting the morning with such crude words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, virgin!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't feel any malicious intention, but the guy being bullied was really sad. If they went overboard, the other party couldn't answer back amiably. This voice sounded familiar, but it must just be my imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">The footsteps approached my back. And then, he came to my side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the matter, virgin, why are you ignoring me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was my friend Yamai Gonzaburou, Gon-chan. Because Gonchan lived quite far from school, he would leave plenty of time everyday for his morning commute to avoid being late. Therefore, it was rare for me to meet him on the way to school. And this morning was one of those rare times.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Gon-chan…So Gon-chan is someone who will take revenge in such a way! I was wrong about you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Revenge? What? Virgin, why are you mad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His harmless expression and his contradictory words multiplied the effect!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yamai! I promise to call you Yamai from now on! I promise! So please show mercy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">So please don't call me virgin in public anymore! Where did your empathy as a samurai go!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… It's fine to call me by my given name. Akari wants to call me Gon-chan. From Gonzaburou, the nickname Gon-chan doesn't sound bad on second thought. Isn't that right, virgin?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You mad! You're definitely mad!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not mad, virgin"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that I'm a virgin! But shouldn't this be kept under wraps? Then I could pretend that I actually have experience, right? Wasn't everyone like that too!? I wasn't aware of it, but did I do anything that incurred the wrath of Gon-chan? Maybe because I addressed him as Gon-chan and…? He said it was fine, but he was actually bearing a grudge?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the… I'm just calling you by your name, do you have to be so mad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, like I said, my name is……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it Dou and Tei, Doutei[1]?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doutei…? That's, me…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Why are you acting so weird?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gon-chan nodded calmly, and looked very natural.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo Yamai, Virgin!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning training group in tracksuits was running from the staircase to the school gate. The guys from class two waved at us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning, Doutei!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leaving Gon-chan aside, it's rare seeing Doutei come to school at this timing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Another two person greeted us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">I pushed myself to wave back, and the tracksuit group ran off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aside from Gon-chan, three people had called me by that name! Called me Doutei! What kind of joke was this…!</p>
<p class="null-p">My name… Is there anything with my name on it…? The student handbook! I hurriedly took out the student handbook I treated as a miscellaneous item from my breast pocket. My photo was on it. The name was…?</p>
<p class="null-p">The name written in bold letters was 【Doutei Doutei】[2]. I felt a little faint and staggered a little. How was this possible… You have got to be kidding me. Virgin Virgin. Virgin two hit combo. And despite the name being a virgin, it used a cool kanji that means emperor! God is dead!</p>
<p class="null-p">This continued after I reached the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning, Doutei-kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">Virgin-kun. The polite greeting from my female classmate scored a critical hit to my heart…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doutei-kun. Doutei-kun, can you fill this in? This is a survey for the whole class…"</p>
<p class="null-p">And this was the only time when the female students would talk to me!</p>
<p class="null-p">The one hour after forced reparation began was spent in humiliation. I was call 【Doutei】【Doutei】and 【Doutei】 countless times… My given name and family name were both virgin! There was no escape!</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the first time I hoped so sincerely that Homeroom and the first period will come earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">After setting up my phone, I hid it between my text book. I couldn't wait for lunch break anymore, and waited for the seconds to tick away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Exactly one hour has passed. It was still in the middle of first period, and I took my phone that was in vibration mode from the side of the desk, using the textbook as a shield. As expected, a notification popped up.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Forced reparation experience is now finished. During forced reparation, according to the loan amount, you would need to live as 【Doutei Doutei】 for a set amount of time. We seek your kind understanding.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Kind understanding your head ahhhhh!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Furthermore, your name will affect your body. During your time as 【Doutei Doutei】, you may not have sexual intercourse. All sorts of situation will be prohibited and impossible to come true.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Can I cry now?</p>
<p class="null-p">【Thank you for your hard work. As a reward for your experience,</p>
<p class="null-p">2000 Sols have been sent to your account.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Which means, if the forced reparation happened to me, I would have</p>
<p class="null-p">to spend a certain amount of time-- depending on my loan… About a year? It might be longer than a year-- I would be addressed by the people around me as Doutei Doutei and live out such a shame-play. On top of that, I would be a real virgin all that time too, and wouldn't climb the stairs of becoming an adult. I didn't think it was a bluff or a threat. I didn't know the reason, but it would become reality, that was how the game 【There are no heroines in my youth】 was!</p>
<p class="null-p">Three years of high school… giving up like this would be fine-- As if! Spare me the misery of graduating with my right hand as my lover!</p>
<p class="null-p">If I couldn't confirm a heroine in five days, it would be better if I didn't start the game in the first place… Or would this persist until I was 30 or 40 years old…?</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that you could use magic if you stayed a virgin until 40? Haha. What kind of magic would that be. I did heard such an urban legend before…</p>
<p class="null-p">-- I only played in the hope that a heroine would appear in my youth. This shallow emotion landed me in the claws of forced reparation!</p>
<p class="null-p">With this conviction in mind, I focused on the third period.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like how the game was, the third period was a combined class with class 1 inside the library. I decided to execute the option 【Muster your courage and talk with Nakajima Konoha】!</p>
<p class="null-p">I had to talk to Nakajima-san quickly, I imagined myself turning into a wolf and started moving.</p>
<p class="null-p">First was following her inside the library!</p>
<p class="null-p">Like the game, today's lesson was to choose and borrow a book, and write a book report to be submitted later. There were students who had already started discussing. Conversations could be heard everywhere inside the library that was usually quiet. And of course, there were students who had fallen into a dilemma.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san… Where is Nakajima-san...</p>
<p class="null-p">Honami High School's library was huge, and there were many shelves too. There were also plenty of blind spots. And couples would act intimately inside these blind spots away from the gaze of the people around them. I already seen quite a few couples during this lesson.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- I found Nakajima-san. I wanted to approach her and started moving. Nakajima-san was moving around a lot. She was talking to her female friends, and walked away-- She's alone now! That's my chance!</p>
<p class="null-p">I closed the gap between Nakajima-san and me. She was about a meter away from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was so small, and looked just right for me to hug… Her hair looked so nice, even though it was long, it wasn't too gaudy and the hair clip was simple too. Her plaits were perfect as well, and her face was even more perfect.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Her portrait was nice, but the real person was still the best.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected of the pure style beauty that was the pride of our school.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Now that I think about it, this was the second time I met Nakajima-san in real life.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the first school term of the second year was about to end, a girl from my class, the handsome guy from the soccer club and me were summoned to the teacher's office. My home room teacher asked us to do some work. The reason he picked us was because the three of us just happened to be around. Tsugawa was fine, but the girl! The girl was a big obstacle! She had the hots for Tsugawa! And then I started stuttering at the girl. The more anxious I was, the more my words stick together. The irritated girl started lashing out at me as I apologized in my heart. She wanted to do the job alone with Tsugawa, and I was caught in between. At this moment!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Did something happen?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san appeared. Aside from her beautiful face, there seemed to be a light shining from behind her. She smiled gently at me, and after waiting patiently for me to finish my stuttery sentence, she helped me explained everything clearly. And the three of us completed the task. Not four of us, but three. The female student from my class withdrew, and Nakajima-san stood in for her. And the teacher's request was finished smoothly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She left the deep impression of being a good person back then. Please be elected as the president.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now, there were posters of student election candidates all over campus. Nakajima-san was the overwhelming favourite in being chosen as the president. No matter what, only the posters of Nakajima-san had reports of being stolen.</p>
<p class="null-p">The school had to attend a rally between the fifth and sixth period on this Friday, 30th September. The candidates would give their speeches, and their nominee would also give speeches to state their support. The rest of the time would be the casting of votes after returning to our respective classrooms. The results would be announced next week, and the new student council would be inaugurated. My vote has already been decided to be cast for Nakajima-san. I haven't forgotten the help she rendered me!</p>
<p class="null-p">And now, she was right before me, 【Heroine B?】--Nakajima Konoha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-N-N-Nakajima-san!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I resolve myself to talk to her. Nakajima-san looked at me in surprise, and a moment later.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Your large eyes are like unsculpted gems. Your long lustrous hair will sway gently in the wind even if you comb it with just your fingers. I have never seen a girl as pretty as you. And your kindness… You helped me before, and although it might just be something trivial to you, I still want to thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright, I said it!</p>
<p class="null-p">I memorized the lines my avatar said! I spent the earlier period on this too, and could finally say it in one go. What a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stay cool. With natural motions, I glanced at the screen of the phone I was holding in my right hand. Pandora's voice couldn't be silenced even if I turn my phone to vibrate mode. I couldn't control it through the game settings either. Right now, she didn't use any sound, and only answered with texts. How did I do without using a script!?</p>
<p class="null-p">【Congratulations, Itsuki. Error rate is 0, you did it.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Right? Right?</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded several times in my heart in response to Pandora's message that was displayed on my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a triumph![3]</p>
<p class="null-p">However-- I felt a little uneasy. Why wasn't Nakajima-san reacting?</p>
<p class="null-p">Did I recite my lines wrongly? Impossible, Pandora said I passed… I started tensing up. I stole a peek at Nakajima-san. I will be more nervous if I looked at her directly.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took reference from the three principles of the Mochizuki onii-sama and shifted my gaze skywards-- As I couldn't see the sky, I stared at the ceiling to calm myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That surprised me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She finally recovered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a surprise… but still, thank you. I'm happy to be complimented like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">From Nakajima-san's perspective, a male student she just met complimented her looks with extremely flattering prose. But she didn't seem to mind that and accepted with her open heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are from class 2…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-T-Tosa! Tosa Itsuki!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And my performance here would be the moment Nakajima-san acknowledges me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fufu, Nakajima-san smiled a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will be in your care, Tosa-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-O-O-Okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as planned. I am the one who is in your care!</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of class is class 2?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The w-w-well known person here is Tsugawa Sakuya!"</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar answered like this in the game. Leaving that aside, I didn't planned to say that, but I said that unconsciously… By the way, why did I have to say a guy's name here? Well, it was the fact anyway. The famous people in class 2 would be the soccer ace Tsugawa and the president of the archery club Takeda, the two handsome guys… Although they both have girlfriends in other schools, a lot of people in Honami High School surprisingly didn't know that,.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">On Nakajima-san's invitation, we selected our own books and sat down in a two seater desk at a corner of the library. I stuttered a lot and didn't say anything interesting. But even so, her gentle smile didn't disappear. Thanks to that, by the time the bell rang, I didn't stutter anymore when I spoke to Nakajima-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I enjoyed myself, thanks to Tosa-kun, I had a meaningful and enjoyable time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san carried her bag before her chest with both hands and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I scratched my head shyly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"See you next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">She waved at me. Nakajima-san did that to me that was completely out of her league. She was definitely waving at Tosa Itsuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Goodbye…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her words lingered in my ears, how wonderful. So there will be a next time, huh? I waved my hand briskly, and saw off Nakajima-san's back as she left.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a sense of accomplishment, I welcomed the fourth period with a brilliant smile. Even though Gon-chan was staring at me, I didn't mind at all. Kazuya asked: "Itsuki found a girlfriend too?". I told him the truth probably. I didn't!</p>
<p class="null-p">There was still ways to go before confirming anyone's status as a heroine. However, the chance to approach a heroine --approach Rikasama would be here at lunch break!</p>
<p class="null-p">The time I fixed with Rika-sama was here. I took the beverage I brought from home with me to the snack shop, and purchased the egg mayo sandwich set and sweet paste bun. I took an extra white Recycling Bag. And headed straight for the rooftop! At the entrance leading to the rooftop, I took out the Recycling Bag. After hastily poking three holes for my eyes and mouth, I put it on, tied it around my neck and voila.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt someone's presence and turned back. No one was there… Was it just my imagination?</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked up the stairwell and headed to roof access.</p>
<p class="null-p">I will jump from the roof this time too -- there was no way I would do that okay? I went to the roof of the eastern building where the shed of the 【One Person Club】 was situated. I tried my luck and turned the knob, and it was locked as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I announced my name, and knocked on the silver door. The door opened with the sound of the lock being opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are here, Regist-san! Sorry for making you wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama appeared with a brilliant smile. She looked completely different from the glimpse I caught of her at the school gate this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for having me..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was ushered into the rooftop. Rika-sama then secured the silver door with the thumb turn lock. Uninvited guest won't be able to gain entry. Rika-sama was really thorough. If she didn't do so, people might start to gather here.</p>
<p class="null-p">I visited the 【One Person Club】 together with Rika-sama.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike yesterday, two chairs were prepared right from the beginning.</p>
<p class="null-p">A lunch box covered in a green checkered cloth was on the table. Because of my impression of her being a lady from a rich family, my expectation of the lunch box being a big black square box fell short.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was already time for lunch. I sat down and thought back on my game review session.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lunch was explained with just one line. It was 【Tosa Itsuki and company had an enjoyable lunch】! This should be important! Give me more details!</p>
<p class="null-p">But it wasn't listed!</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, I had to work hard in turning this into an enjoyable lunch!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bon appetit."</p>
<p class="null-p">After putting her hands together, Rika-sama undid the cloth around her lunch box, unveiling a small two layered lunch box that appeared plain like ours commoners.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bon appetit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I laid out my egg mayo sandwich set as I looked at Rika-sama's lunch box. She opened the lid with her hands that was so white that I want to caress them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah."</p>
<p class="null-p">The lunchbox was like a commoners, but the inside was completely different! No, the content could actually be considered to be normal. The first layer had three mini rice balls with different fillings. The second layer had an omelette roll, cherry tomatoes, octopus wiener, salad spring roll, meatballs and handmade pudding as dessert.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though these were the dishes, there were no signs of them being frozen food. Each dish was made to perfection, even the omelette roll alone was on the level of restaurant food. Be it the arrangement, combination and appearance, everything was perfect. This wasn't a level a housewife could achieve… But the standard of a professional!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama seemed surprised, probably because I made a weird sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is Senpai's lunch box… made by a professional chef?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama smiled happily. "No, it's made by onii-sama!"</p>
<p class="null-p">O-Onii-sama?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onii-sama's hobby is making food, and he still brings a lunch box to school after enrolling in university. He said that making lunch for one or two person isn't too different, so he made one for me too. This is really delicious. Ah, the omelette roll is made by me though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mochizuki-senpai is great at cooking too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, not really."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama turned fidgety. Her eyebrows drooped a little, and she looked so cute. The gap Moe of Rika-sama was really wonderful!</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the past I went to help onii-sama with his cooking without thinking too much. Onii-sama then nabbeded me and trained me until he became satisfied with my standard before letting me go. I spent those days undergoing special training while getting yelled at, so I can cook even though I don't want too..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Ahh, special training while getting yelled at."</p>
<p class="null-p">I understand completely, it must just be like the time with the three principles.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, it was terrible.Onii-sama treats girls seriously, so he will make dessert himself as a gift on white day. He made desserts while teaching me, that time was really..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama repeated their conversations from back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Rika, what did I ask you to make?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【… Cream Puff.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Oh, so you remember what you are supposed to be making. Then</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika, what do you think this looks like?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Like a mayonnaise covered shiitake mushroom that had been grilled.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【What a coincidence, I think so too… Do it again! Why did the cream puff become like this!? Did you follow my instructions when you made it? Are the measurement for the ingredients fine? The temperature of the oven? And the timing?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【… Well, who knows?-- Eh? Onii-sama! Please don't grab my head!】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Hey. You! The ingredients measurement are just estimates, right? For snacks, the key is accurate measurements! The. Key!】</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were like that back then, but he still managed to teach Mochizuki-senpai how to make omelette roll…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Onii-sama sure was strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The importance of the measuring spoon and cup has been engraved deep within my heart, although I'm still far behind onii-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all, Mochizuki-senpai is amazing too. That omelette roll looks really nice. I only have guys in my home, and we aren't that good with dishes like senpai and your onii-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa and I were both men, so our culinary level was average. Volume! Filling! That was the most important. The ingredients and seasoning were usually added in by rough gauge in large quantities. Whether it looked appetizing didn't matter! That was how it was. I've made omelette roll before, but there would be scorch marks. Even so, I could make something edible if I do proper taste testing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Erm, if you don't mind, please have some?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama picked up an omelette roll and brought it to my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">E-Ehh? My face hidden behind the Recycling Bag flushed as I became flustered. Could this be, the thing intimate couples do…? Or rather, even couples seldom do this, the alluring…? Was this really fine? Or was I too self-conscious? Or she just wanted to place it on the packaging of the bread!? No, if I don't give this a try…!</p>
I <p class="null-p">opened my mouth. The Recycling Bag was in the way… Eventhough I finally encountered such a scene…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama leaned towards me, and placed the omelette roll inside my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes~ the right answer ahhhh! This was something all men dream of trying at least once…! My wish came true…!</p>
<p class="null-p">Lost in deep emotions, I realized Rika-sama seemed to be uneasy.</p>
<p class="null-p">I-I wonder if it suits your taste… that sort of expression! Oh no!</p>
<p class="null-p">I moved my mouth and savoured the taste. The omelette roll[4] Rika-sama made was the stock variant, it was a little sweet, a delicate taste guys like me and grandpa couldn't achieve.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, I was so~ moved, and the taste was moving too. Was it fine for me to be so blissed?</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Senpai, this is delicious!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is just a simple dish."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama's turned red, and it was very obvious because of her pale skin. She then smiled gently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so glad that onii-sama taught me how to cook."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt really bashful. I then chewed on my sandwich, and Rika-sama said she was interested in them. I offered her a piece I haven't eaten yet. Rika-sama have probably never eaten the bread from the snack shop. But it wasn't because she disdain such peasantry things. It seemed that the reason was, if Rika-sama went to buy bread, the chaos would trouble the snack shop. Which was the well known problems of celebrities. She wanted to try even more variety of bread. And the truth was, all the bread sold by the snack shop were delicious. I guarantee that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama seemed to find the taste satisfactory.</p>
<p class="null-p">After lunch, Rika-sama brewed some tea. Yesterday's tea was actually Darjeeling, and today's tea was Assam.</p>
<p class="null-p">And next-- the real thing begins now. I call forth the content of this morning's preview into my mind. In the game, my avatar and Rikasama spent an enjoyable lunch together, and Rika-sama provided some tea. I would need to take action next.</p>
<p class="null-p">I also realized that this was the time to act!</p>
<p class="null-p">"What time is it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I pretended to check the time, and took out my phone from my uniform's pocket-- I acted as if I took something else out unintentionally, and placed it on the table. Although my avatar did this without looking awkward, it felt like an act, when I did so myself. "!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama quivered a little, then stared at what I took out incidentally-- the tail plushy I picked up at the courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san, this is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, it's not mine… I picked it up somewhere. I planned to hand it over to the teacher's office later, so I kept it on me..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama grabbed my hand as I was about to keep it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is mine! Thank you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was dangerous! I almost blurted out that I would give it to her. Actually, I do want to return it to her. However, I still needed to mimic my avatar's action. That guy was too suspicious of things! But he didn't return the item at this juncture, so I have to do the same…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Ah… but I'm not sure if this belongs to senpai... Is this really yours?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That being said, my avatar was probably right. There wasn't any names on the tail plushy, and considering the possibility that someone might lie to get this item, I should confirm this even if it was Rikasama. But with its scent as evidence, did I really think that Rika-sama was lying?</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar! You didn't understand at all! At that moment when I was holding the phone, I lowered my head painfully at how cold my avatar was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That is my amulet since kindergarten! That's why it looked really dated, that stain came from ink, and it is still there no matter how many times I wash it. There are signs of it being mended here too. The strap was a birthday gift from onii-sama when I was nine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if she wanted to hold onto the plushy with both hands, everything she said matches the script in the game flawlessly. This definitely belonged to Rika-sama. I already confirmed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for suspecting you… I will return this to the owner then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama held the tail plushy tightly as she peeked my way, and sighed in relief -- Alright, that's enough. The situation developed just like the game. I then prepared to leave the 【One Person Club】. I was glad that the tail plushy was returned.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I got caught off guard here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… It's unsightly, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama said softly… Huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unsightly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- A toy when I was young-- A tail plushy. It's weird for me to cherish this so much now that I'm in high school, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all! Liking and cherishing something isn't anything to be ashamed of no matter how old you get!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa was over 70 years old, but he still love to play video games. He likes manga too, shonen manga from an era I didn't know of, and the trending best sellers right now, he reads all of them. He was still far from retiring from the scene. Even now, he was waiting for his favourite manga on hiatus to restart again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had a rag that was cut up terribly by scissors. My mom washed it when I was in middle school, and I had a huge fight with her over it..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because that rag was my personal possession. Even my mother wasn't allowed to invade into that space. If it wasn't washed carefully by hand, its lifespan would be reduced. And as expected, she wanted to throw it away. A horrible fight broke out between my mother and me who was stubbornly protecting it. I managed to kept it in the end, and brought it along when I moved to my Grandpa's place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The smell and the feel of it are important…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I shut my mouth after saying something weird. This conversation shouldn't have happened… No, maybe it was omitted and stated in a simple narration? Rika-sama said quietly:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I should be apologizing for saying such nonsensical things..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's fine. I'm glad you picked it up too… I didn't remember when I lost it, and have given up after failing to find it. Since I lost it in school, I searched all the places I had been to before-- Although I found it in the courtyard in the end..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Courtyard…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe Rika-sama was talking about her first meeting with me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someone I didn't know was holding it. I didn't expect that, if I could only asked him directly, but I couldn't do it. The other party talked to me, so I followed onii-sama's three principles and ran away… I don't know who that person was either. That's why, I felt I wouldn't ever get it back..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Could it be… Rika-sama looked at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san, are you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. I didn't meet senpai at the courtyard before, and I picked this up somewhere else…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">I planned to answer normally, but my tone might seem unnatural even though a Recycling Bag was covering my face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama asked with a baffled expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no, it's nothing -- I need to return to class soon, senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">I pushed the 【One Person Club】 to the back of my mind. In order to open the door leading to the stairwell, I reached for the thumb lock and thought:</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm the male student she met.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did I refute Rika-sama just now?</p>
<p class="null-p">If she knew I'm Tosa Itsuki, wouldn't we progress our relationship even further?</p>
<p class="null-p">No, I knew why. Because I didn't want her to know that I was the male student who stuttered "A-Ahhhhhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama had a good impression of Regist-san. Regist-san speaks with Rika-sama as a normal junior. I didn't want her to know he was actually the plain and normal me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope this won't affect anything…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning preview only lasted until I return the tail plushy to Rika-sama and leaving the 【One Person Club】. The phone screen then turned black and a countdown was displayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">What would happen in the afternoon was still blank. What should I do if I ran into those two people again? I would be glad to meet them, but if I messed up and get hated… I feel uneasy without the guidance of the preview.</p>
<p class="null-p">I took out my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was still one minute left on the countdown. I could continue in a short while… But no matter how anxious I was, I still needed to return to the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned the thumblock and opened the door with a sigh. I then turned stiff from surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">After opening the door-- Nakajima Konoha was standing right there. Leaning onto the wall within the stairwell, she looked this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hello."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… H-Hello."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your voice is average…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to my greeting, Nakajima-san showed a confused expression. She then followed it up with a question:</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- I have a request."</p>
<p class="null-p">I backed away to the door and nodded. Because of a strange sense of intimidation. How strange, even though Nakajima-san was smiling? Why did I feel like a herbivore being targeted by a carnivore?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you take off that Recycling Bag?"</p>
<p class="null-p">How could I take it off? I attended class with Nakajima-san in the library today, and she would recognize me if I took it off, right? Unlike Rika-sama, I couldn't let her know about this. As Rika-sama had an irrational fear of strangers, she could accept Regist-san who wears a Recycling Bag as a hobby… But others would just think of me as a pervert. So I should leave the scene as an anonymous Recycling Bag guy…….</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you take it off?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She increased her pressure. I gave up and undid the knot at my neck and took off the Recycling Bag. I lowered my head in greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hello."</p>
<p class="null-p">I immediately heard a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">-- That's it? Nakajima said that? With such a disappointing tone?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought I uncovered a new handsome guy… Don't do such misleading things."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… Ehh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san observed me from various angles… she then sighed and crossed her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter what angle I looked at you from, you are not handsome at all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was being pitied, I got pitied so hard. But since just now, Nakajimasan's words and tone sounded strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I might not be handsome… but how did you mixed me up with one?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san likes handsome guys? No, that should be normal for everyone, guys like pretty girls, girls like handsome guys. But</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't Mochizuki Rika someone who only goes after hot guys?."</p>
<p class="null-p">Going after hot guys… What an impactful phrase, haha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"According to my intelligence network, Mochizuki Rika will shake off her followers and have lunch at the rooftop, which is well known. She have never invited anyone in before. However! I saw a male student went in just now! And he visited Mochizuki Rika's place with a Recycling bag over his head! It was a romantic rendezvous between Mochizuki Rika and that male student. And with a guy covering his face. That must be a guy handsome enough to be on Mochizuki Rika's level! That's what I thought, but..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The teary eyed Nakajima … san stood unsteadily, and as a gentleman, I decided to catch her before she falls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your eyes are sharp, huh? But if it's you, you are just one step away from being a pervert."</p>
<p class="null-p">She sighed unhappily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah--, I'm deeply hurt…"</p>
<p class="null-p">My wounds were deep too!</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so, who are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Nakajima-san… No, there was no need for the san anymore! Nakajima asked me such a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa !Tosa Itsuki! Today! Combined lesson! Library!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima rest her chin on her hand, and looked at me with her head tilted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You even said 【Please take care of me from now on】 and 【see you next time】……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said that? Hah! That's just being diplomatic. This is how I deal with everyone else aside from hot guys. Those who aren't hot guys are really numerous, so I don't want to make enemies carelessly. However -- it is a huge mistake to assume that I will remember and differentiate the hordes of non-hot guys I meet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">So that was the reason why she was gentle and treated everyone equally… It just happened a few hours ago, and she had completely forgotten about it. The time and effort I spent to memorize my lines was…!</p>
<p class="null-p">S-So what!? I still remember the surprised look she showed when I recited my lines. Nakajima showed such an expression and her mood turned great and clapped too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah! The overconfident generic face whose only commendable point is that you complimented me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Generic, face…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't help it either. If someone's face value falls beyond a certain point, they all look the same to me. But generic face, I can tell from your compliments that you have a good eye for things. You also told me about Tsugawa-kun, I'm really grateful for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh, so that's how it was. Because of her personality, she readily accepted such over the top flattery…</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that she mentioned it… What I talked about in the library was mainly about my classmate Tsugawa Sakuya. Because Nakajima wanted to hear more. The choice branch… about inviting Tsugawa Sakuya to the library appeared before. So that choice would lead to my meeting with Nakajima?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you like Tsugawa?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If she already has someone she liked, it would be impossible to remove the 【?】 from 【Heroine B?】right? The difficulty was on the level of 【Heroine B???】! However, Nakajima gave an unexpected answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm. I do like him, but that didn't seem right either? Because I like Takeda-kun too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san was all smiles as the corner of her lips rose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright then, generic face, I will do you a service and tell you. I like hot guys!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I got that subtly… No, I learned about that quite obviously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My goal is to form a reverse harem with hot guys! I want a boyfriend for Monday, one for Tuesday, another one for Wednesday, another one for Thursday, another one for Friday and another one for Saturday. On</p>
<p class="null-p">Sunday, I will decide who to spend time with depending on my mood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Six people at the same time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She wasn't fazed by my dumbfounded comment at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't men dream about building a harem too? Being liked by cute girls and dating all of them. Isn't this the same thing? There are cases where they like two person at the same time, right? Be it men or women, you would get sick of it if you only date one person. Having a rotating roster would definitely allow for a longer lasting relationship!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That might be so… But for the member of the rotating cast… wouldn't it be like a fraud…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't look down on me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima widen her eyes with rage instantly. Her hands on her hips seemed to emphasized that her pride had been insulted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're wrong, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will get the other party's consensus."</p>
<p class="null-p">She started preaching.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pretending to be dating one guy and toying with several men at the same time is just being unfaithful! It's just being fickle! I won't do something like that! I will tell each of the hot guys probably that I have another boyfriend and ask him to be my Monday boyfriend for example. I will get his permission. It can only be a reverse harem after all of us comes to an agreement right-- I think this is reasonable, but there will definitely be outsiders who will complain. The girls will be jealous because I am hogging all the hot guys! The boys will bear a grudge because I ranked them so far back!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What you said make sense…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's great that you get it, generic face. Going by the same reasoning, a harem is possible too. If the girls are okay with that, I won't mind a guy in my reverse harem having a harem of his own… Or rather, wouldn't things be smoother that way…? But that harem guy has to be a hottie too..."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's a great idea! Nakajima who brightened up with her hands together before her chest turned sullen a few seconds later and shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you're forming a reverse harem, you will not compromise on dating anyone but hotties?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was an important question for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible."</p>
<p class="null-p">She answered with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima placed her hands on her face that was blushing. Just going by appearance, she was a pure and beautiful young girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I dig handsome faces. And those who look like hotties must be hotties on the inside too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eehhh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, you got a problem with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The pure beautiful young girl morphed instantly into a carnivorous beauty hiding malicious intent behind her smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are people who looked ugly, but is a hottie in his heart too…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"- Huh. Where?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Where… I had no idea even if she ask me where…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't raise an objection if you can't even give one example.</p>
<p class="null-p">According to my experience, all hotties are hotties on the inside too. On the other hand, the ugly ones are twisted on the inside too! Not just boys, it's the same for girls too. Those ugly girls are jealous of a miraculous beauty like me, and their mouth will turn even uglier! And when I reject the boy's confession, they will try to overwhelm me with brute force…! Ahh, it's maddening even when I think about it!" "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I stuck closely to the door to the roof.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima launched a spinning kick to the wall of the stairwell, and her skirt twirled about, exposing her panties-- The instant I was thinking about that, her kick landed perfectly. So strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew."</p>
<p class="null-p">She tidied her hair and turned to me quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Let's assume someone ugly but is a hottie on the inside exist. You might be right, but it's too hard to find one. But, what if someone who is a hottie both inside and outside is around? It will be easy to find one. Is there any reason to choose someone ugly? Why don't you think about it in my shoes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There isn't any reason to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right, why would I pick the ugly one, Sato?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima nodded to affirm this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… It's Tosa."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa huh. I will forget soon anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she tilted her head cutely, it won't go back to the way it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">The image of that gentle and pure beauty Nakajima Konoha was crumbling loudly in my mind. Nakajima was a carnivorous combative type who planned to build a reverse harem, that was the truth.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"T-Then your kindness towards me when I was with Tsugawa and the others in the teacher's office?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I did something like that? I treated the generic face Katou kindly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't remember as expected, damn it! I knew it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, the one who was together with generic face was the ace of the soccer club Tsugawa-kun right? Then that is a reason! To show myself off in front of a hottie, Yamada! Isn't that obvious?" Katou and Yamada were referring to me?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please work hard on building your reverse harem..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was too arrogant. Actually, I thought for a tiny bit that Nakajimasan who treated me gently was… Not this Nakajima. I thought I could confirm Nakajima-san as a heroine without too much effort. I was too naive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since it's Nakajima … san, you have already found two or three members… of your reverse harem, right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…… Not yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">Was this a taboo question? Nakajima-san lowered her head meekly. What happened?</p>
<p class="null-p">"That can't be, isn't there plenty of handsome boys in Honami High</p>
<p class="null-p">School? Tsugawa Sakuya from my class for example."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not satisfied with just handsome guys. To realize my dreams, they need to be perfect and handsome!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"… What, you don't want to hear more?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't ask because I don't want to know, but she didn't plan to let me off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is your ideal?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima told me about it cheerfully. Above 180cm in height, excellent grades and perfect in sports. Having academic abilities to enroll in the same university as her--Nakajima had the brains to reach the top 10 in exams, and got great results in all categories during the sports meet. She was good at fighting too. She hated fake hotties who style their hair and wear clothes to pretend to be a hottie. Hotties who were limited to posting their photoshopped profile pic to SNS were out too. Hotties who could still shine when they wear nerdy cloths were the real hottie. Great personality, dependable on crucial moments, and he needed to have a cute side too.</p>
<p class="null-p">What the hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said a lot more too… With how much she was demanding, there shouldn't be many guys who could match her requirement. Or rather, wasn't this the male character in a shoujo manga? Could it be, Nakajima… was the type who couldn't get a boyfriend because her expectations was too high? But her outward appearance of a pure young beauty was great.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nakajima … san, have you had a boyfriend before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After describing her ideal prince, Nakajima sighed lacklusterly:</p>
<p class="null-p">"You get it right? Generic face.… I can't find a hottie that satisfy my requirements yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then changed her depressed mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So recently, I think I have to compromise. I'm in my second year already, this can't go on. I took action for this before, but I only put in a small amount of effort. At this moment, I saw an illusion-- just a few minutes ago, I was hoping that Mochizuki Rika was meeting with a super hottie, and thought about NTRing[5] her..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"NTR is a bit too much, right…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it a person's freedom to confess to a guy who already have a girlfriend? If he isn't willing, the guy can just turn me down. Then I will give up right there. I won't do more than that to obstruct a couple's love. But if the party chose me, doesn't that mean that guy likes me more than his girlfriend? That means it is my win in terms of love!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She took a deep breath at this juncture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--But a generic face is just a generic face, so I won't take you away from Mochizuki Rika's side, don't worry. Anyway, with my hope of meeting a super hottie I have never seen before shattered, I finally understand I have to compromise to some extent."</p>
<p class="null-p">I, I was of help? Hahaha!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually… Mochizuki Rika's hottie ex-boyfriend who knew her for the longest time will transfer in the second term… to this school tomorrow. I have high hopes of his growth… He was a hottie in his first year, but he was still a rookie hottie in the midst of developing.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the troublesome thing is that he's only interested in Mochizuki</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika alone…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"!Senpai's ex-boyfriend?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu, you don't know right, generic face! How pitiful. It was back in her first year, but they broke up because her ex went to study overseas, so maybe they will get back together?"</p>
<p class="null-p">W-W-What…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe that ex have become a true hottie now, so I will lower my expectations then! I will aim to form a reverse harem with all the hotties in school right now! Now that's decided, I don't have time to bother with Ito! Time for the hunt!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She turned valiantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh? Nakajima …san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, generic face Katou?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She reverted to calling me Katou again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't be talking to Katou again, that's why I turned back. So spit it out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm~, aren't you going to seal my lips? You know, like preventing me from blackmailing you about exposing your true nature or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I carelessly said something that the minions of the baddies would say.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san snorted, then placed the back of her palm on her chin, like the pose of an arrogant rich lady.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Generic face, huh? Even if generic face say something like that, the teachers and students-- our credibility in their mind are on a completely different league! Don't look down on the persona I built in order to realize my dream of a reverse harem! Laughable! There is no need to shut you up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying all that, Nakajima went down the stairs. I left the entrance and peeked downstairs. It seemed that Nakajima's friends just happen to came, and I saw the both of them there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Konoha, I finally found you~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I just wanted a change of scenery."</p>
<p class="null-p">She treated her female friend with her pure beauty persona. She looked back at me, and I locked gazes with the smiling Nakajima and felt my body shriek away.</p>
<p class="null-p">That should be a 【Heroine B????】right. There wasn't enough【?】.</p>
<p class="null-p">I immediately took out my phone. I returned to the classroom and continued the game-- Now that I thought about it, it was already too late. Maybe I could take this level of setback better if I had the preview to prepare me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I launched 【There are no heroines in my youth】.</p>
<p class="null-p">What happened earlier was also shown in the game. A choice branch appeared, but it was selected automatically, so I could only watch the events play out.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Sorry, I just wanted a change of scenery.】</p>
<p class="null-p">After the Nakajima in the game said this line, the screen turned black. From the countdown, the next gaming session would be after school… The all important preview turned into a review…!</p>
<p class="null-p">I have to pay more attention to the gaming time, I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4. 【Heroine C?】 is a friend?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's your name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one asking my avatar with a chirpy voice was a fashionable girl in casual clothes. Her clothing matched just like a model out of a fashion magazine. Her limbs were slender, and showed an appropriate amount of cleavage that had an impish charm about her. Even in the game, it couldn't be helped for my eyes to drift over there since I was a boy. Her shoulder length hair was dyed a rarely seen pink. Her makeup wasn't too thick, which brings out her androgynous beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">【T-T-Tosa, Tosa, Itsuki. 】【Tosa tosa? Tosa Itsuki right?】</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Okay, and I'm Fujikawa Kaname. Just call me Kaname. 】</p>
<p class="null-p">【…………】</p>
<p class="null-p">In response to the girl about my age-- and a boku girl[1] on top of that-- my avatar stopped and couldn't react when he was asked to address her by her name.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Ka, kakaka】</p>
<p class="null-p">I know, I know. If I was just reading it from the phone, I could call her Kaname. But in real life, I would act just like my avatar!</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring the repetitive and robotic 【ka】 sounds from my avatar, Kaname said:</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">【By the way, going by my principles, I can't pretend I didn't see that. You are planning to buy the clothes you placed inside your shopping basket right…?】</p>
<p class="null-p">When I realized it, Kaname's name had changed from 【???】 to</p>
<p class="null-p">【Heroine C? Fujikawa Kaname】... I already knew Rika-sama and Nakajima, and their names appeared in their dialogue box the moment we encounter.</p>
<p class="null-p">So people I didn't know in real life would be shown in such a way.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the next thing of note was, a third heroine appeared in the game! A girl that had nothing to do with the data I entered at the very beginning!</p>
<p class="null-p">I lift my head from the phone for a moment and stretched myself… I was too engrossed in the game. I tilted my neck in a stretch, phew-</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at the clock above the blackboard, the time displayed was already past 1700hrs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wednesday, the third day after school. It was rare for me to stay behind in class 2-2. I had the room to myself. When it was possible to play the game, I immediately started 【There are no heroines in my youth】. This was something I set for myself from the lesson I learned this afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I went home at the usual time, I think that the timer would drop to zero while I was still walking or on the train. And so, I stayed behind in the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, I wasn't in any club and didn't promise anyone to go home or visit some place together. Gon-chan and Kazuya both prioritize their girlfriends. The only thing left was the cleaning duties as a campus beautification committee member that took just a bit of time. Speaking of which, I think I was told that there had been more littering during the student council election period…</p>
<p class="null-p">I returned my gaze to Kaname's lines on the phone screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">The choice branch after school on Wednesday was something like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Hurry home and chat with other players together with Grandpa in the latest FPS【Hell·Scream 4】.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Shop for clothes at 【Train】.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Puppurapu?】</p>
<p class="null-p">It has to be the second option! I didn't see that Puppura thing!</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, I selected "Shopping for clothes".</p>
<p class="null-p">It was plain and simple for a course of action, but not that normal for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Train】-- shopping for clothes there… Just the name of the shop had an obviously different atmosphere from the usual shopping center where I usually buy my clothes, a place I never visited. Because I just needed my uniform for clothes. Or my tracksuit. I had never went on a date before too! I didn't have the chance to wear fashionable clothes! By the way, the very act of shopping for clothes… I had only done so with my Grandpa in April, when I bought a tracksuit for about a 1000 yen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Asking me to shop for clothes in a fashionable shop… That was something I usually wouldn't do…</p>
<p class="null-p">Following my selection, my avatar headed for 【Train】. That seemed to be a franchise popular among youths as the latest in fashion trends. I saw a few students wearing the same uniform as me. My avatar entered the shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Going into that place as if it was nothing, my avatar was… a scary person…!</p>
<p class="null-p">I was only intimidated for a moment. I was relieved when I saw my avatar selecting his merchandize quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The screen showed the clothes that my avatar was planning to buy, and every one of them was a choice that puts me at ease. The clothes seemed to be the kind I would choose myself. I would be able to choose from the ones that was selected. My avatar, you and I were the same person after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar then put the clothes into the basket. A matching pair of pants and jacket.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the narration 【a girl is looking at Tosa Itsuki】 popped up, Kaname then talked to my avatar with the line: 【I have something to tell you】.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright, I already stretched, so time to pull myself together-- And end the break time! Continue with the game. I tapped the screen. After that Kaname's dialogue was displayed: 【Those clothes--】.</p>
<p class="null-p">【are dull】</p>
<p class="null-p">【……! 】</p>
<p class="null-p">I could feel the wavering my silent avatar was feeling. Kaname's lines were dubbed. Because she was dubbed, I started to waver just like my avatar.</p>
<p class="null-p">【This might be none of my business, but I can't stay silent anymore. Tosa-kun, are you making yourself dull on purpose? The clothes inside that basket wouldn't match well, they will look ugly on you. You need to buy cooler clothes… Do you have time? Try on every piece of clothes in the basket. After doing that, come out and let me take a look. 】</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, the scene changed and my avatar went to the changing room. My avatar tried out the clothes… The images of my avatar in those clothes were shown one after another on the screen. This was the first time I saw my avatar in the game, and he just had a generic hairstyle and body shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hmm, it feels like I was slightly behind the curve compared to the trending fashion right now…? That was about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Alright, I will take a shot with my camera. Good, take them off and try the clothes I picked.】</p>
<p class="null-p">After opening the curtains of the changing room, Kaname inspected my dressing and took my photo, and I returned to the changing room once more. It will take some time in real life, but the clothes were changed immediately once I tap the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Trying on the clothes for the second time.</p>
<p class="null-p">【……! 】</p>
<p class="null-p">"……! "</p>
<p class="null-p">I was in sync with my avatar. My hair and body remained the same, but I had obviously changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Hmmm, just like I imagined. Alright, I will take some photo. Well, let's compare the difference.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I pulled out the before and after photo, and placed them on either side of my phone screen. If I had to give a score, the combination my avatar and I chose was 40 points. Kaname's choices was 100 points, that was how wide the gulf was.</p>
<p class="null-p">【The clothes Kaname chose is better...】</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar actually said the name of a girl he met for the first time without stuttering! And he didn't have a Recycling bag over his head! And wasn't weirded out by a carnivorous girl and gotten used to it…! I have to work hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Isn't that so? Hehe.】</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar bought the 100 points clothes… It wasn't that expensive either. I could buy it all with the money I had in my wallet-- At this moment, the screen turned dark and the countdown appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">I got up from my seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, Pandora! "</p>
<p class="null-p">I said to my partner. The installed AI Pandora, would always answer as long as the phone was charged, even if there wasn't internet.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Here.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to go to this 【Train】 shop! "</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to meet with 【Heroine C?】 Kaname in real life! I never heard of this shop name before, but since it was in the game, it should be nearby!</p>
<p class="null-p">【-- There isn't any clothing line by that name near Honami High School】</p>
<p class="null-p">…Ehh? Huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora-chan, are you serious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【I'm serious.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Like Pandora said, I couldn't find that place even when I search on the net.</p>
<p class="null-p">The clothing shop 【Train】 didn't exist!</p>
<p class="null-p">So the place I would meet Kaname didn't exist.</p>
<p class="null-p">【This should be the effect of the error code. The name might be different, it should be fine if you visit a similar shop.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm, as for similar shops..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I went to the busiest subway station in the vicinity. The surrounding area had plenty of shopping malls and high class condos. There were many national chain franchises and niche fashion stores here too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it had chain stores with the latest fashion designs, popular among youths of both genders and frequented by many Honami High School students, this should be the place.</p>
<p class="null-p">After exiting from the ticket barrier and leaving the crowd, I looked at my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fast fashion[2], shops where you could buy fashionable clothes at a bargain.</p>
<p class="null-p">I would be visiting the shops I knew and searched for fast fashion shops around the station. There were 【Shimamura】, 【Union】, 【K·U】, 【Dark On】, 【Muji】.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well… If my luck was bad, I would need to visit every one of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's start with 【Shimamura】…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Calculating from our current position, the most efficient route would be 【K·U】【Muji】【Union】then 【Shimamura】. As 【Shimamura】 is the furthest away, we will lose a lot of time if 【Shimamura】 is the correct answer. Going with the reverse route and starting with 【Shimamura】 is a viable way, but considering Itsuki's character, you will probably opt for the the cautious and efficient method of starting with the nearest place. That's why I suggest this route.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I will start with 【K·U】 then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Time was short, so I began my search for the shop… in the end, even 【Shimamura】 I visited last wasn't that shop, and I returned to the station again. It was a complete miss. The clothes in the game couldn't be found in any of the shops. It had been 5 minutes since my avatar was supposed to meet with Kaname.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Sorry.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I sighed deeply while holding my phone, and Pandora said softly.</p>
<p class="null-p">【If only I can find the correct location of 【Train】… I'm not worthy of being a support AI.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no no! It's not strange that you couldn't do that! Don't get so down!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【But…】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Think about it, you are the one who told me that the shop 【Train】 didn't exist, right? I would have wasted more time without this information. You have been a big help! So Pandora, don't be so depressed! "</p>
<p class="null-p">【… Alright. Itsuki is consoling me, our positions have switched huh. Okay, I won't be depressed anymore. Next time, I will be the one to comfort Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh, I prefer to not have anything happen to me that would require me to be comforted…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【In order to avoid that, let's work hard.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. Did we missed out any fast fashion shops…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sight of a couple wearing uniforms from my High School visiting a shop that had just opened entered my field of vision. I followed them with my gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the couple entered the shop, my eyes opened wide when I saw the clothes display window. I had an impression of the clothes over there. That jacket! It was the same design as the one Kaname placed inside my basket. So this was the place?</p>
<p class="null-p">【It seemed to have just open today. Searching on the net yield no results, but there is a notice on the store's homepage.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I took a look at the store name. 【WEGA·Wiga】. The only thing it had in common with 【Train】 was the usage of English alphabets. So this was the place… It was definitely here. And so, I entered the shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I could find the clothes my avatar chose… I picked up a basket and started browsing the clothes. Starting with a shirt… Found it!</p>
<p class="null-p">This was definitely the 【Train】 inside the game. Amend it to 【WEGA·Wiga】, prediction system!</p>
<p class="null-p">Really now… I composed myself and started picking out clothes just like I did in the game, the only thing that worries me was being late. To make myself more prominent, I wandered around the shop randomly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have something to tell you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Fortunately, Fujikawa Kaname was here. Next, Kaname will ask</p>
<p class="null-p">【What's your name?】,</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's your name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I told her my name…</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">I should tell her my name, but I remember I didn't do so smoothly. Oh no, I only remember that much. Because I was only thinking about finding this shop, I forgot my lines.</p>
<p class="null-p">Turn on the phone on power saving mode! Pandora! Pandora could definitely do it! She would definitely know what I was thinking! Come on out, my cheat sheet!</p>
<p class="null-p">The lines came out with a snap.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, Pandora! Nice, Pandora!</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-T-Tosa , Tosa , Itsuki. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa tosa? Tosa Itsuki, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded as I looked at the cheat sheet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, and I'm Fujikawa Kaname. Just call me Kaname. "</p>
<p class="null-p">According to the sheet, I stopped here momentarily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ka, kakaka"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, going by my principles, I can't pretend I didn't see that. You are planning to buy the clothes you placed inside your shopping basket right…? Those clothes-- are dull."</p>
<p class="null-p">I need to turn silent at this point and sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">After this, for the first time in reality, I looked at Kaname calmly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ehh…?</p>
<p class="null-p">I noticed something different from the game. Be it Rika-sama or Nakajima, the difference between the portrait and reality wasn't too big. Rika-sama's sexy body in reality was shown perfectly in the drawings, the same goes for the pure beauty Nakajima. Their voices were the same too.</p>
<p class="null-p">As for Kaname-- her hair colour and voice was just like the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">My eyes drifted to Kaname's chest. Kaname's casual clothing was the same… except for one small difference.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kaname in real life wore warm yellow clothes, and the design was the same as the game, but there was something right below her neck-- Girls would understand, right? She was wearing sweater and hotpants, as the sweater fitted her body snuggly, it emphasized Kaname's breast despite it being very boyish. However, her cleavage was well hidden. It didn't have the beauty of being a little revealing. Was this due to the error code?</p>
<p class="null-p">But even if I took a hundred steps back and ignore the cleavage that wasn't visible, her breast… that was quite voluptuous had disappeared. Was those fakes?</p>
<p class="null-p">I recall the portrait in my mind -- Wrong!</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no such thing. The portrait's feel and wobble of the breast was definitely the real thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was strange. I stared at the part which was different from the game-- Kaname's breasts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I tilted my head</p>
<p class="null-p">…Or rather, before we talk about the size and the amount of skin being revealed, wasn't it crooked?</p>
<p class="null-p">The left breast was sliding down. Noticing my gaze, Kaname looked down at her own body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh no."</p>
<p class="null-p">She muttered, and pulled at the collar of her sweater.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is a pathway! The middle of a pathway!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's true. Hurry up then, come with me too Tosa-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">We headed to the part of the shop where the merchandize was less eye catching. However, when we reached there, Kaname pulled open her collar without hesitation. If she did that here--</p>
<p class="null-p">I would see things I shouldn't be able to see!</p>
<p class="null-p">And then… Her chest was flat?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname then reached into the open space with her right hand in plain sight. She then corrected the position(?) of her breast(?) to the right spot. She probably thought it was hard to adjust it this way, so she took her left breast out.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Pads.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Done."</p>
<p class="null-p">After moulding her pad into the correct shape, she put it back on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Erm, it's straight now..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? I was in a bit of a hurry today, that was careless of me to not do a final inspection with a full mirror. That won't do."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname took out a folding mirror and checked herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, my appearance as a girl is the prettiest! Don't fall for me now! --Tosa-kun, what's the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your, breast."</p>
<p class="null-p">Your breast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Breast? Ahh, what about them…? Oh right, since I'm expose, I have a question. How does it feels to the touch? I think this pad isn't bad for a fake breast."</p>
<p class="null-p">My hand was grabbed over and brought to Kaname's chest. I didn't have any experience in touching the breasts of a girl before, but, this one would fall off if I touch it right… Why wasn't there so much as a soft bulge behind the pads? Why wasn't it that much different from my chest?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's out of shape again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname hurriedly adjusted the pad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ermm…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname pulled open the collar of her sweater again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Kaname, you are... "</p>
<p class="null-p">The right breast that had fallen onto her stomach was fished out by Kaname's hand, and pushed to the right place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…… a boy, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. My pads slipped so it can't be helped. That was really bad, but no one else saw through me. After all, my cuteness is on the level of one in a hundred. There, done, okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname's fake breasts were ready. Her slender body looked even skinnier</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cross dressing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A problem that wasn't anything like the conversation in the game was happening right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's a proper term for this, a trap, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Something about wanting to be a girl and falling in love with boys, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? I like girls, and don't want to be one either. I might look this way, the symbol of a man between my legs is still there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you're cross dressing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, because of my height…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if he was saying that was hard to accept, Kaname shrugged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm a boy, but I'm just 157cm tall… What do you think? Just tell me your honest thoughts."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm… you're quite short."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that right!? Too short! I think my looks isn't that bad. But I'm too short, and the boy's clothes I want to wear don't suit me at all! Even if I wore thick soles shoes, it doesn't really fit. No matter how I wear them, I would look cute! That isn't what I want! I'm not compatible with boy's clothes! And I spent my days miserably..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay…."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so, I got it. Why not go for cuteness all the way. And that's how I am now."</p>
<p class="null-p">So he started going out dressed like a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname laughed quietly. Aside from the size of his chest, he had the same face as Kaname in the game. No matter how I looked, he was just like a girl that was pleasing to the eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have an androgynous face, so I look my best not as a boy, but as a girl. Since then, I have always worn girl's clothes for casual attire. And of course, I toned down my boyish behavior and it suits me even better. I have to act like a girl when cross dressing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. It looks good on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">His clothes suiting him was one thing, but Kaname pointed at my basket regarding a different matter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa-kun, the clothes you're buying is completely out. I even thought you wanted to make yourself ugly. These are all dull clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">You should buy cool ones instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">The development was the same huh… there wasn't any need to mimic my avatar's lines anymore. Pandora's cheat sheet was gone anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Even though we just met, can I ask you to pick out clothes for me,</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeling weak, I said what was on my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! "</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname placed his hands behind him and nodded with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, just leave it to me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for shopping with us, we hope to see you again."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the store clerk settled our purchases, I picked up the shopping bag with my clothes inside and left 【WEGA Wiga】.</p>
<p class="null-p">The clothes Kaname picked for me was the same as the game, something that would change my image elegantly. Kaname was very sociable, although he had the weird side of cross dressing because it suited him, he could hold a good conversation. He received a call from home and needed to go, so he left after saying "let's have a good chat if we meet again."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Pandora-Chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood at the walkway at the entrance of 【WEGA Wiga】, raised the phone to my face and said:</p>
<p class="null-p">"……That's a guy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Meeting and getting to know Kaname was great, and I felt we would be friends if we met again.</p>
<p class="null-p">【……】</p>
<p class="null-p">But, but. The problem was his gender.</p>
<p class="null-p">--【Heroine C?】is a trap, alright?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora-chan! "</p>
<p class="null-p">【…The entity Fujikawa Kaname was probably assigned as a girl in the prediction, and the game will probably continue to treat him as such. This is something that should be corrected when the game starts… Since the correction hasn't been made, this may be the effect of the error code. I can't interfere with the prediction, so the difference between the game and real Fujikawa Kaname will probably…】</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will go on like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kaname in the game was a girl. The Kaname in reality was a trap.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though he's a trap, he is still【HeroineC?】?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes… Give it up… Please don't cry, Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">My nose felt a little itchy as I shed tears in my heart. Pandora's concern was right on point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora, please go out with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">My companion that treated me so gently was already a heroine, right? Definitely a heroine, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">【That's a little...】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got dumped…! "</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki is my favorite amongst the humans.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt touched and looked at my phone. However…</p>
<p class="null-p">"--The only humans Pandora knew and spoke to are me and Grandpa, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. I like Itsuki's grandfather second best.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"You like me the most because your choices were limited from the start..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't know whether I should cry or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">【N-No matter how many people there are, Itsuki will still be my favourite, alright? This is my raison d'etre. Understanding Itsuki and being Itsuki's comrade is my priority. No matter how much of a bum Itsuki is, what fetish and sick interest you have, I have been programmed to accept all that.】</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that Pandora was kicking me while I was down…</p>
<p class="null-p">【… Ah!】</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【I reported this situation as a system error to the main server, and the operations side sent a reply specially for Itsuki. Please confirm the content.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me see..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I launched 【There are no heroines in my youth】. What appeared was the title screen. There was a NEW icon on the top right corner.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Notification for Tosa Itsuki-san. We apologize for any</p>
<p class="null-p">inconvenience that arises because of error code 000000000000000000000. Normally, our organization would not be responsible for any losses if the player insisted on continuing the game in spite of the error code. However, we will make a special exception this time and provide a function that are still in the experimental stage as compensation. It unlocks the function of the support AI. The first usage will be available for 24 hours at 0 sols, please make full use of this function. To unlock the function, please tap 【here】. After the function has been unlocked, a new item will be added to the instruction manual.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, do you know anything about this, Pandora?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【No, I shouldn't have any unlockable functions...】</p>
<p class="null-p">"0 Sols huh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The nightmare from forced reparation came to mind. And this was a function still in the experimental stage. Could it be, since there was someone who continued the game despite the appearance of an error code, they were using this chance to make me debug their product since they wouldn't be held responsible even if something happened! Killing two birds with one stone! That was the kind of scheme this was, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was troubling over it,</p>
<p class="null-p">【Erm, Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora who was usually passive said timidly:</p>
<p class="null-p">【Could you please unlock the function?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora wants me to unlock the function?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. I am very intrigued.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I see….</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then--"</p>
<p class="null-p">If Pandora wants to, I didn't have any reason to object. Leaving the debug issue aside, it costs 0 Sols and last for just 24 hours.</p>
<p class="null-p">I clicked on the 【here】 as indicated by the line 【To unlock the function, please tap here】.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stared at my phone for a few seconds… Nothing happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki, please look to your side.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Following Pandora's instruction, I turn towards a foreigner girl standing to my right. Silver hair and amber eyes that looked golden. She wants me to talk to her…? She was wearing a Honami High School uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">W-Was there such a student? If there was, she would be as well known as Rika-sama and Nakajima… Slightly shorter than me and a face that gave a little fantastical feeling, a very beautiful girl. She was beautiful… But her expression seem to have an aura of being inorganic. It was somewhat different from being expressionless.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's eyes fell on me.</p>
<p class="null-p">【It's me, Itsuki. Can you tell?】</p>
<p class="null-p">In concert with Pandora's voice, the soft lips of the girl moved.</p>
<p class="null-p">New texts appeared on the phone screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Visualization of the support AI has been unlocked.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I opened my eyes wide and the phone slipped from my right hand. The silver haired girl moved quickly, and caught it before it reached the ground. She made it in time, her hand intercepted the falling trajectory of the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">However-- the phone passed through that hand, making a soft sound as it fell on the pavement.</p>
<p class="null-p">【As someone had entered the tracks, our staff is in the midst of investigating it right now. We are sorry for the delay and inconvenience. We appreciate your patience before we resume operation --】</p>
<p class="null-p">The fourth day, 29th September. A staff announcement was broadcasted inside the morning commute train. A short moment later, Pandora's voice came from the ear piece connected to my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【How intriguing. Why is he apologizing?】</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_14.jpg">
<p class="null-p">I typed into my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Theoretically, there was nothing to apologize for.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday, after we left 【WEGA·Wiga】, Pandora's visualization function was unlocked, and I had been bombarded by her curious questions. She claimed that she didn't experience any change aside from becoming visible, but that wasn't so. Compared to her time when she was just a voice, she was obviously speaking a lot more. The number of people around us didn't faze her at all, and it was troubling to handle.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tried to change Pandora's voice setting to off at the start. I did this often in the past to make Pandora's words appear as text on the screen. But that didn't work now.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Pandora had hijacked my phone's rights. This was like a mandatory message from 【Smile】, more intense than Kazuya's boasting his lovelife.</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, I would only turn on the sound when no one else was around and speak with Pandora openly. When there was other people, I would turn off the sound. But in a messy setting like a train, it was quite easy to chat with Pandora since no one knew me, and I would turn on Pandora's sound. I would plug in an ear piece to the phone and type my reply into the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I decided on this before heading to school on the morning of the fourth day,</p>
<p class="null-p">【Because those in a rush will feel annoyed about the delay. Even though they have important work to do, they couldn't do so as they were stuck in a train, which deepens such sentiments. They will become angry at the cause of the delay, and being stuck in a train will make them even more anxious. That's why the staff apologized for the delay to soothe the passenger's emotions, and they would be more willing to accommodate them. 】</p>
<p class="null-p">I finished typing.</p>
<p class="null-p">【What an irrational logic.】</p>
<p class="null-p">She said in a 'humans are weird' kind of tone. I looked at Pandora's expressionless face. She didn't show any of the emotion she invested in her voice. A girl who seemed to be in college and grabbing onto a hanging strap probably felt she was being stared at and raised an eyebrow. I hurriedly averted my gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a problem that only I could see Pandora.</p>
<p class="null-p">With reference to the new item 【Regarding the Visualization Function】 that I had read plenty of times.</p>
<p class="null-p">【The AI's visualization function was developed in response to the feedback by many customers. The AI won't be limited to just their voices, and will grant them a human appearance too. It's as they are really there, you can see them, and they can move and interact with you too.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora who was standing to the side seemed to be drawn towards something, and walked to the next train compartment. Pandora, would you really be fine…? But she wasn't troubling others physically, and couldn't do so anyway. Even though I knew that, I still couldn't calm down. She could move and converse with me, just like a real person. She couldn't float in the air and her legs were on the ground though.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">What she was drawn to was the cage on the lap of a person sitting there… there was a puppy in there. Pandora reached out, and the puppy reached its paw out from the cage. However, it missed. The puppy could see her too? Or sensed her? She shouldn't be tangible at all, but its paw moved up and down as if it was touching Pandora.</p>
<p class="null-p">【However, only the player--Tosa Itsuki-san can sense the AI's human form. Please note that the AI was an existence that appears to be there, but doesn't physically exist.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora that was playing with the puppy was passed through by a salaryman walking by.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Furthermore, the effective range of the visualization is 10m from the phone. The visualization effect will be lost beyond this range.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I did thought about giving the support AI a portrait or something. But the expectations had risen too far all of a sudden…</p>
<p class="null-p">And if the visualization went on, I wouldn't be able to afford the Sols.</p>
<p class="null-p">After unlocking the function, 【There are no heroines in my youth】 was upgraded to a version that would allow visualization to be turned on at any time. Amongst the icon on the top right corner which includes the instruction manual, the visualization option was added beneath Pandora's voice on/off select.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it cost 1000 Sols per minute. Not 100… but 1000.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, I could use this function for 24 hours for 0 Sols, but the normal charges would be 1,440,000 Sols. 1,440,000 Sols, I couldn't afford it even if I took out my entire possible loan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did the other players possess that many Sols? Was their potential loan 10 million Sols…? Just when I had such a doubt…</p>
<p class="null-p">【Sorry for the wait. Our staff have located and brought the trespasser away from the tracks, this train will resume operation shortly.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The broadcast announced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like the preview. According to the preview, my avatar's Thursday morning will start with a train delay. After operation resumed 【Heroine C? Fujikawa Kaname】 would board at the next stop, and we would meet again. I would learn that Kaname was attending the same school and in the same year as me. We had a lively chat, and my avatar exchanged 【Smile】 ID. It was a good atmosphere, but that development was limited to the game…</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Kaname was a girl in the game, but a trap in real life!</p>
<p class="null-p">The Kaname in the game was in female uniform, with a skirt and hair accessory. The school uniform was generic and wasn't tailored in anyway, but she felt very fashionable.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, in reality… What would happen when I meet Kaname again. Well, I got on the same train as my avatar-- even though I just took the train at my usual spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">I arrived at the stop where Kaname should be boarding. The automatic doors opened to the left and right, and the passengers alighted one after another. Several Honami High School students got on the train… The girls… ignore them for now. The boys…</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora who was still playing with the puppy asked through my earpiece.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki, aren't you going to talk to Fujikawa Kaname?】</p>
<p class="null-p">When we first met, Kaname started talking to me. In our second meeting in the game, my avatar talked to Kaname with a【A-Ah, Allo! 】</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't plan to chat him up this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">I started looking around me. There were several Honami High School boys standing near the entrance. Was he there…? Be it a men's wear or female wear… Even if he revert back to a normal guy, I still remember Kaname's face. A youth with a pretty face. Was there someone like that here?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa-kun, we are in the same train. And we are the same year in the same high school too. "</p>
<p class="null-p">A guy I have never seen before talked to me. It was someone I ruled out since I thought he wasn't Kaname. First, his hair colour was different from her, and looked dull even to me. He was the type who covers his face with his fringe. He wore glasses that nerds in manga would wear. I wouldn't hate him because he was nerdy. But he was that Kaname who transformed the dull me elegantly. The Kaname who strive for the most beautiful female dressing?</p>
<p class="null-p">I took off my earpiece. To be sure, I asked again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Who are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really now, it's Kaname."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fujikawa?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's Kaname."</p>
<p class="null-p">I scanned the person claiming to be Fujikawa Kaname from top to bottom, then to the top again. He was wearing male uniform and his tie was the same colour as mine, meaning he was a second year too.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was about Kaname's height. However, there wasn't any semblance with Kaname at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">At most, I felt their voice was similar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why this hair style and the glasses?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew Kaname was a boy, but he was dressed intentionally to suppress his good side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't like my appearance in a boy's uniform."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because if I show my face and style my hair I will become a cute male high schooler that is not here nor there. For me! That is! N.G! " "N.G…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N.G. If boys can wear girl's uniform, I will definitely wear a skirt and put on light makeup. But it isn't allowed. I can only attend school in boy's uniform. No matter how I try, I couldn't achieve the male style I want. Even if I go for cuteness, it is still one step away, unforgivable! My appearance as a boy is too far from my ideal!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, he concluded:</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is why I can't accept how I look in a uniform…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was a mentality I couldn't fathom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, I'm from class 3. What about you, Tosa-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Class 2."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Class 2 huh. I don't know much people there. I do have lots of friends in class 1… For class 2, I would know more people from the third year's class 2."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Third years huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. A student called Amamiya Keisuke will be transferring to class 3-2 today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah… right. I heard about that before."</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew about it. I shouldn't have known, but I got this information because of the game's preview last night. This was the thing that Nakajima mentioned. Amamiya Keisuke was Rika-sama's ex-boyfriend that went to study abroad at the end of his first year. Ex-boyfriend… huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">But the information was too limited. On day three, after I parted</p>
<p class="null-p">ways with Kaname, I could only play the preview until reaching school on the morning of the fourth day. It then switched to the familiar countdown screen. And the prediction today elegantly ignored the part about Pandora becoming visible… There wasn't even a narration about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa-kun. To~Sa~kun"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry. What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's exchange 【Smile】 ID, didn't you hear me? I wanted to say that yesterday, but I forgot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">We exchanged IDs. If… If only Kaname was a girl… I would have already reached the exciting stage of confirming her as a heroine. Starting as friends and becoming a couple! -- That was just an impractical delusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora who walked over expressionlessly looked at me at me and Kaname. Pandora's lips moved. The earpiece… had already been removed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">Making friends wasn't a bad thing. And Kaname was a type I had never seen before.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Kaname and I went to school together. Soon, we reached the school gate.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the route my avatar took too. However, Kaname in the game was a cute girl, and my avatar stutter a lot… The Kaname in reality was a boy, and for some reason Kaname wouldn't back down from, he intentionally dressed in a nerdy manner. So there wasn't any reason for me to stutter.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nakajima Konoha! Please cast a fair vote for Nakajima Konoha! "</p>
<p class="null-p">We reached the school gates, and because the election date was near, there were rallies and activities being held.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though the train was delayed, but just like the preview, I got up early because of my grandfather's effort in playing 【Hell·Scream 4】. I took three trains earlier than usual, so the delay wasn't a big deal.</p>
<p class="null-p">During this period, the student council candidates would carry out their election activities. Yesterday, Nakajima's opponent set up shop at the area around the school gate. Today, Nakajima was here too.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were several female students supporting Nakajima, and giving out election fliers. A female student came before me and Kaname and gave one to us.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Sincere and Earnest】</p>
<p class="null-p">Sincere and Earnest. That was the slogan I guess. Personally, I think that was something distant for Nakajima…</p>
<p class="null-p">I did plan to vote for Nakajima, but the election didn't matter much to me. The student council president, vice-president, general affairs and accountant would be elected. That might be so, aside from the student council president, everyone else just needed confidence votes.</p>
<p class="null-p">In short, the point of the election was to pick the student council president. It might be a one on one competition between Nakajima and the male student who was also in his second year, Nakajima was more or less the shoe-in candidate. I didn't even know the name of her opponent. I did see him yesterday, but it was just a glance during election period.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can you give me a pamplet about the policies?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Similar to the game, Kaname walked to the girl who was near the slogan banner.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, we will come into contact with Nakajima--.</p>
<p class="null-p">I remembered what happened in the game preview.</p>
<p class="null-p">The beautiful Nakajima was in her wolf in sheep skin mode, and had a friendly chat with Kaname. My avatar was treated like part of a scenery with only lines of 【……】. At this moment, Kaname headed towards the campus after saying she had class duties. My avatar who maintained his dialogue of 【……】 was greeted by the smiling Nakajima with a 【Good morning】. A choice branch appeared here.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Greet her back with a "Good morning". 】</p>
<p class="null-p">【"O-Ooooohhhha! " stutter timidly.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【"Good morning, Nakajima-san. The reverse harem topic we discussed yesterday was very interesting", identify yourself sarcastically.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I could only choose option number three here. Work hard, my avatar! With that in mind, I selected that option when I play the game last night. If I chose it in the game, I would need to follow through in reality. I was put down by Nakajima yesterday, so I bore a grudge against her…! The second choice suit my style well, but I would never choose it! Retard!</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, my avatar spoke to Nakajima sarcastically. However, in the game, Nakajima… remembered speaking to me, but couldn't remember my avatar's name. That's why she said 【Good morning】 to me with a smile. I didn't realized that immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima fell into deep thought and tilted her head with a 【……?】, and observed me with narrowed eyes. Finally! Finally, she said quietly:</p>
<p class="null-p">【Generic face… Mano?】.</p>
<p class="null-p">That concluded my recollection of the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same thing will probably happen in real life. However, how would things turn out with the difference in Kaname's gender…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Policies huh, do you want the detailed one or the brief one?" "Please give me the detailed version. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please wait a moment. Konoha! He wants a policy booklet! "</p>
<p class="null-p">The female student called for Nakajima. I saw Nakajima picked up an A4 sized booklet about 1cm thick piled on top of a chair nearby. She walked this way… Eh, Pandora was looking at the pile of booklets. Even though she was just walking behind us, she was suddenly there? As I was chatting with Kaname and wasn't checking my phone or wearing the earpiece, I didn't have the time to check on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, here you go, thank you..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima proffered him the booklet. Kaname started flipping through it immediately, which stopped Nakajima mid sentence, and she stared hard at Kaname.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her lips moved. I knew from instinct what she was saying. Hottie. It couldn't be anything else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima actually saw through Kaname's real appearance, despite his intentional dull dressing to hide himself…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she caught the scent of a hottie…? So all that she said before wasn't just hot air… What a scary woman, Nakajima Konoha……!</p>
<p class="null-p">A sense of defeat seized me. I felt that I have acknowledge something that I mustn't accept.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are really enthusiactic about this, thank you. School year… you are from the second year right? Mr..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima's eyes seemed to be flashing.</p>
<p class="null-p">…Hunt? Was this a hunt? Was Nakajima… planning to turn Kaname into a member of her reverse harem, and hunt him? Even though in the game Nakajima wasn't too interested in another girl! As expected, the difference in gender had a huge effect!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ka……"</p>
<p class="null-p">If Kaname continues, his name would be exposed to Nakajima.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey ya!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kaname turned his head at my shout. Nakajima's angry gaze pricked me painfully for an instant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you have class duties today? You should hurry on to your classroom! "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, that's right… Erm, did I mention about my class duty to Tosa-kun before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes you did! "</p>
<p class="null-p">During the preview in my game.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, thank you very much. See you later, Tosa-kun. "</p>
<p class="null-p">He nodded at Nakajima with a booklet in hand, and headed towards the campus.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good morning, Nakajima-san...! The reverse harem topic we discussed yesterday was very interesting."</p>
<p class="null-p">The first part was spoken loudly, and the second half was much softer. I greeted Nakajima,</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima's eyes as she stared at me in silence seemed anxious and angry. She opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Generic face… Mano! "</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Nakajima regained her composure in no time. A smile appeared on her lips. She returned to the booklet pile and brought one over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please take one too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since she offered one, I accepted it. Although I wanted to take it, Nakajima held on and didn't let go. What was Nakajima trying to do. She smile as she spoke softly. She maintained her wolf in sheep's skin appearance, but her tone exposed her true nature.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The generic face from yesterday… How dare you disrupt my meeting with a pretty face hottie I just discovered..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"He's my friend…! I won't let my friend be hunted right before my eyes..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I rebuked her unyieldingly in a quiet voice. I was being strong about it, unlike my usual self! Probably because my impression of Nakajima took a 180° turn, so I wasn't nervous when I spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ara, so you are a guy who prefers men, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No…! "</p>
<p class="null-p">No way! Why did she come to such a conclusion here!? It was true that Kaname had the potential of becoming a heroine. I felt complicated about that, but that definitely wasn't it--!</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if I shout here, I would be the one being forced into a corner. I need to calm down here.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment, the crowd split apart. Ah… I came to my senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, after Kaname head to the campus, a short while later--</p>
<p class="null-p">Before I could recollect my memories, events in reality occurred just like the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Rika-sama and Amamiya had arrived in school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rika! "</p>
<p class="null-p">A male student called out to Rika-sama who was walking singlemindedly forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">The student taking part in the election rally, those listening to the rally and the students walking towards the school gates. As the mass of students gathered near the school gates, an empty space suddenly appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rika! "</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Rika-sama didn't stop and kept her lips tightly pursed. But her wrist was grabbed and she stopped. The high school boy who asked Rika-sama to stop and grabbed her hand was-- Amamiya Keisuke. Standing beside Rika-sama, they were a picturesque couple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't ignore me. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama turned back silently with her face lowered. Amamiya's well serious face turned gloomy, and he said:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give me a chance to explain, let me clear up that incident back then…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Unhand me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She froze the air with a voice that wasn't anything like the Rika-sama</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew. Amamiya who was left behind didn't pursue her, and slouched his shoulders as if he had given up. A male student who had a diagonal sash for student elections and appeared to know Amamiya spoke with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard the discussion between the students who witnessed this interaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is the first meeting between the Queen and Amamiya after such a long time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amamiya-kun, the one who studied abroad after the end of his first year, that Amamiya Keisuke? He's back huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That handsome guy is Amamiya? How pitiful…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is definitely Mochizuki-senpai who is in the wrong. He got scammed by the Queen…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I already saw these lines from the game. At this moment, a soft voice came from a different place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A true hottie…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima beside me wasn't holding the booklet anymore, and her overlapped hands were placed on her chest. Her passionate eyes were looking straight at Amamiya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unlike that disappointing generic face, the fresh handsome guy during his first year became a true hottie after returning from his studies abroad… No, the fresh handsome guy part must be a mistake…! Both that chiseled face and slightly hurt expression are great. His body looked tone and his height is 180cm… alright, no time to waste. I need to create a nice atmosphere quickly and confess to him today…! "</p>
<p class="null-p">She said in a very quiet voice. Only I, who was standing beside Nakajima could hear her… probably…</p>
<p class="null-p">The game only brushed it off with the narration 【Nakajima Konoha seemed to be infatuated with Amamiya】, so that was how it should be in reality. It wasn't anything surprising after I hear it. However, I should bring Nakajima back to reality. Listening any further would be abusing my ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nakajima … san. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Generic face. You are still here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, still here. You got a problem with that!? However-- I couldn't even muster the strength to rebuke her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama and Amamiya were dating or something.</p>
<p class="null-p">I sighed. I stood there like a mosquito net quietly, just like what my avatar did.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama's attitude means she still like Amamiya or something. I thought about such unnecessary things. Assuming Rika-sama like Amamiya, what should I do?</p>
<p class="null-p">If that was true, I would have no chance of winning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even with the aid of 【There are no heroines in my youth】, the competition for Rika-sama would still be futile. His success rate must be above 98%, while I would get just 60% at best with the help of the game.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_15.jpg">
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5. My Avatar and The Real Me</p>
<p class="null-p">It was time for the second period. The third period was biology, and we need to shift to a different classroom. I arrived at the biology lab very early. I checked my watch and there was still 7 minutes before class begin. Most of my classmates weren't coming. Gon-chan and Kazuya both chose the Physics elective, but there was a reason why I came to the laboratory so early. No one else was around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sigh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【You are sighing a lot.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora's voice came from my earpiece. Pandora sat on a seat opposite me. She wasn't really sitting there, and was only appearing to.</p>
<p class="null-p">She acted just as if she was really there.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki, nine more seconds before you can resume the game.】</p>
<p class="null-p">After she finished, the numbers dropped down to 2, 1, then 0. Last night, I only played until the scene with Rika-sama and Amamiya. This time I got to proceed with the next preview earlier than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I didn't think any happy development with Rika-sama and Nakajima would be waiting for me… My avatar… but if I give up here, all of my encounters would be for nought, and I would need to experience forced reparation.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was supposed to meet Rika-sama, and if the game continues, it should cover that period.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tapped on the phone and the lesson continued, and skipped to the important parts. I hope the situation of the preview becoming a review would not happen again.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the situation was out of our expectations! I continued the game quickly with a speed that I had never used before while surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon, the bell indicating the start of class rang. The biology teacher walked to the laboratory, and all the students were present. As if she was asking me to act now, Pandora stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Teacher! "</p>
<p class="null-p">I pulled out my earpiece and stood up. I put one hand on my abdomen and held the textbook on my desk with the other. The biology teacher with round glasses said with a troubled tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa ! I'm Tosa ! I have a sudden stomache, please let me use the toilet and visit the infirmary!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, ahh… Tosa huh, go then."</p>
<p class="null-p">After receiving permission, I slipped to the entrance where Pandora was.</p>
<p class="null-p">I proceeded with the game as I ran. The earphone connected to my phone swayed in the air with a purappura sound. It was annoying, so I pulled it out. Sound came out from my phone as I continued. And so I switched the phone to vibration mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, the game and reality had almost zero time difference. If I dally just one bit, I wouldn't make it in time for the preview. But--</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the hell is this! "</p>
<p class="null-p">I was dumbfounded. According to the results from the choices-- This might be the only way to open up the situation-- My avatar deviated from reality, and went into dynasty warrior mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">Specifically speaking, I got into a fight with multiple male students and knocked them all down.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Well, I do have experience in beating down my enemies mercilessly, and wiping them out. I did that plenty of times with heavy firearms. The advent in technology was such a great thing. Even a game you have gotten sick of playing could be challenged again by setting your own handicap, such as limiting yourself to the default equipment or something… That's right, my experience in being OP was only limited to FPS games!</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar performed combos like a fighting game character, moved and jumped speedily like a ninja, and fought as if he had 3 heads and 6 arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-W-Whaaaa..."</p>
<p class="null-p">What the hell was this!?</p>
<p class="null-p">The place before me-- Was where I met Rika-sama, the deserted Second Courtyard where I picked up the tail plushy. No one was here. Timing wise, I made it here in time. But… Where should I hide. No, instead of that…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora! "</p>
<p class="null-p">【Please calm down Itsuki, getting anxious will just lead to failure.】 Pandora was calm and expressionless as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How can I calm down!? I was, no, my avatar was too overpowered, I couldn't do that in real life!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Human could become very strong through hard work or under dangerous circumstances, but this was already beyond that extreme. If I had experience as a delinquent, street fighter or learned self defense,</p>
<p class="null-p">I should be able to handle this. However, my past didn't have anything to do with all that.</p>
<p class="null-p">【You chose 【Rescue Rika, get into the fray（Requirement: Physical 100）】 correct…? Strange, did Itsuki really chose this?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Because the other two were;</p>
<p class="null-p">【Wait for someone else to come to her rescue.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Pretend I never saw anything.】</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, the more logical option would be 【Rescue Rika, get into the fray（Requirement: Physical 100）】. Be it on thinking on the spot or after careful consideration, this was the correct answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I'm sorry, my question was inadequate-- Is that your preferred choice?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I want to choose that!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Well, this is an option available for players if they expend Sols to receive a stimulant. In reality, the potency of the stimulant would be reflected too. Didn't it say (Requirement: Physical: 100)?】</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded, and wondered what all this was about.</p>
<p class="null-p">【In comparison, the physical abilities of Itsuki right now would be (Physical: 10)】</p>
<p class="null-p">I was so weak!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Usually, it is possible to achieve (Physical: 100) by expending Sols.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Expend Sols huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【As Itsuki is still in the early stage of the games… You can't access this function yet. Also… even if you want to use it...】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora was hesitant to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I want to use it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【In order to reach (Physical 100), you need to purchase 【Smart</p>
<p class="null-p">Drink】 from the game and use it to increase your stats, however,】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… However?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【It cost 30,000 Sols.】</p>
<p class="null-p">It was impossible in all sorts of way, I finally understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I think that this was the effect of the Error Code, which allowed you to choose an option that shouldn't be available to you. However, it won't be a good prediction of what is to come...】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, that pervert over there-- Hello, I don't know who you are chatting with, but class has already started."</p>
<p class="null-p">This voice… Nakajima Konoha? In her wolf in sheep skin mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned back and our eyes locked.</p>
<p class="null-p">W-Why was she here?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she didn't… appear in the game? Wait, when I was talking to Pandora just now, I must look like a strange guy from a third person perspective. Could it be, Nakajima was also on scene, but she was just hiding and my avatar didn't notice? Was this the influence of Pandora's visualization?</p>
<p class="null-p">Footsteps and voices came from the direction of the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh no, I have to hide-- I looked around the courtyard. There was two places covered with shrubs. I should be able to hide there. I ran that way, and Pandora followed me too. For some reason, Nakajima came with me too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, why are you following me too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I have some circumstances… --- Huh!? This voice-- And that crude attitude towards me, could be be, you are generic face Ito?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right! Ito! "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really now, apologizing to you is such a waste. By the way, Ito, staying there and acting as if you are talking to someone is creepy, alright? Thanks to you, I spoke in my real tone for a moment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because no one was around, that's why…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, didn't you have a recycling bag over your head the other time? That is..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--! "</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh shit ahhhh! I forgot!</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't have a recycling bag on me! R-Recycling bag… Without my recycling bag…</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though my avatar prepared it in the game!</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did I forget about it? Ahh!</p>
<p class="null-p">…Trash can. There's a trash can in the courtyard, right? There might be a recycling bag in there… I stood up, but squat down immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Rika-sama's figure appeared. She looked depressed, and was holding a tail plushy in her right hand. She did say it was something like an amulet to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Behind her were several male students. I saw one of them before this morning, he was the student council president candidate. The one with the diagonal sash and spoke with Amamiya.</p>
<p class="null-p">But now… I would be seen if I search for a recycling bag in the trash can now…</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima put her index finger onto her chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mochizuki Rika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She gave the feeling of being disappointed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why isn't it Amamiya-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Amamiya?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that Amamiya will skip class and come here. I will ignore the curse of the Second Courtyard for now. With just the two of us in the courtyard while class is in session, isn't that the perfect chance to confess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Student council president candidate is skipping class…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You skipped class too, right? And I have never been late or absent before. I have never skipped classes either. But in order to achieve my goal, I wouldn't mind sacrificing my lesson time… By the way, what's going on there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't hear what the male student and Rika-sama were saying. It was the same in the game, but my avatar would charge out a while later -- What about me? What should I do? Should I charge out? Even though I knew I couldn't rescue Rika-sama like a cool hero? And I didn't have a recycling bag. Other options flashed through my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I choose a different option? I tried that before. Back then, I managed to pull it off. Would it work this time too?</p>
<p class="null-p">"… regret…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"… tarded… huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are doing this on our own…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I could tell a little from the bits and pieces of their conversation. Nakajima nodded and commented:</p>
<p class="null-p">"This appears to be a rendezvous. But the face value of the one meeting Mochizuki Rika is… I couldn't tell who they are… Except for one guy… My opponent in the election, Kiritani who is sort of a hottie depending on the angle."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima could remember his name, which means-- the best looking guy in that group was Kiritani, who was also the male student I saw wearing a diagonal sash this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--No!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama's shrill and strong voice rang out. She held on to her tail plushy tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now-- The male student's attitude changed. Rika-sama backed away, but another male student was behind her, as if he was stopping her from escaping.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora stood before me and pointed to the phone I was holding in my hand. She wants me to look at the phone…?</p>
<p class="null-p">【It will probably-- be fine even if you don't go.】</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the text shown on it. Even though Pandora's voice was set to be on, it had turn off now. Pandora could change that by herself? No, instead of that, the content of the message was more important.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked up at Pandora confused. Pandora conveyed her thoughts to me via the phone again.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki can't do anything even if you go, even I can tell you will just be injured for nothing. The results will be the same, no matter whether you go or not.】</p>
<p class="null-p">What Pandora said was correct. But… But…</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, I hate this. Be it pretending to not see anything, or waiting for events to take their natural course. Even if I didn't go, Rika-sama would probably be safe.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I learned through the preview that when the Recycling bag guy charged in, Rika-sama would go:</p>
<p class="null-p">【Regist-san! 】</p>
<p class="null-p">And call out to me in relief. That showed how uneasy Rika-sama felt before all this. I could tell from the game. In real life, it was clear to me by the way she was desperately clutching that tail plushy.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Regist-san was there, Rika would be at ease. The Regist she was 'acquainted with', but had never seen his face before, an entity that was me but also wasn't me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ito?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't react to Nakajima's call and charged out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mochizuki-senpai! "</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any Recycling bags. So I had to cover my face with something else as I ran to Rika-sama's side. All the boys took a step back because of the strange way I appeared. Thanks to that, I could stand in front of Rika-sama as if I was protecting her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The 1cm thick policy booklet I got from Nakajima. It was thick and A4 sized, if I held it with in vertically with my left hand, it could cover my face just right, and serviceable as a mask. Not being able to use my left hand was an inconvenience, but it passed as a substitute for a Recycling bag. However, I couldn't see the front at all!</p>
<p class="null-p">"This voice… Regist-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A moment later, Rika-sama's baffled voice sounded out softly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for the strange way I came, I was still watching quietly from the side just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt a warm sensation on my back as she held onto my shirt. As if she was holding onto another amulet aside from the tail plushy.</p>
<p class="null-p">However-- If I couldn't see anything, that means I wouldn't be able to see what the other party was doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">I shifted the booklet I was using as a shield away a little. There were about 4 male students.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should we do now, they were asking each other with their eyes. Kiritani who was speaking with Rika-sama observed me cautiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you? Don't get in our way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A group of men ganging up on a girl is definitely a problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… We are just chatting, and have a request. "</p>
<p class="null-p">"A request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Mochizuki-san, please."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring my question, Kiritani said to Rika. However, Rika-sama didn't say a word.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is such a pain, let's just beat this fellow up and take Mochizuki with us."</p>
<p class="null-p">A burly male student suggested with a snap of his fingers. This line was just like the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Let's do that then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiritani agreed with him. The heavy punch of the burly male student landed on my abdomen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san! "</p>
<p class="null-p">A gasp came out from my throat. That was how a punch felt… I nursed my stomach with my right hand while covering my face with the booklet with my other hand. The presence behind me vanished as I was staggering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Our position changed. Rika-sama stood before me with her hands outstretched. Rika-sama's wrist was grabbed tightly by another student. I tried to stop them, but was hit by a second blow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unhand me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Rika-sama resisted, she was getting further and further from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought I would be hit several more times, but thankfully, he stopped his beating. It already took all I had to cover my face with the booklet and my knees on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hit his face with your next shot."</p>
<p class="null-p">I braced myself for the impact-- and the sound of something slashing through the wind echoed out. "Uwah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">That burly student yelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you a retard who will challenge a fight you have no hope of winning, generic face? Things like the courage of the weak needs to be dumped down the drain."</p>
<p class="null-p">……Nakajima ?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But being brave isn't a bad thing. Much better than those guys who bullies the weak."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are… Nakajima Konoha?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiritani said in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's me… You are Kiritani from class 4, right? My opponent in the student council president election is actually such a guy, how deflating. Well, what do you all want to do? If you want to fight, I don't mind taking you on. You saw how I sent that big guy flying with my kick right…? Get up generic face, it's tough if I don't have any support."</p>
<p class="null-p">I then whispered to her:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, I got up and stood beside Nakajima.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama, was seized by Kiritani's side. On the other side were Nakajima and me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… are the lot of you doing!? "</p>
<p class="null-p">Here comes a new challenger. I shifted the book slightly -- it was Amamiya Keisuke. He held his breath and glared at Kiritani's gang.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amamiya-san..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiritani's expression turned awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you trying to do to Rika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As if his courage waned after hearing that forceful tone, the male student grabbing Rika-sama let go of her wrist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are not trying to do anything violent… A retard just happened to get in our way..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I heard you guys called Rika out, but I have been searching for you because I didn't know exactly where that is-- stop it right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are just trying to create a chance for the two of you to speak..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you planning to drag Rika to me forcefully? Don't do such things… Rika, are you hurt?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the first to answer Amamiya's question was Nakajima .</p>
<p class="null-p">"It hurts! I'm almost at my limits…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She cried suddenly and collapsed onto the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because of them… My leg..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima looked up at Amamiya with moist eyes. He couldn't leave her like this, so as he kept one eye on Rika-sama he extended a hand out to Nakajima.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much, Amamiya-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima held Amamiya's outreached hand firmly..</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just to be safe, I want to visit the infirmary..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt deep gratitude towards Nakajima for lending me a hand in my time of need. But at this instant, I felt the same as Kiritani who was looking at Nakajima dumbfoundedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was probably thinking: No, you aren't hurt at all,</p>
<p class="null-p">"--I get it, Rika..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika shook her head with a stiff expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama walked towards me silently. I concealed my face with the booklet once more, covering my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Was she talking to me? Where to? However, I couldn't see anything so I couldn't move. But my face would be exposed to Rika-sama if I didn't have the booklet… As I was troubling over that, Rika-sama took my hand and clutched it tightly. I was dragged along with her, this means-- come with me?</p>
<p class="null-p">I could resist if I wanted to, but I still followed her. I peeked in front of me and Rika-sama's back filled the vision of my right eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Wait, Rika."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama tensed her face, and stared at Amamiya who was walking beside her. Amamiya whispered something into Rika-sama's ears. I could barely hear the contents. Amamiya then glanced at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted me to listen too?</p>
<p class="null-p">What Amamiya said was:</p>
<p class="null-p">--Rika. That guy is just the same as me anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">After Rika-sama heard that, I could feel her quivering through her hand that was holding mine tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, I was inside the 【One Person Club】's shed. On my request, Rika-sama gave me a brown rectangular bag inside the room, and I put it on… I finally feel at ease. The booklet felt too flimsy to me, and the calming effect of the paper bag was even better than the Recycling bag. The easiness of making holes in it was great too. Anyway, I will make the holes first.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama and I were sitting in our chairs, just like when we had lunch. However, the atmosphere was completely different from back then. Aside from my request for a bag, we didn't speak at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">And I only realized after coming here that the only possession I had was the booklet. My textbook and phone was left in the shrubs at the courtyard, I need to pick them up later.</p>
<p class="null-p">The phone was necessary, without it-- and the game preview, I didn't know what to say to Rika-sama at a tie like this. Right now, I only got to the preview of Rika-sama being harrassed by Kiritani's gang, and my avatar started dispatching them in dynasty warrior mode. Since the countdown wasn't displayed, I could continue the game if I had my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, ask Pandora for help… I thought about doing that, but when I opened my eyes wide, I couldn't see Pandora anywhere… That was only natural, the visualization function wasn't tied to me, but to the phone which had 【There are no heroines in my youth】 installed. It's range was 10m.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was a straight line, the distance from the courtyard to the 【One Person Club】 on the rooftop was definitely more than 10m. And so, I couldn't even get help from Pandora.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama finally spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-H-Here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tension from not knowing what to expect made me stutter again. "Thank you for your help. I am sorry for bringing you here… Even though Regist-san is badly hurt..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I lowered my head and waved my arms around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, i-it's nothing… It doesn't hurt that much anymore, and it wasn't that serious an injury."</p>
<p class="null-p">I wasn't putting on a false front. It hurt like hell when I was hit, but the pain subsided after some time had passed-- He probably held back or something? That burly guy seemed to be good at fighting and controlled his strength, that was probably it. In that case why did he held back?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I should have brought you to the infirmary..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama wanted to bring me to the infirmary, but I already know the reason why she didn't.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amamiya… senpai m-might be there, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving Nakajima who wasn't actually hurt aside and asked Amamiya to sent her there, Amamiya agreed to send her too. It was very hard for Amamiya to reject her given the circumstances. Nakajima was aiming for that when she made her request. It was probably to create a chance for the two of them to be alone together in the infirmary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mochizuki-senpai, did something happen… between you and Amamiya-senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama's face became sullen, and she lowered her head. I gasped and corrected myself hurriedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-It's fine! If you don't feel like telling me! Y-Y-You don't need to!</p>
<p class="null-p">We are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not friends, just 【Acquaintances】.</p>
<p class="null-p">We fell into silence again, and the one who spoke first was Rika-sama as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san… Regist-san, you don't have dealings with my parents, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her question felt like an interrogation, as if I was standing at a trial.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Y-Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was asked this question last time too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that case..."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if she had made up her mind after a long deliberation, Rika-sama said:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san… Can you let me see your face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I started wavering. I wavered so much that I was blubbering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-This is my hobby! A-And you see, isn't Mochizuki-senpai afraid of strangers, and only because you can't see my face--"</p>
<p class="null-p">That you could chat with me. Wasn't that, right? So I won't take it off. She should be able to accept that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, and so, can I see your face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">My calculations fell short. The reasons why I wear the mask-- was refuted by her, and I wavered because I had just been thinking about myself. That was why I missed Rika-sama's look of desperation. "Erm, that's…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, please tell me your name, Regist-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">No, don't wanna.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such an emotion arose within me. As for why, it's because I couldn't be like my avatar. Rika-sama was only safe thanks to Nakajima. Rikasama was freed from her bonds because of Amamiya. Nakajima said my actions was the courage of the weak, and I think that was a very adequate description. I didn't want her to know who I was because I was weak. That's why,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I could only say that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't do it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please answer properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't want you to see my face."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was so against this exactly because it was Mochizuki Rika. Her eyes turned stubborn. I had saw this look of hers as Tosa Itsuki several times this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Regist-san, I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">I had an inkling on what she would say and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please leave."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Good bye."</p>
<p class="null-p">I lowered my head and exited the 【One Person Club】 with the bag</p>
<p class="null-p">still on. I didn't take it off even after reaching the stairwell. I then remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I forgot to take the booklet..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving that thing behind would only trouble Rika-sama.</p>
<p class="null-p">Haha, I laughed out of loneliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">The school was unusually quiet with the class in session. Even though I was walking around with a bag on my head, no one saw or questioned me. I then returned to the Second Courtyard where I met Rika-sama without encountering a single soul.</p>
<p class="null-p">I finally felt like taking the bag off and liberating my face. This bag with three holes in it… Should I return this? But that would just irritate Rika-sama if I did… I didn't even thought of the option of throwing it away. So I folded it and held it in my hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya, Nakajima and Kiritani's gang were gone. The courtyard was the same, as if nothing happened here at all. I stopped and surveyed the area… Pandora wasn't here? Where did she go?</p>
<p class="null-p">-- I should be able to find her if I collect my phone back. Pandora was inside the game installed in the phone, so she should answer if I asked her in game.</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked to the shrub where I was hiding, and found something familiar on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a tail plushy with a strap attached to it. It dropped at the place where Rika-sama was restrained just now. She was clutching it tightly like an amulet, but she probably dropped it accidentally in the struggle.</p>
<p class="null-p">I picked it up and brought it to my nose. A scent came from it, the fragrance of its owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you… supposed to be an amulet? Why aren't you by your owner's side?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving the bag aside, I have to return this to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was thinking that, I sighed deeply. Yesterday, I still couldn't believe that I was eating lunch in the 【One Person Club】. I was going to bring my menu for Thursday, Apricot Jam Bread, Croquette Sandwich and Cheese & Ham Simple Sandwich for lunch there today - It was strange after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">The me in reality hesitate to even think that far.</p>
<p class="null-p">Would the me in the game go for it…? I have to play on.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at the place where the tail plushy fell on the ground. I fell into a dilemma for a few seconds as I deliberated between going back there or putting it down and leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……"</p>
<p class="null-p">I dusted away its dirt and grass, and put it into my pocket. I continued walking towards the shrub, and found Pandora whom I thought wouldn't be there. Inside the shrub where Nakajima hid earlier, Pandora was sitting there with her arms around her knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Beside Pandora were textbooks, stationery, a coiled up earpiece and my bluetooth phone. It was exactly as I left it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora lift her head because I called out to her. She was expressionless, but she seemed distracted and lost.</p>
<p class="null-p">The phone that had turned dark in power saving mode emitted light once more. Her voice could be heard from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">【You are back.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I bent over to pick up the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora had been staying here the entire time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. I didn't know where Itsuki went… So I stayed here.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I thought you would have went off to explore the school."</p>
<p class="null-p">After her visualization, Pandora had a deep sense of curiosity. I knew that 10m was her limit, or rather, I knew that was her limit and expected her to go to the very edge. During those times, the one who had to remind her to be careful was me. I was like a nagging mother back then. Without a guardian, Pandora should have the time to enjoy her freedom.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I won't do such a thing.】</p>
<p class="null-p">She sounded angry. I looked towards her because I felt her gaze. It was just a little, but her eyes seemed to have a spark of anger.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that dissipated in no time.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Or rather, I was thinking about something.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Thinking?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. I was wondering why I felt uneasy.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt that Pandora was a high quality AI. But even so, uneasiness?</p>
<p class="null-p">【As the optimistic type, I do have the setting of feeling unease, but that's seldom used. That should be the case, but I couldn't wave away my uneasiness until just now.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… my fault for ignoring your warning."</p>
<p class="null-p">She told me that it would be better to not do anything, but I ignored her advice. In the end, I was beaten up… Ahh… No good. The more I thought about it, the more I would get caught in the cycle of negativity. 【No. Itsuki is the one who will decide your own actions. No matter what happens, I will always support Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I see, she was my companion after all… I tried asking:</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Even if it is a disastrous failure?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. Even if it is a disastrous failure.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora's expression warmed slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I found the reason for my uneasiness. The problem lies with Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it's my fault after all…"</p>
<p class="null-p">【I'm Itsuki's support AI. That's why I will feel uneasy when I'm separated from Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">That was unintentional, but now that I think about it, I did something akin to throwing Pandora to the side and leaving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Please take your phone with you even if it is an emergency. I will be anxious if I couldn't get ahold of Itsuki's situation.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll do just that."</p>
<p class="null-p">【- You seem down, Itsuki】</p>
<p class="null-p">I sat down beside Pandora with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Class is still in session. Do you want to return to the classroom?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. I decided to skip this period… Instead of that, I'm wondering just what is this prediction system."</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned on the silent mode on my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stopped the game after my avatar went into dynasty warrior mode. Let's continue the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima didn't make her appearance here, but Amamiya came out just as expected. However, the conversation between Rika-sama and Amamiya didn't happen, although it happened in reality--【--Rika.</p>
<p class="null-p">That guy is just the same as me anyway.】 These words didn't appear. My avatar was like a hero in the game, so Rika-sama's psyche was more stable than in reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sequence was similar, but the key points were drastically different. Rika-sama and my avatar went to the 【One Person Club】. As my avatar was wearing a Recycling bag in the game, he didn't receive a paper bag like I did.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tapped the screen repeatedly and read on.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Regist-san… Can you let me see your face?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, Rika-sama questioned my avatar-- the me in the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">【…Eh?】</p>
<p class="null-p">The me in the game wavered.</p>
<p class="null-p">【T-This is my hobby! A-And you see, isn't Mochizuki-senpai afraid of strangers, and only because you can't see my face--"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. That should be it. I sighed in relief, this should be enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">【It's fine, and so, can I see your face?】</p>
<p class="null-p">I held my breath and steadied myself. The options 【Take it off】 and</p>
<p class="null-p">【Don't take it off】 appeared. I already chose in reality, it should be 【Don't take it off】 here. Since this was a review, the option would be selected automatically like before.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- But I was wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I understand.】</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar said.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…"</p>
<p class="null-p">What was that. Weren't you actually me?</p>
<p class="null-p">The narration text appeared. 【Tosa Itsuki removed the Recycling bag from his head.】.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Rika-sama on screen opened her eyes wide and stared at the me in the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I am Tosa Itsuki from class 2-2.】 I gave my class and name.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Regist-san… Tosa Itsuki-kun】</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, a smile that I had never seen in the game or in reality before made her pretty face even more beautiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that instant--【Heroine A? Mochizuki Rika】 became 【Heroine A Mochizuki Rika】. "Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The heroine got confirmed?</p>
<p class="null-p">-- That can't be.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I acted differently from the game in the past, it would amend itself according to reality correct?</p>
<p class="null-p">The screen suddenly blacked out.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Error Code 999999999999000】</p>
<p class="null-p">I finally stopped staring at the screen and raised my head. And looked towards Pandora.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What… is this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【The application encountered a critical error. This is the second time this application have encountered an error. The accuracy of the prediction from now on would fall below the acceptable level. Auto repair had been attempted, but failed to revert the application to the acceptable level. Would you like to report the details of the second error?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Double errors are very rare. This is most likely the result of the Itsuki in the prediction system and the Itsuki in reality taking different actions.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did such a thing just have to happen to me? Even though it was just the fourth day? The rest of today and tomorrow wouldn't have any predictions?</p>
<p class="null-p">【Please report the double error. If you do that…】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… If I do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki's prediction system can be restarted on the main server, and it might be possible to perform partial predictions.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it might be available for the fifth day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That felt more sarcastic than I imagined.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki…】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Report it then."</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't think it would be of any use. But since I gave a positive reply</p>
<p class="null-p">to Pandora, I tapped on 'Yes' on the report error dialogue box.</p>
<p class="null-p">【The report has been submitted. Please wait. Error Code 999999999999000 had occurred. Game resume time is undetermined.】</p>
<p class="null-p">-- The one thing I was certain about was that I lost a cheat like ability.</p>
<p class="null-p">I lost the power of the 【There are no heroines in my youth】 game that would tell me what to do in the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">I laid onto my desk and toyed with the croquette bun in the bag. The bread I bought at the snack shop on Thursday were Apricot Jam Bread, Croquette Sandwich and Cheese & Ham Simple Sandwich. But they were all sold out so I could only buy a croquette bun… It wasn't the first time I experienced that though.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki】</p>
<p class="null-p">A voice on the lowest volume came from the phone I placed on my desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">I already set it to off, but Pandora had the power to switch the volume on or off now. I wasn't wearing my earpiece. Pandora seemed to be aggravating me intentionally, the people around us would hear if I ignored her. Even though she was an AI that would only speak out loud at the appropriate times-- No, she spoke after considering the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only I could see the silver haired girl standing in front of me with both hands on my desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">【What are you doing? Lunch break is almost over.】 I hope lunch break would finish sooner, Pandora.</p>
<p class="null-p">I returned to the classroom after the period ended, and told the people around me that I spent the third period in the toilet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Have you taken any medicine?</p>
<p class="null-p">Kazuya was concerned.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now, I was being lectured by Pandora during lunch break.</p>
<p class="null-p">I picked up my phone. I launched the 【There are no heroines in my youth】app that only displayed 【Game resume time undetermined】, and turned on the sound setting screen. These functions were still usable. I turned Pandora's voice setting to off.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was changed back immediately. Like a fight between grade schoolers, the fight between on and off kept repeating.</p>
<p class="null-p">【This is the 20th time, do you want to continue?】</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't the lowest volume anymore, Pandora had turned up the volume. I looked around me. The classroom was noisy during lunch, and no one was paying attention to me… It didn't matter anymore, I put down the phone in self abandonment and toyed with the croquette bun once more. I wasn't wasting food. I would eat it later. I just wasn't hungry, and was using it to pass the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora. Let's play word chain[1], I will start. Boring (Taikutsu), so your turn starts with 'Tsu' "</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki……】</p>
<p class="null-p">She said impatiently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Start with 'Tsu'."</p>
<p class="null-p">【…Tutankhamun[2]. Itsuki win. Since Itsuki won, you should do the things you should do.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, why so fast, don't be so obvious even if you are throwing the game..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Also,</p>
<p class="null-p">"And regarding the things I should do, didn't Pandora say you will support me no matter what course of actions I would take?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【I did say that. That's why I would support the actions Itsuki truly wants to take, and guide you along.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I already did the things I want to do. That's why I'm back in my seat."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Let me ask you then, why did you put the paper bag with holes and the tail plushy you picked up under your desk? You brought them to the snack shop and then returned with them. You then took them out and checked them twice.】 "……"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was poked right where it hurts and fell silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">【-- Is it really fine to not visit the rooftop?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I go or not? Even I wasn't sure of the answer and felt troubled.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stopped halfway up the stairs. Pandora who was walking in front of me turned me as if she was urging me on. I held my phone and the Recycling bag in my right hand, and the paper bag from the 【One Person Club】 and the tail plushy in my left. I stood on the flight of stairs before the end of the stairwell leading to the rooftop, and peeked at the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was something placed below the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked over slowly and picked it up. It was the 1cm thick booklet printed with Nakajima Konoha name and detailed her election policies. It was used by me as a shield for my face, so the bottom part was bent at the center.</p>
<p class="null-p">I transferred all my items to my left hand and tried the handle. It was locked.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I will take a look.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora phased through the door and disappeared to the other end. She returned faster than I imagined and pointed at the phone. Did that mean the sound was off and I should check the phone? Text appeared on the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【She is right there. With her back to the door.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama was right behind this door. She was waiting… No, if that was so, she wouldn't have placed the booklet here. So she didn't want me to come, and was guarding the place?</p>
<p class="null-p">I knocked on the door. There wasn't any reaction. But I believe Pandora and spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, it's me."</p>
<p class="null-p">I hesitated before adding on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…… Regist. "</p>
<p class="null-p">The silence was heavy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm… About what happened before lunch break,"</p>
<p class="null-p">I stopped right here.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sorry about earlier.</p>
<p class="null-p">But what was I apologizing for? And why? Even now, I still didn't want to show her my face and tell her my name, so should I apologize? Should I apologize for wearing a Recycling bag whenever I meet with senpai?</p>
<p class="null-p">"After that, I went to the courtyard to retrieve my things… And I picked up a tail plushy and brought it here. I will leave this right here, together with the paper bag you gave me."</p>
<p class="null-p">I placed the tail plushy into the bag and hung it on the door handle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had fun for the three days I became your 【acquiantance】."</p>
<p class="null-p">These were all things that was impossible-- And it finally came to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I removed the paper bag back then, it would developed just like the game and I could confirm my heroine. But I took a decisively different action. It was over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't be coming back, so don't worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt that I had finished everything I wanted to say, but I didn't feel like leaving right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lunch break wasn't over yet… It should be fine to stay a while longer, but this is the last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I leaned on the door from the stairwell side and sat down. Pandora looked at me worryingly, and leaned on the wall on one side. After her visualization, even though her voice wasn't in sync with her expression, I could tell there was some subtle changes despite her stony face. -- But this would last for just a few more hours.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora looked like she wanted to say something, so I checked my phone. There wasn't any message from Pandora. Moments later, the phone vibrated. It was a 【Smile】 message.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Who was it…? It's probably Kazuya. Not just topics about his girlfriend Nami-chan, he will send messages like 【A black cat passed in front of me just now】, in direct contrast with Gon-chan who didn't send many 【Smile】 messages.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a message from Kaname. Having met him in person, the content really matched his style. He seemed to have read Nakajima's policies and wrote his thoughts about it. I should compliment him casually.</p>
<p class="null-p">【You should read it too, Tosa-kun.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【I have it with me right now, will give it a read.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I replied quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">I picked up the booklet on the cold floor… It helped me a lot just now. But just as my physical shield, so its content didn't matter then. I even suspected that Nakajima was only running for student council president in order to create her reverse harem.</p>
<p class="null-p">I flipped open the cover and read it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Basically, the booklet has been designed to explain the main points in the opening three pages without the need to read the entire thing. It was structured to explain the details if one wished to do so… How unexpected. No, instead of it being unexpected, a lot of effort has been put into the policies being written. The source of the most unhappiness between students-- The venue allocations of the sports clubs, budget for small societies, menu of the snack shop, agreement made with the teachers, the dwindling number of new books in the library, and the revival of this and that. It didn't only state that she intend to do this, she even listed the detailed steps on how to carry them out.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, since Nakajima was a beauty, there would be people voting for her based on looks alone. This was something common in sales. Even though it was a misunderstanding of what happened in the teacher's office, I decided to vote for her because Nakajima was kind to me and pleasing to the eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if it was now-- I wanted to vote for her because of the policies she was championing. I closed the booklet with that thought in mind. I didn't realize it, but Pandora was also reading these policies.</p>
<p class="null-p">【How thoughtful. She really put a lot of effort for the sake of the school.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I agreed with the text on my phone and stroked my chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought I wouldn't vote for her after learning Nakajima's true character. However, this was a different matter. Nakajima's passion towards the student council presidency was sincere.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although I wouldn't have the chance to meet Nakajima again.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at the time displayed on the phone, and the bell signifying the end of lunch break would ring soon. Before that, I dusted off my pants and stood up. If I stay here, I would run into Rika-sama exiting the 【One Person Club】, which would be awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just once, I turned and looked at the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should say something. What should I say…? What did I need to say? My thoughts became like this because I had been relying too much on the preview for the past three days.</p>
<p class="null-p">I smiled awkwardly. Rika-sama should be long gone and in the 【One Person Club】 by now. If I asked Pandora to look, I would know where Rika was.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I wanted that to remain unclear.</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't matter if Rika-sama was behind the door or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter what the answer was, I didn't want to know.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the fourth day, 29th September-- Thursday, I had campus beautification duties after school. Which was to clean up my assigned area. The indoors group brought brooms, dustpans and rags. The outdoor group had U-shaped metal tongs to pick up rubbish, and 50litre transparent trash bags.</p>
<p class="null-p">The male student who was the head of the campus beautification committee as well as the student election committee head, was very stringent against slacking. We even have to report to him when we finished cleaning our assigned areas.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just for today, I was glad about the cleaning activity. In terms of focusing on work and not thinking about anything else, this worked great.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter which committee it was, we would be separated into groups of twos. The other beautification committee member from class 2-2 was a girl from the ballet club, and as she had a performance coming up and needed to prepare, I had to clean up alone. And so, it would take more time than usual. Because the beautification committee head was in the election committee office, I had to go there in order to report. The sky outside the window had already darkened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, it will end faster with the two of us, but I would usually hit her with "E-E-Ermmm!"repeatedly as I tried to speak to her carefully. With regards to this point, having Pandora as a conversational partner was a good thing. The only downside was her lack of a physical body, so she couldn't perform manual labour.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pardon my intrusion."</p>
<p class="null-p">I let Pandora wait outside the corridor, and opened the door to the main office. A ponytailed female student near the entrance immediately lowered her head. From her ribbon colour, she was a first year. Her facial features were well proportioned and she had brown eyes. With her delicate features, she might be a famous person among the first years. If I was playing 【There are no heroines in my youth】, this might become an encounter with a potential heroine, I thought mindlessly. I should stop being influenced by that game…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm looking for the committee head."</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked around the room -- and found him. The bespectacled student who looked like a good guy was the committee head. He had the face of a buddha, but the heart of a devil. All the campus beautification committee members had experienced that. The committee head was speaking with someone with a troubled expression. Going by this development, I needed to wait here? Who was the person troubling the committee head? I shifted my position to catch a glimpse of her face. I felt surprised for a moment and quickly understood. This was the election committee office. It wouldn't be strange if they needed to contact the student council president candidate Nakajima.</p>
<p class="null-p">I then remembered that Nakajima didn't even commit my name and face to her memory, so it was fine to meet her here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Are you serious about this, Nakajima-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The committee head asked in an anxious voice. Was there an argument?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm serious, and it's actually…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima in sheep skin mode said vaguely and quiet down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Did something happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is something I'm concerned about. I'm still in the midst of considering it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is possible to forfeit the election. If you forfeit, it will become a vote of confidence for Kiritani, and he will be elected the student council president. It is basically impossible to lose in a confidence voting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"From your silence, you are still thinking about it, right? Then go home for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima walked passed me with footsteps that lacked her usual authority. Nakajima looked my way, but her expression didn't change as she left the room. The committee head called for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're reporting your completion of cleaning duties, right? Year, class and full name please."</p>
<p class="null-p">He took out a logbook and pen from the desk. The report would be done after he records the details.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, Tosa Itsuki from class 2-2."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Is the kanji of your name 'tree'[3]?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's written as Month One, read as Itsuki"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected, the new logbook has a mistake…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Month One-- January?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The muttering of the Committee head with a sigh overlapped with someone else's comment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is true if Itsuki is translated to english. What about it, Tagawa?</p>
<p class="null-p">I followed the gaze of the committee head and looked at the girl with</p>
<p class="null-p">a ponytail standing at the entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't mind, it's just a personal matter."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl replied with a calm and collected voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your report has been acknowledged. You may leave now, Tosa."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I will take my leave now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora was waiting when I exited the office. I was all set to return home--.</p>
<p class="null-p">I sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora"</p>
<p class="null-p">【What's the matter?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nakajima walked out just now, right? Which way did she go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I ran in the direction Pandora pointed. She seemed to be going to back to her 2-1 classroom, but she wasn't there. She couldn't be too far--. In that case, the third level? I found Nakajima holding the stair railing at the stairwell to the third floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Nakajima!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After calling her name, she finally shift her focus towards me. The next moment, she looked my way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm, you are…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Generic face. "</p>
<p class="null-p">I said that term myself, and Nakajima's face showed she understood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Ah, generic face Watanabe right. What is it? Don't get too cosy</p>
<p class="null-p">with me now. You aren't my friend after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was in the election committee's office just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The thing about forfeiting the student council election…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You heard that huh. I haven't decided yet. I'm still thinking about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since you are considering about it, that means you have thought about forfeiting seriously. Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima's gaze started wavering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…… It has nothing to do with you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It has nothing to do with me, I'm just a generic face, so it's fine even if you tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's true…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima stated her reason with a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made an appointment to meet with Amamiya-san in the infirmary during lunch and confessed to him. I also explained to him about the reverse harem properly. Amamiya-san said he doesn't mind. But… If we're going to date, and I became the student council president, wouldn't we have no time to meet? Amamiya-san says he hates that. It's true that I had the election in the bag, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She puffed out her chest, but her brows were still furrowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that's why I'm troubled."</p>
<p class="null-p">As if she was putting on a strong front, Nakajima continued speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… He's right. Being the student council president is just a stepping stone for a recommendation to university and creating the reverse harem, it's not that important…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- After your confession, Amamiya told you that he wouldn't date you unless you forfeit the student council election. If you insist on becoming the student council president, Amamiya might not date you.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why you're forfeiting, is that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amamiya-san wasn't that forthright, I sensed this on my own."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the difference… You retard "</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing that, I couldn't help raging.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hah? You should call me a responsible girl instead! My actions are praiseworthy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're being responsible in the wrong way! Just form a reverse harem if you want to! Make a bunch of hotties fall head over heels for you! But using common sense, it's obvious that a guy that makes you decadent is not even worth considering. It's the same even if the positions of the boy and girl are switched!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's that about being decadent…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Although you claimed you're only doing this for the college reccomendation and reverse harem, I read the election policies you gave me this morning, Nakajima… I think you really have the best interest of the school at heart. Even though there're some impurities mixed in, your core is still the same -- Is someone who is tempting you to throw all that away in exchange for dating you a hottie on the inside like Nakajima said? Isn't he getting you to forfeit in a roundabout way instead of going about it openly? If that is so, then I really don't understand you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… What's wrong with doing something for love!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I snorted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are forfeiting for the sake of love? The way I see it, you're just a worthless woman with just your looks going for you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What…! You are just a generic face..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm just a generic face! My name is Yamada Taro. It's fine for you to not remember them forever! Good bye!"</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying those lines on a whim, I turned my back to Nakajima and left. I started feeling flustered and stormed off quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki…】</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing the voice of Pandora who was following me, my head started cooling down. I descended the stairs at normal speed and headed into class 2-2. No one was around, which was only natural. The lights were off too and it was dark. I walked to my seat in the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">I placed my phone onto the desk and sat down. I then laid down onto my table.</p>
<p class="null-p">My heart was a mess right now. What did I say to Nakajima just now? I did say what came to my mind. But when Amamiya's name came up, I couldn't handle it well and I let my feelings of resignation got in the way. I was just venting my frustration out at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"On the 5th day, everything resetted to zero..."</p>
<p class="null-p">She propped herself up from my desk and put her hand on top of my hair, as if she was patting my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I moved, the hand that looked real went into my forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I passed right through.】</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the first time Pandora tried touching me on her own initiative… From Pandora? As for me, I didn't try touching her either. Why didn't I try touching her? Because the visualization was too realistic, so I found it hard to touch her.</p>
<p class="null-p">【It will be great if I have a real body.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The figure of the silver haired girl saying this disappeared before my eyes. I turned anxious for an instant and grabbed the phone on my desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">But after looking at the time, I understood immediately. 24 hours had passed since the visualization function was unlocked yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- It was time.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was all, but I felt a sense of unease.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora?"</p>
<p class="null-p">An immediate reply came from the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Here.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I sighed in relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… It's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 6. The Friday Without Preview</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get up! Get up get up get up! Itsuki! You will be late if you sleep any longer!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not feeling well today, I will be calling in sick."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Liar, I can tell from your voice."</p>
<p class="null-p">The fifth day, Friday. It was the 30th of September. This was the day where the forced reparation would fall onto me if I don't confirm someone as my heroine.</p>
<p class="null-p">I lost to my grandfather who pulled away my blanket and got up slowly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The role of your guardianship had been entrusted to me. I can accept it if you want to miss a class. But if you want to do that, convince me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing grandfather standing there like a Nioh[1], I averted my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I need some time to sort out my emotions..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sort out your emotions?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To brace myself for the fact that I will become Doutei Doutei…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Virgin Virgin"? What the… so that's what's bothering you? You got dumped by a girl, huh... Itsuki is already at that age... It's fine! I only got laid when I was 20! As for girls you still have your junior Breakchan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is a guy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, it's better for you to attend school today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's your basis for that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My 73 years of life experience."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying that, Grandpa left my room and I could hear him walking down the stairs. From my 16 years of life experience, I could tell that Grandpa won't back down once he brings up his 73 years of life experience…</p>
<p class="null-p">I had no choice but to attend school. My plan to sleep the entire day away was shattered before I even put it into action. Scratching my messy bed hair, I picked up the phone beside my pillow.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Good morning.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Morning Pandora."</p>
<p class="null-p">I then checked the app.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Error Code 999999999999000 had occurred. Game resume time is undetermined.】</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I will notify you immediately if it shows any signs of getting better.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">I changed into my uniform, groomed myself, and went to the living room. Breakfast was already set on the table. It was Grandpa's turn to cook today. After saying "Bon appétit" I started eating. Rice with miso soup, egg, natto and pickled radish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa's side of the table had two empty bottles of energy drink. He was still playing 【Hell Scream 4】 with a bandana over his head. Speaking of which, he had been like this ever since the game launched. Pulling all nighters without sleep. It was a venomous lifestyle for the elderly, but Grandpa was a properly behaved old man outside the launch of new games. He would sleep and wake early, and even go for a walk in the morning. It could be said that playing games through the night was stimulating to his brain and fingers, so it wasn't a bad way to stimulate his mind. Grandpa didn't have much problem with illness. Normally, I would join in with the games, and I only stop myself from doing so because I installed 【There are no heroines in my youth】 onto my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tremble in fear, Itsuki. Your grandpa is in sight of clearing 【Hell Scream 4】 today. What about you, Itsuki? You are engrossed in a mobile game these few days, right? Have you cleared it yet?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa's eyes were shining as he sipped on miso soup.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I probably can't clear it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then use cash items then! Your grandpa permits it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a game without cash items."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's a really honest mobile game then. They are not taking down the game, right? Don't give up."</p>
<p class="null-p">I shook my head and chewed on the radish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuki… are you giving up? I had told you this many times. As a gamer, you have to respect the creator. No matter how much time it takes, you have to clear the game, I told you that right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing his miso soup, Grandpa slammed his bowl onto the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Clearing the game aside, I'm on the verge of being forced to end it… Thank you for the meal."</p>
<p class="null-p">I placed my cutleries into the kitchen sink.</p>
<p class="null-p">I told Grandpa "I'm leaving now", as I put on my canvas backpack</p>
<p class="null-p">and left the house weakly. I had a strange feeling about this. My mind was always filled with the scenes of the preview for the past two days. Those were gone now.</p>
<p class="null-p">I arrived at the school entrance, and the election candidates were still there even though I was almost late, probably because this was the day of the election. They were giving their final rally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good Morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima was greeting the people around her in sheep skin mode. Since she was going along with the election activities, that means she didn't forfeit right…? When I looked at her, I seemed to have locked gaze with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Maybe there was a hottie behind me. I turned back but there wasn't anyone like that anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned back to the front again. Nakajima took one step my way. Even though I was just being self-conscious, I still averted my eyes away from Nakajima and walked quickly past the gate.</p>
<p class="null-p">I put my shoes into the shoe rack, and the school public announcement rang. Was it regarding the election? That guess was refuted immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, I would hear a familiar voice. The teachers were the ones in charge of such broadcasts. However, it wasn't any of the usual teachers. I heard a familiar voice said: 【-- I am Mochizuki Rika from class 3-1.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I held my breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Can I have a little of your time in the morning in the broadcast room-- Regist-san?】</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned stiff with my hands reaching for my indoor shoes.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I will be waiting for your arrival at the usual time, at the usual place.</p>
<p class="null-p">So please come… as Regist-san.】</p>
<p class="null-p">That was all. The sound signalling the end of the broadcast was played.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What was that thing about Regist-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard some female students discussing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mochizuki Rika, it's that Mochizuki, Rika right? Isn't her character settings wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that is a message for a specific person, right? Just send a</p>
<p class="null-p">【Smile】 message then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… She probably didn't know the ID and phone number or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that even possible? She just said to meet at the usual time and place, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I retracted my hand reaching for the indoor shoes, and dug out my phone from my pocket. Pandora didn't say anything, so nothing should happen. I already knew that, but I still couldn't help feeling disappointed by the unchanging system message.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Error Code 999999999999000 had occurred. Game resume time is undetermined.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The usual time, at the usual place. As Regist-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">I just need to visit the 【One Person Club】 at the rooftop while wearing a Recycling bag.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what Rika-sama meant.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- I couldn't fathom why she would call for me even if she had to use the school public announcement system. With Rika-sama's personality, she must be really nervous about using the school's broadcast system.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was free to ignore her. However, I couldn't ignore this without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, I suppressed my feeling of wanting to run away, and at 【the usual time】 that Rika-sama mentioned, I headed for the rooftop with my phone and Recycling bag. I was too nervous to even visit the snack shop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, I took thrice as much time to reach the top of the stairwell leading to the rooftop… Because I was walking so slowly. I even put on the Recycling bag slowly.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knocked on the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before I announced that I was Regist, the door opened immediately. I didn't even check to see if the door was locked. From the looks of things, the door was unlocked right at the very beginning.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who opened the door was Rika-sama.</p>
<p class="null-p">The corner of her eyes were red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm… Thank you for coming. I'm sorry for calling for you in such a way… I don't know anything about Regist-san at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-It's fine… Erm, do you have something for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama nodded affirmatively and looked straight at me. Her gaze was so direct it felt intimidating. If I wasn't wearing a Recycling bag, I probably would have averted my gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so sly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true, Senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was the sly one. But Rika-sama shook her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Even though I didn't want to say everything myself, I still insisted Regist-san to show me your face. I even thought that it is only natural for you to accept this request. Because I want to be sure that Registsan isn't related… not someone I knew."</p>
<p class="null-p">I furrowed my brows. Want to be sure that I wasn't someone she knew? So anyone she knew would be out? No, before that, there was also the matter of being related to her in some manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-san, I hope you will listen to my story, please come with me to the 【One Person Club】. But I have a request-- Before I finish my story, please also tell me about Regist-san. Let me see your face and know your name too."</p>
<p class="null-p">I unconsciously touched the handle part of the Recycling bag around my neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could feel my body temperature rising. I hated that and felt like running away. Didn't I already failed? Before coming here, I spent an entire minute checking to see if 【Error Code 999999999999000】 was gone. Pandora said 【I already told Itsuki plenty of times that I will notify you about that immediately. Itsuki also understood. But even so, you still insist on seeing it for yourself, I guess this is human nature.】. After that, Pandora let me check as much as I wished.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- All of a sudden, Nakajima's motto came up in my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Honesty and sincerely.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama showed me her sincerity as much as possible. If I turned back here, wouldn't that be trampling over her sincerity?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. After senpai finishes what you want to say, I will take off the Recycling bag."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Regist-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama, smiled. But it still looked a little stiff.</p>
<p class="null-p">What she wanted to tell me was difficult for Rika-sama to say-Maybe it was about her bitter past.</p>
<p class="null-p">I walked into the 【One Person Club】 and sat on a chair. Rika-sama brewed green tea, and the cup was still steaming. After sipping on the tea, Rika-sama started recounting her past.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the past… I wasn't so wary of strangers, Regist-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, there was a reason behind this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"During the latter years of grade school, I had a lot of friends. But… That was just one sided from me, and wasn't the truth."</p>
<p class="null-p">The hands she placed on her knees were trembling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The people I thought were my friends were actually children asked by my parents to be 【Rika's friend】. They got them to be my friends by using money and gifts… No, they bribed them to be my friends. I learned about this from a certain boy. He said 【actually, everyone dislikes you】. I didn't have such things as friends. I could still remember that feeling of emptiness."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama looked to the distance with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My parents did this for my sake. However… I started fearing the term friend. It was the same with interacting with people, I always wonder whether those who talked to me cheerfully were actually lying. I cried and asked my parents not to do such a thing. I even vented at onii-sama, saying 【Why does onii-sama have so many true friends.】" That was the first time onii-sama showed that sort of troubled expression, Rika-sama muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- I was homeschooled in middle school. Actually… I didn't really want to come to high school. I kept wondering if my parents would bribe 【friends】 for my sake."</p>
<p class="null-p">I remembered what Rika-sama said when we spoke in this shed for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">【We are not friends, right?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama only accepted because I said I wanted to be acquaintances.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But onii-sama promised me that he wouldn't allow dear father and dear mother to do such things in high school -- That wasn't a lie. Dear father and dear mother didn't interfere directly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Interfere directly?</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I debuted in high school, I followed what onii-sama said… back then, my relationship with my schoolmate Amamiya-kun. Registsan already met him. Yesterday, the last male student who appeared in the courtyard was Amamiya-kun.… Amamiya Keisuke-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama said Amamiya's name as if she felt nostalgic about something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My true nature was exposed to Amamiya-kun. But he didn't tease or made fun of me. That Amamiya-kun back then… I liked him a lot, and</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt very blissed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And so, the two of you dated?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it was just me thinking so one-sidedly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Was that so? But from the way Amamiya was pestering Rika-sama, I thought their position was reversed.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I was in my first year… How was Rika-sama like? I only knew her name back then. A senpai in the second year was in a completely different league to a fresh meat in his first year. Even more so for the famous Rika-sama. After making friends and getting used to my high school life together with Grandpa, rumours about Rika-sama finally reached my ears. I learned nefarious rumours about Rika-sama.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- After getting to know Amamiya-kun, I also made several other female 【friends】. We would chat together and the girls would visit the washroom together with me. I didn't need to follow onii-sama's three principles when I was with them. But…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama clenched her fists on her knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But all these were lies. My new 【friends】 were just girls who likes Amamiya-kun, and were asked by him to be my 【friends】. The truth was, they hated me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wasn't Amamiya-senpai just being considerate for Mochizukisenpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I wasn't trying to defend Amamiya. I was just hoping that he was doing this for Rika-sama's sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Rika-sama just shook her head with a dry laugh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The business that Amamiya's father is running, is the trading partner of the Mochizuki Organization."</p>
<p class="null-p">She smiled, but looked as if she was about to cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Both dear father and dear mother didn't threaten Amamiya-kun and asked him to befriend me. They didn't need to do so. I think that is the truth. Amamiya-kun only became friends with me proactively because his family convinced him that it would bring convenience to his family's business. From that perspective, both dear father and dear mother didn't interfere directly-- Then, Amamiya-kun just needed to approached me who had been isolated. Yes, that was all. He didn't bully or hurt me. He was gentle and made me feel comfortable, and help me made 【friends】… which made me feel blissed… It's simple, right? Amamiya-kun was just doing something good and kind."</p>
<p class="null-p">A good thing? Wasn't this the opposite?</p>
<p class="null-p">"However, was I actually blessed? With Amamiya-kun around, with my 【friends】 around… even if my 【friends】 detested me, they wouldn't show at all. I didn't notice anything… If she didn't tell me the truth, I might have stayed that way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did someone tell senpai the truth?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"One of my 【friends】."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I then told Amamiya-kun and the others that they didn't need to force themselves to do something they didn't like. That night, I protested to my parents. Why did it felt more painful than the previous time? I still remember my parent's troubled looks now. Onii-sama was furious at dear father and dear mother too, and I started crying in the midst of my protest-- And then, spring break came, and I started locking myself in my room again. I didn't want to go to high school anymore. At this moment, onii-sama lectured me harshly."</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked very calm when she talked about being lectured.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He scolded me for my sake. He was angry. From the very beginning, onii-sama was the only one who would become angry at me. I finally attended high school, and I reverted back to my old self because of I was conscious of others. He lectured me about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">She hated becoming like this, so Rika-sama continued attending high school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"On the opening ceremony of the second year, I learned that Amamiya-kun went to study abroad. Several of my 【friends】 also transferred school… My parents didn't do anything, because they promised."</p>
<p class="null-p">So this was the how the rumour about Rika-sama making female students transfer with her glare started. They probably found it hard to stay in school because they felt guilty. Rika-sama probably founded the 【One Person Club】 because of that incident with Amamiya.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I was glad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama muttered softly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amamiya went to study abroad, and my 【friends】 transferred and left."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But-- Amamiya-senpai..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Was back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Amamiya-kun probably wants to apologize to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">When I saw Rika-sama and Amamiya meet for the second time, Amamiya did say something about giving him a chance to explain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My parents also told me that staying mad at him wouldn't do, and to listen to his explanation when Amamiya-kun returns to Japan-- I hated that, that's why I was crying at the rooftop on that day I first met Regist-san. The matter of Amamiya-kun returning, talking with him and--"</p>
<p class="null-p">There's more?</p>
<p class="null-p">She stopped unnaturally.</p>
<p class="null-p">The silent Rika-sama, smiled as if she remembered something funny.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard a cry for help, 【Save me ahhhhh!】"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wanted to cry by myself until my tears run dry, but when I heard 【Save me ahhhhh!】, my urge to cry was blown away."</p>
<p class="null-p">My face blushed red… How shameful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- I want to know how Regist-san looks like, and your name. I want to be sure you're not related to my parents."</p>
<p class="null-p">-- That guy is the same as me anyway.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were the words Amamiya said that made Rika-sama waver.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mochizuki-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">I straightened my back on my chair.</p>
<p class="null-p">…It was a tad late.</p>
<p class="null-p">I undid the knot around my neck, and took off the Recycling bag covering my face. I tidied my ruffled hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm… Yesterday, I didn't want to take it off because of some childish reason. It's my fault for being narrow minded and prideful… I'm Tosa Itsuki from class 2-2! Pleased to meet you, senpai!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I reached out my hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama stood up and muttered to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">……As expected?</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was baffled by that, Rika-sama took something from her skirt pocket. It was that thing I placed in the paper bag and hung on the door yesterday. That tail plushy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Regist-sama is the male student who spoke to me three days ago in the courtyard, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, haha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You picked this up for me twice."</p>
<p class="null-p">My hand that was hanging in the air was grabbed by Rika-sama with both of her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Mochizuki Rika, pleased to meet you, Tosa Itsuki-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"--Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama had a smile without a shred of bitterness.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Bzz, the phone in my shirt pocket vibrated, spoiling the mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… a new message from 【Smile】?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I think so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Could it be a notification by Pandora? Telling me that the system had been fixed?</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/himote-na-ore-ga_16.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"It might be urgent. Please don't mind me."</p>
<p class="null-p">I finally got to hold Rika-sama's hand, but I had to let it go. I accepted her goodwill with a little regretapologetically and read the message I just received. It was Kaname, and the content made my face scowl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Did something happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm, senpai, you remember the female student who helped us when you got beat up?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, that's Nakajima-san who is contesting for the seat of student council president correct? She didn't just say that she wanted to deal with the abandoned flower beds, she even prepared a solution for that, an amazing person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"After Nakajima left the classroom to meet with Amamiya… senpai, she disappeared. Even though today is election day."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima's friend didn't see her again after the 4th period's break. Her friends received a 【Smile】 from her that she would be going home early, but it would be strange for her to do so before the speech on election day.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was a second year student and in the class right next to hers. So when Kaname learned that Nakajima was missing, she wanted me to help search for her too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is Amamiya-kun involved in this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have no idea."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Amamiya tried to persuade Nakajima to forfeit the election, so I wasn't sure. His involvement in this was still a question mark. Since there wasn't any clear evidence, we couldn't accuse him about this too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Let me try talking to Amamiya-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">The bell announcing the end of lunch break rang.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There isn't much time left."</p>
<p class="null-p">The candidate's speech would be held in the sports hall during the fifth and sixth period. If Nakajima did not appear in time, it would be considered a forfeit.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was true that Amamiya would probably skip the rally and give her priority if Rika-sama called him out. We could then ask him about Nakajima. However.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Is this okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama nodded firmly, then continued with an "erm".</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can Tosa-kun come along?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even without the prediction system, I knew the correct answer to this question.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she decided to speak with Amamiya, Rika-sama took out her phone as if she had made her resolve. It was a model that was even older than Pearl white[2]. She held the phone with both hands and stared at the Home screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I used this… I should be able to contact him."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a number indicating unread messages on the 【Smile】 icon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dear mother probably told him my ID, and I had received messages from Amamiya since five days ago… But I ignored them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You read the message from the notification screen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was scary so I didn't do that either… I will try replying to him."</p>
<p class="null-p">Please come to the rooftop where the 【One Person Club】 is. I have something to discuss.</p>
<p class="null-p">After sending this, she got a reply within one minute.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Understood, I will be right there.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika walked out of the shed where the 【One Person Club】 was, and unlocked the door leading to the roof. Now we wait for Amamiya to reach here.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few minutes later, the door knob turned. A tall male student-Amamiya entered. After he stepped in, he closed the door behind him closed slowly.</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked straight at Rika-sama, and frowned when he noticed my presence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think someone other then Rika would be here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- He's my friend."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Friend, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya said softly as if he was ridiculing the idea.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama looked my way and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">She told me that she wanted me by her side during the conversation with Amamiya. However, the one who would be talking to him would be Rika-sama herself. I moved away to a distance within earshot of Rika-sama and Amamiya.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a deep breath, Rika-sama faced Amamiya and clenched her fists. However, Amamiya was the first one to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm really glad to have the chance to talk to you… First, let me say what I wanted to say. About that incident in our first year of school--</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm really sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya lowered his head. Rika-sama's shoulders quivered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Last of all, I have always lamented the fact that I didn't apologize to you. The reason I approached Rika was because of your parents. But not everything after that is a lie. I hope you can believe me this much. If possible… I wish to chat with Rika like we used to. I just want to express my apology. This has nothing to do with Rika's parents."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dear father and the others told me to forgive Amamiya-kun and make up with you. When they told me this, the feeling that I had to forgive you welled up in me. It is strange not to make up, it's my fault…</p>
<p class="null-p">And forgiving you is the right thing to do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rika…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Maybe Amamiya-kun regretted what you did to me, and felt sorry about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… Or maybe, that's a lie. Maybe you're not reflecting on it or regretting your actions at all." "No, that's--"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama shook her head at Amamiya who was refuting her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You misunderstand. It doesn't matter what Amamiya thinks anymore… I despised myself for behaving like this, and think that this is ugly. That's why I didn't want to see Amamiya-kun again."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya-kun, Rika-sama said to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No matter what anyone might say, I don't want to forgive you. I'm narrow minded, and won't forgive you even if you apologized. Amamiya-kun might be reflecting on it, but that's your problem, and have nothing to do with me. Amamiya-kun, you are hoping to be forgiven, right? To make up with me?-- That's not possible." Such a choice didn't appear in my heart even once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't have an amiable relationship with Amamiya-kun. You already lost that chance."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya himself was the one who destroyed this relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I see, I didn't fool you at it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya's mouth twisted into a shallow smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- Is dear mother and dear father pushing you this time too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was asked to make up with their stubborn daughter, Rika… They probably didn't realize their daughter had no intention to make up at all. That's just like Rika's parents, they never change."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When I was called out by Amamiya's junior Kiritani-kun yesterday at the courtyard, was he acting under your instructions?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have really grown. The old Rika would have been hooked easily. If I helped you when you're in distress, wouldn't that be a chance? Well… although two meddlesome people turned it into a strange situation."</p>
<p class="null-p">Meddlesome people-- that was probably Nakajima and me. I was beaten up but not injured because it was an act. It was a planned scene of saving the damsel from distress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Nakajima Konoha-san seemed to have gone missing. Amamiyakun is involved in this right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes I am, Amamiya replied forthrightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is the terms I agreed with Kiritani."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kiritani called Rika out and played the role of her assailant. But that wasn't done unconditionally. Amamiya needed to help Kiritani in other matters. At this moment, Nakajima confessed to Amamiya. Kiritani learned about this, and decided to use this to make Nakajima forfeit her student council president candidature. Kiritani wanted to become the student council president, but the situation was more or less set. As long as Nakajima was around, it would be hard to secure the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is worth a shot."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya pretended that he wanted to date Nakajima, and subtly coerced her to forfeit. He thought it would work. It was so effective that Nakajima went to the election committee office and asked about forfeiting the election.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought she would forfeit from the way she looks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya said with a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… You thought?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama pressed him, and Amamiya recited Nakajima's words from back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nakajima Konoha met me just now. 【I didn't need to think too deeply to realize what Amamiya-san said seemed off. Just being a student council president wouldn't take up all of my time. I will make time for my lover, so I won't withdraw.】"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was relieved by Nakajima's decision. However, what Amamiya said next blew my relief away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why she got confined… Kiritani is very pushy too. If she missed her speech, it would be seen as a forfeiture and she will be disqualified. She will be released after school when the votes had been casted. So you just need to wait-- That's what you want to know right, Rika?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Amamiya looked at Rika-sama as if he was mocking her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me where Nakajima-san is confined."</p>
<p class="null-p">"… You think I will tell you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What if I say I will tell you if Rika can forgive me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama hesitated momentarily. But she then said clearly:</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I won't agree to that demand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I agree, I don't believe that Amamiya-kun will tell me the right location where Nakajima-san is confined-- We will find</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima-san by ourselves."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, do as you wish."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Amamiya left, she pointed to the door as if she was urging me on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Tosa-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded to Rika-sama who turned her head towards me. We ran together and left the rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, about 10 minutes have passed since the fifth period began. We split up to find where Nakajima had been confined. I don't think Amamiya would leave the campus, so Nakajima must be confined in school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa-kun, let's contact each other if we find her."</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to do so, I exchanged 【Smile】ID with Rika-sama. It was a dangerous situation, but this still made me happy. I undid the vibration mode in order to hear the phone if it rings.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, we set off in opposite directions. I walked briskly as I checked the message I received from 【Smile】. Kazuya was worried that I didn't return to class by the fifth period and messaged me 【Where are you?】. Gon-chan sent me an angry face emoticon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should I ask the two of them to search for Nakajima too? I could trust them, but they were in the sports hall right now. It would be difficult for normal students to leave the assembly… Our homeroom teacher would see and stop them. I waved that thought off and replied to them 【I will be a bit late】.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was there anyone else I could ask...</p>
<p class="null-p">"… That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">I suddenly remembered and sent a message to the campus beautification committee head-- who was also the election committee head. I had never received or sent messages to him before. But I managed to get in contact with the committee head.</p>
<p class="null-p">I told him that Nakajima was being confined, and if he could shift back the speech time slot for Nakajima, and started searching the classrooms on the 3rd floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">After checking the 3rd room, the committee head replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Just made it in time to change the order of the speeches.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【The committee have sent people to search for Nakajima.】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Give me a detailed report later.】</p>
<p class="null-p">His message used the minimum possible number of words. So aside from me and Rika-sama, there were more people searching for Nakajima now. However… we still had no clue where Nakajima was being confined.</p>
<p class="null-p">I gripped the phone in my hand and tapped 【There are no heroines in my youth】's icon with my thumb. If I continue the game, and the game progresses to around this time, my avatar would be able to find Nakajima immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">However-- What appeared before me was the familiar 【Error Code 999999999999000】.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this crucial moment…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I gave up and continued searching the school. But the time I had left slowly ebbed away. I contacted Rika-sama and the committee head periodically, but couldn't get any new information.</p>
<p class="null-p">The student council president, vice president, secretary, general affairs and accountant candidates would each give a speech, and their supporter would give a speech too. I remember the order was the supporter, followed by the candidate themselves. The student council candidate's supporter should be starting the speech, but the order was changed and that would come last.</p>
<p class="null-p">The candidates for student council president were Nakajima and Kiritani. After Kiritani finished, the last one would be Nakajima.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- The election committee head messaged me that Kiritani's supporter was speaking now. After he finished, it would be the candidate's turn. Everyone would take at least 5 minutes, so there was 15 minutes left?</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"…Pandora?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki, you want to find Nakajima Konoha?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course."</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of heroines and whatnots, I couldn't accept Nakajima losing without even getting on stage. That would mean Kiritani-- Amamiya and his people would win.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki's prediction system can't be launched right now. Going by the internal data, it would be launched at 1800 hours today. 【Error Code 999999999999000】 will be fixed by 1800 hours, and you can continue the game with predictions that matches reality.】</p>
<p class="null-p">That was wonderful news. However...</p>
<p class="null-p">"1800 hours…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Forget the assembly, voting would have ended by then.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. And so, I have a suggestion for Itsuki… let's bypass it.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Bypass?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked at my phone with a blank face.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes. The old prediction data is still stored on the server. It is possible to continue the game on the fifth day right now. I connected to the server and downloaded the data.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can do that? Wouldn't that be bad?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【It would be bad if the server detected the intrusion. The data wouldn't be sent over too. On the contrary, it will be fine if I'm not detected. In that respect, this action is a little grey. And of course, there are risks in the event of failure.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-Is it risky for Pandora?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【-- For me? That's true, all that I have learned through my interaction with Itsuki since my launch… The current me will disappear. I might be resetted to my default state. But it's fine. "Pandora" will not be deleted. I will just become the me that spoke to</p>
<p class="null-p">Itsuki for the first time.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora said calmly. That means that if she failed, the Pandora who bombarded me with questions after her visualization, who consoled me and felt troubled by her uneasiness would disappear? It was true that Pandora would still exist even if she got resetted. However, in a way, she wouldn't be the Pandora I knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Compared to me, Itsuki have higher risks. If I failed, you will be judged as failing to secure a heroine before the five days are up, and proceed with forced reparation.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's… never mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was meaningless to say that now.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Don't you know? Before【Error Code 999999999999000】 appeared in the game, Mochizuki Rika was already confirmed as 【Heroine A】. When the game launches again, Itsuki would have fulfilled the quest. Itsuki won't need to face forced reparation.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before 【Error Code 999999999999000】 appeared, my avatar took off his Recycling bag and stated his name. Rika-sama was smiling, and the 【?】 in 【Heroine A?】 vanished.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Do you want to use the old prediction data despite the risk? It might</p>
<p class="null-p">not lead to Nakajima Konoha's whereabouts. And the chance of success is just 32.1967%.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why are you proposing this to me, Pandora?"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Yes, these odds aren't worth recommending. But I think Itsuki… will accept this suggestion.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"… To think it's 30%."</p>
<p class="null-p">【… To think?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm just thinking the chance is that high. I'm very optimistic right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Even the optimistic type can't accept the odds of 30%-- Is this fine?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded. If I continue the game, there was a chance of finding Nakajima.</p>
<p class="null-p">I chose this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Understood. Please hold on for a moment, Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">There was silence. One minute, two minutes, three minutes… "!"</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Pandora succeeded.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Error Code 999999999999000】 disappeared from the screen. After tapping the screen, a certain scene showed up.</p>
<p class="null-p">【I must be blind to think he is a true hottie. I will bring down the hammer of justice on Amamiya after I get out of here! Is someone there!?】</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Nakajima crying for help. Where was she? It didn't seem to be outside. She was in front of a brown door in a room somewhere. The door was secured with a padlock.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Nakajima-san?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【Over here!… Hya! Where did this past year question text book[3] fall from!? Who didn't put it back after using it!?】</p>
<p class="null-p">My avatar and Rika-sama tried to open the lock, but we didn't have the key.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, the screen turned flaky. No matter where I tap or how many times I tried, it wouldn't play on. Which meant the prediction Pandora showed me was at its end.</p>
<p class="null-p">A room with that lock… I have seen this somewhere. And a room with past year exam questions text book.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the library-- in the future prospect resource room? A long and narrow room, located in the deepest part of the library. It could be accessed from the north of the library or from the south of the corridor. Both sides were secured with padlocks. And of course, there were loads of past year questions books.</p>
<p class="null-p">I immediately contacted Rika-sama and the committee head.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Nakajima might be inside the future prospect resource room. I will take a look there.】</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama messaged me that she would be right there. The committee head asked me a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Do you have the key to the future prospect resource room?】</p>
<p class="null-p">【No.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I replied immediately. In the game, my avatar and Rika-sama was troubled because we couldn't open the door. I was overwhelmed after learning the location and forgot about that. Who was holding the key to the future prospect resource room… the librarian? No, that room should be under the purview of the head teacher of the third years, right? Now that I thought about it, maybe Amamiya's gang used their own padlock?-- the only way was to head there and look at the actual thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">The message tone from my phone informed me that the committee head had news for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Don't worry about the key, I will send someone over.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I believed what he sent me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was the first one there. I could hear a raging voice from the southern corridor's entrance to the future prospect resource room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I must be blind to think he is a true hottie. Amamiya, that bastard…! I will bring down the hammer of justice on Amamiya after I get out of here! I will make him wet his pants… Ah! Is someone there!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to the lines my avatar heard, the real thing had greater impact. That was definitely--</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nakajima!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"! This voice… Is that generic face? I'm over here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A bang came from the resource room, Nakajima was banging the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Over here!… Hya! Where did this past year question text book fall from!? Who didn't put it back after using it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I pulled on the door hard, but I couldn't open it with brute strength alone. Nakajima said low spiritedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"… I'm glad you came to save me, but it's useless with just you here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No… The campus beautification head said he will send someone who can take care of this lock..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take care of this lock? What kind of person is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Generic face… If you are just giving me false hope, I will take this out on you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima's voice was filled with grudge.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm just a bystander!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard footsteps. I turned and saw two female students rushing my way. One of them was Rika-sama. The other person had an arm band-Wasn't that the pony tailed girl I saw in the election committee office?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tosa-kun, where's Nakajima-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In there, but the padlock is in the way."</p>
<p class="null-p">I answered Rika-sama, and the pony-tailed student said:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave this to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She gave a quick nod, and her ponytail swayed as if it was alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Tagawa Momo, a first year student from the election committee. The committee head asked me to find the student council president candidate Nakajima-senpai… We need to open this lock, correct?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tagawa took off a hairpin from her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please make some room."</p>
<p class="null-p">A orthodox padlock with a single keyhole was on the door. After I moved aside, Tagawa poked the hairpin into the hole and made clicking sounds. "Amazing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama looked at her with admiration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the special skill of a character I liked. I became proficient in this after I started mimicking him… What an embarrassing topic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Jack from 【Hell·Scream】 huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I muttered unconsciously, and Tagawa turned back to look at me suddenly, with her ponytail swaying. W-What happened?</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-W-What's the matter, T-T-T-Tagawa?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A junior, in something as good as a first meeting, and a beauty at that made me stutter again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tagawa who turned back to the lock sighed. So it wasn't Jack from 【Hell·Scream】?</p>
<p class="null-p">If you asked me about a character that could pick locks, I would think about him. Jack was a playable battle from the second generation onwards. He could take a different route from the main characters because of his lock picking skills, which made him stand out in the story. He was a popular character, and it was a pity he died in the 3rd generation-- or that was how it appeared to be, according the rumours before the fourth generation was launched. He didn't appear when I play co-op with Grandpa on monday. I guess I could just ask Grandpa whether Jack made an appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Heil Cream?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rika-sama tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's useless trivia, please don't mind me senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">Kong, Nakajima banged the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right! Don't distract your junior with that ice cream thing, Tosa!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Not ice cream, it's 【Hell·Scream】... Huh? Nakajima called me by my name just now? Not Satou, Ito, Kato, Taniguchi, Watanabe or something?</p>
<p class="null-p">Tagawa turned the metallic U-shaped part of the padlock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai, the lock is open."</p>
<p class="null-p">After the padlock was removed, Nakajima pushed open the door before we could open it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- You three!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hya!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Senpai?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima hugged the three of us tightly. She pushed our heads together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you! Thank you very much!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I could understand the joy from the bottom of her heart, and looking down at us from high up was very much like Nakajima's style.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, during this happy moment, someone's phone notification rang. It felt scary… like something out of a horror film… As if it wanted to induce fear in others…</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't go out of my way to set music as my ringtone. Rika-sama didn't react either. Which meant…</p>
<p class="null-p">I turned my suspicious gaze to Nakajima. Nakajima backed away from us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait Tosa! Don't look at me at a moment like this! It's not mine! If I had my phone, I would have gotten out of that damn place already! Amamiya took my phone, I think he threw it into the library. Really now, the pain of hearing my phone ring but not getting to pick it up…</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, so the ringing phone belongs to..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Basked in our gazes, Tagawa coughed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my phone."</p>
<p class="null-p">She changed the topic with a "Instead of that,"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The committee head messaged me. The supporter speech for Nakajima had began, plus hurry back." "!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima started running ahead. I sprinted right after Nakajima. After a few minutes, we finally saw the sports hall. We could hear the master of ceremony speaking through the microphone from the open doors.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Please clap for the supporter speech for Nakajima Konoha-san from class 2-1.】</p>
<p class="null-p">A moment later.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Regarding Nakajima-san--】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm here! I'm Nakajima Konoha! Sorry for being late!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima who reached just in time stood out of breath at the sports hall entrance.</p>
<p class="null-p">All the candidates were seated at the back of the stage. Kiritani walked to the empty podium at the center of the stage, and leaned towards the microphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Is it really fine for her to give her speech like this?】</p>
<p class="null-p">He asked the entire student body.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Leaving the reason aside for now, she is very late and we even have to change the speech order at the last moment because of her. The election committee head assured us she will show up and this was accepted. But I don't think we can just let this slide. What does everyone think?-- What do you think, Nakajima Konoha-san?】</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt it should be fine to just tell the truth, that she had been confined. And the one criticizing Nakajima was the one who locked her up. However, Nakajima didn't reveal the truth.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked into the sports hall from the entrance and said not to Kiritani, but her fellow students.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't find excuse for being late. This is my responsibility. However, I have no intentions on forfeiting my candidature for the student council president. Everyone-- please give me a chance to give my speech. If I am elected, I will make up for this mistake immediately."</p>
<p class="null-p">And the result was-- A round of applause from the crowd answered her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you everyone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima bowed and walked up the stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to put a female student on stage at ease-- probably Nakajima's support speech giver-- she patted her hand. She smiled with ease at Kiritani who was hogging the podium, then picked up an unattended microphone from the podium. She didn't look at Kiritani again, and looked down at the students before her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I apologize to everyone present again. I am very sorry for my tardiness. And I would like to thank everyone for giving me a chance to make my speech. I am a candidate for the student council president, Nakajima Konoha from class 2-1. My motto is 【Honesty and</p>
<p class="null-p">Sincerely】. And so, I promise to carry out all the policies I have laid out. Regarding the content of the policies, first…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was Nakajima staring at the line of students leaving the hall?</p>
<p class="null-p">One by one, the students queued up with their folded metallic chairs in hand. After placing the chairs at the store, they left the sports hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">The students were leaving the sports hall where the election rally was held by class order.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the committee head helped to explain our tardiness for us, so Rika-sama and I returned to the back of our respective classes. Tagawa returned to the side of the hall where the election committee member was.</p>
<p class="null-p">The matter of Nakajima's confinement was handed over to the election committee and the teachers. They would call me in for questioning if needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Nakajima's speech was delivered without further incident.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- But, what was Nakajima doing?</p>
<p class="null-p">She walked forth alone from the group of candidates and supporters to observe the second years leaving… No, she was inspecting… No, she was staring at something…?</p>
<p class="null-p">She stopped a male student, and let him leave immediately. She did that several times.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her speech received a round of applause, and her landslide victory was assured. But, was it fine for her to do that? We would be returning to the classroom to vote now, wouldn't her votes slip if she kept doing this?</p>
<p class="null-p">The line moved smoothly, and after I stowed my metal chair under the stage store, I talked to Kazuya who had placed his chair a step ahead of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuki! Why were you late together with Rika-sama? Why why why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I smell a scandal from the incident of Nakajima-san being late."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gon-chan was here too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That trio from class 2..."</p>
<p class="null-p">We turned back towards the voice… towards Nakajima.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah. Nakajima-san is so close to us in the flesh… Hah! No! It's not that, Nami-chan. I'm not being unfaithful, it's just…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Kazuya remembered Nami-chan who wasn't here in a panic, while Gon-chan furrowed his brows… Too bad, you two. We weren't hotties, and would not be distinguished and remembered! The results of making a fool of yourself or acting cool was the same!</p>
<p class="null-p">That should be the case, but a strange thing happened. Nakajima walked towards us, the generic face trio. Her face still looked sinister. On the other hand, she was really incredible for barely keeping up with her sheep skin mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima looked at our face one after another. Gon-chan, me and then Kazuya. She put her palm on her forehead as if she was exhausted, then looked at us in reverse order from Kazuya, me, to Gon-chan.</p>
<p class="null-p">Kazuya whispered to me:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what is she doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Beats me--"</p>
<p class="null-p">I answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you looking for Itsuki? Go on then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Gon-chan said.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Nakajima's gaze settled down. After making a very troubled expression, she stood before me. With her sheep skin mode smile, she grabbed my wrist. Even though this was in this mode, she seemed mysteriously intimidating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can I have a bit of his time? I want to talk to him in private."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, please!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, go on Itsuki!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't say anything, and the two of them replied on my behest. You two…! Were you two overwhelmed by Nakajima's… carnivorous girl aura? Do something to help me! I know the truth very well! But I couldn't say it out loud.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- I was brought to the second level of the sports hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, there's too many people on the first level."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the pure beauty Nakajima Konoha. She was going all out in her sheep skin mode. What was going on? And Nakajima didn't continue, and just kept smiling. It didn't seem like she recognize me, so what did she want with a non-hottie like me?</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was troubling over that, Nakajima asked:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well… do you have anything you want to say?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, right. She wanted me to praise her. Just like the others did. After all, I didn't say anything other than "beats me".</p>
<p class="null-p">"The speech was great."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Generic face! It's you, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She grabbed both my hands and shook me a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's great. I finally found you. What would I do if I brought someone else here mistakenly… I got you on the sixth time… Why is it so hard to differentiate the faces of others aside from hotties… even though I can still differentiate from the voices..."</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Could it be, Nakajima's suspicious actions was her attempt to find me? Staring at the line was just her trying to tell similar faces apart or something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima crossed her arms like an important person and said:</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yamada Taro!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I guess Nakajima calling me Tosa in the resource room was just my imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You gave me the fake name Yamada Taro yesterday! There isn't any student called Yamada Taro in the second year!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, you actually investigated…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How can I not retaliate after being called a cheap woman!? To rebuke you, I started investigating Yamada Taro! Your real name is</p>
<p class="null-p">Tosa Itsuki, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You actually found that out…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Didn't we chat in the library? I know you're in the same class as Tsugawa, so I asked a few of my friends who the male student I spoke to on that day was… but I only got that you're one of a trio in class 2… Since the three of you are in a group, they couldn't tell who I was referring to…!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I averted my gaze from Nakajima.</p>
<p class="null-p">The trio in class 2 were us…? Or were they calling us the three stooges?</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima's tone seem to suggest that. I couldn't accept that. Gonchan and I got average test scores, and Kazuya had great grades despite how he looks! A true scholar!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for the trouble?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Making it a question is infuriarating!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima sighed deeply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- I'm not complaining about all that. I just wanted to thank you. It might be unintentional, but if not for your rude sermon, my bright future would have been ruined. Giving up for the sake of love is unbelievably decadent. I realized that staying with my conviction in love and ambition is the real me. I was in your care, generic face Tosa</p>
<p class="null-p">Itsuki."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima conveyed her sincerity to me. However…</p>
<p class="null-p">"The generic face part is unnecessary."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Next, generic face."</p>
<p class="null-p">My protest was elegantly ignored.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said before that a hottie would be a hottie on the inside too… I take back my words. There are hotties who are ugly on the inside. Even if the face is below a certain score, they might be great on the inside… Although both are in the minority, about 1 in a 100."</p>
<p class="null-p">Nakajima giggled.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- And so, I will deem you worth remembering, Tosa Itsuki. Just barely though.</p>

<p class="null-h1">Chapter 7. 【Do You Wish to Continue? Or End?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the tile roof house I was staying in with my Grandpa. After finishing dinner in the living room, I started playing 【There are no heroines in my youth】.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora's greyish actions weren't exposed, so my prediction system was launched again, with the prediction system resetted.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the playable parts were the fifth day, so I didn't need the prediction to know what happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that time when I leapt from rooftop to rooftop and learned Nakajima's true character. Where I should be rescuing Rika-sama in a cool manner, but ended up being saved by her and ushered into the 【One Person Club】.</p>
<p class="null-p">After 【Error Code 999999999999000】 disappeared, the game continued and my actions in reality were reflected onto my avatar. I located Nakajima, allowing her to give her speech at the sports hall--</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, my avatar ended his fifth day.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Congratulations Tosa Itsuki-san. Tosa Itsuki has confirmed a Heroine within 5 days and satisfied the conditions. You have achieved the possible future of a love life.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ohhhhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I struck a victory pose. Like Pandora already said, the 【?】 disappeared from Rika-sama's name during the game. She felt that it should be fine from this moment on. But the congratulatory message from the system was a completely different feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa who was watching 【Hell·Scream 4】's credit roll turned and looked my way.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Grandpa, the game I gave up on this morning, I completed it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, as expected of my grandson!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa nodded with a big smile when I told him that. He turned back to the television screen and I tapped on my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Hence, the loan had been waived. The record of the 800,000 Sols have been purged from your records. Tosa Itsuki has 2000 Sols in possession right now.】</p>
<p class="null-p">2000 Sols, the complimentary gift from that forced reparation experience. In the end, I didn't use it. Or rather, I didn't know where to use it in the game.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Would you like to continue the game? Or end?】</p>
<p class="null-p">My finger hovered up and down the screen of my phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">-- Could I carry on without this game? Without the preview from the prediction system?</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt uneasy. But at this point, I should…</p>
<p class="null-p">I suddenly remembered something and pressed the icon on the top right corner of the screen to call out the instruction manual. I know where to spend the leftover Sols. The price for the visualization function was 1000 Sols per minute. With my 2000 Sols, it can last for two minutes.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, spending 2000 Sols on that would be the best choice.</p>
<p class="null-p">I selected the visualization option, paid 2000 Sols and placed the phone on the living room desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora appeared before me-- in the form of a silver haired girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">【… Are you bidding goodbye?】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't say anything yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">【It's my intuition, it tells me that Itsuki won't continue.】</p>
<p class="null-p">I nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-- I will end this here. I want to thank Pandora for taking care of me in person at the very end."</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to bid farewell to Pandora without regrets.</p>
<p class="null-p">【You used that 2000 Sols huh. It's great that you went through the forced reparation experience.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to forget about that… Ah, no, I will cherish it as a precious memory."</p>
<p class="null-p">【Fufu… Good bye Itsuki】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good--"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard something from Pandora-chan that I can't ignore… Hmmp…</p>
<p class="null-p">Would you like to continue? Or end? Hah."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Grandpa. I looked towards the source of the voice. Grandpa picked up the phone I placed on the desk. He squinted at the screen while stroking his chin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Grandpa! That's my phone!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Itsuki, that won't do. You have to clear games properly. That is proper manners for a gamer. Would you like to continue or end, that means you haven't cleared it yet. The game is still ongoing?" "Wait…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Grandpa tapped on my phone screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Catch. Work hard on it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I caught the tossed phone in a panic. What did he choose?</p>
<p class="null-p">Could it be, I would need to--</p>
<p class="null-p">【Thank you for continuing the game】</p>
<p class="null-p">"He chose that as expected ahhhh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">【Please become lovers with one of the heroines, the point of this game is to help the player find love. Within five days, all the game function that had been frozen would be unlocked in sequence, please look forward to this. There would be more ways to spend Sols too. Right now, Tosa Itsuki possess 0 Sols, but there would be times when the usage of Sols would be necessary, so we would recommend Tosa Itsuki-san to take out a new loan. Please enjoy this game. Finally, the choice to continue the game can't be undone.】</p>
<p class="null-p">The game continues.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Itsuki……】</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora placed her hand onto my shoulders while I hugged my knees with my phone in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">She made sure that her hand didn't pass through my body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora who expression couldn't match her voice very well smiled naturally.</p>
<p class="null-p">【It can't be helped since it turned out like this. Work hard on this, Itsuki.】</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pandora……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Forgetting that she didn't have a real body, I was moved by</p>
<p class="null-p">Pandora's words and passed right through her when I tried to hug her. My face touched the ground directly. When I stood up and turned back, two minutes had passed. Pandora's human form had disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn it…"</p>
<p class="null-p">After cursing out, I looked at my phone. The system message displayed there filled my mind with question marks.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Confirming current situation. Tosa Itsuki-san has 0 Sols in possession. Your link with Heroine A, Heroine B, Heroine D has been confirmed. Would you like to start the game?】</p>
<p class="null-p">Heroine A was Rika-sama, Heroine B was Nakajima. But Heroine D….</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Heroine D?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I tilted my head, scratched my cheek and continued tapping the phone screen with my thumb.</p>
<p class="null-h2">The End.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">Hello everyone, I am Jin Akime, who will include elements I like into whatever story I write.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that would be the AI in this work. Adding an AI character intrigued me a lot. I feel that this is a great work just because of that!</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, the support AI Pandora for the main character Itsuki in 【Five days】 made her debut. Itsuki got closer to the heroines with the help of Pandora.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, he would jump from the roof with a 【Recycling bag】 over his head-- The 【Recycling bag】, was a 【nylon bag】 in the beginning. My impression of a 【nylon bag】 are the white or translucent type with handles found in supermarkets or grocery shops. It is also called a 【vinyl bag】, 【Recycling bag】 or something. And the first image of such a bag that came to my mind is a 【nylon bag】.</p>
<p class="null-p">But when I was editing my draft, I happened to research 【Nylon bags】 and made a shocking discovery.</p>
<p class="null-p">【Nylon bag】 is actually a limited usage word! It might not be applicable depending on the time and place!</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh no! I had to find a replacement word.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then… 【Vinyl bag】! I researched this, and found out that 【Vinyl bag】 are made from polyvinyl chloride, and is different from the material used in supermarkets or grocery stores… However, 【Vinyl bag】 is still more recognizable than 【Nylon bag】... and the right answer is…!</p>
<p class="null-p">【Poly Bag】 made from Polyethylene. I see! It's Polyethylene… Polyethylene… might be correct, but didn't have the right feel about it…</p>
<p class="null-p">Other choices-- there's still 【Recycling bag】! That's the one! That will work!</p>
<p class="null-p">In conclusion, Itsuki changed his headwear from 【Nylon bag】 to 【Recycling bag】. I started reminiscing how deep the usage of phrase was. The fact that 【Nylon bag】 is deeply rooted in my consciousness is even more of a surprise to me. When did this phrase enroot in my mind…?</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, I'm very grateful to the readers who read this far, thank you everyone.</p>
