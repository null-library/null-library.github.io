<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">It's bad. My heart is beating too loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just why the hell am I so tense!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I've simulated this kind of situation with Natsumi countless times, and even ended up reading lots of nonsensical articles on the net about how to proceed in this sort of situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't stop my hands from getting sweaty at all. Didn't they say today was the coldest day of this winter? I look totally lame like this!</p>
<p class="null-p">Calm down.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should just calm down already.</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no way it would go well if I confessed in this state.</p>
<p class="null-p">Okay, first, let's take a deep breath. If I fill my lungs with the winter's cold air, my delirium would also cool itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, hey, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Disregarding my pointlessly tense and flustered state, Natsumi addressed me with her usual lively tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her scarlet coat and miniskirt whirled around as she spun to face me. Her trademark large headphones hung around her neck just like always; however, maybe because she looked different out of her all too familiar uniform, she appeared all the more lovely today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes, what is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look. It's so pretty!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wasn't that just terrible!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Come on, me! Take a proper look at this scenery from the rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">The whole town is lit up just as much as the Christmas Tree in front of the station. Even Abies Tower, preparing for its illumination at 7 PM, is clearly visible from up here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Misono city is all dressed up for Christmas, and I couldn't come up with a better reply!? What's with "Right"! Is it so impossible for me to say something smarter!?</p>
<p class="null-p">…………...</p>
<p class="null-p">……….</p>
<p class="null-p">…...</p>
<p class="null-p">Is it impossible after all?!</p>
<p class="null-p">In my seventeen years of life, I've never had a girlfriend and, of course, I've never been alone with a girl on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, because of that, it would instead be unreasonable to tell someone like me not to be nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, just look.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's just lovely, her expression was so cheerful that the nervousness from our first meeting had seemed like a lie, and even now her face lit up as she gazed at the scenery before her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really have changed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, what? Riichi, did you say something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You used to be just like a hedgehog."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Wha!? What do you mean by that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what it sounds like, what else? Let's see, you're more like a squirrel now, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Squirrel you say, I'm not that cuuuuute."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said all that, but causing her to blush and feel embarrassed like that ended up making my chest throb like crazy, although it seems she had no awareness of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say that, but aren't you the same, Riichi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You didn't even look me in the eyes when we first met, so who are you to tease me about changing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh shut up! I just had some stuff going on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the point of putting on airs like that? It's not cool and it just shows that you are a shy person, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Youu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I chased after the fleeing Natsumi who had an impish smile that had the word "payback" written on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our laughter resounded on the rooftop illuminated by the moonlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was really fun and lively, and compared to the early spring I think the distance between us had shortened a bit, no, quite a lot actually.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, I said wait!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not happening~ Catch me properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You little!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of us were alone on the rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a school holiday today so there was no chance of anyone coming up here.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, right now, this place belonged to just the two of us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I caught you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyaa~"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I caught her arm, Natsumi lost her balance and collapsed towards me. While I embraced her in that moment, our hearts beat pleasantly in step.</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't know whether that was because I was making merry due to accomplishing that or because of what I was about to try to do from now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Immediately after the easy silence, the tension had taken over my whole body. The hand that was grasping Natsumi's hand had also strengthened its grip spontaneously. That's why I'm sure it must have been transmitted to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact of what I was about to try to do now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">She gazed at me while holding her breath. Loaded with the feelings of anticipation and anxiety, tension and exaltation. Her cheeks dyed in red, with somewhat moist eyes. Her shapely face was heated up as if she was hoping for something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">But my voice trembled despite all the preparations I've done.</p>
<p class="null-p">My throat became dry, and my cheeks became flushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, shit.</p>
<p class="null-p">My heart is beating too loud, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even her voice addressing me was filled with extraordinary feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tightly shut lips looked heartrending, and, even though they were feverish and damp, for some reason they were trembling as if she would freeze up at any moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her dim gaze was looking at me as if it was desiring something, yet there was also timidity in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked awkward and embarrassed, so that's why my feelings overflowed:</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you, Natsumi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And I turned them into words and conveyed them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Opening her eyes widely,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi nodded once.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her teary voice reverberated in my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her every word made my heart tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you too. I love you too, Riichi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I hugged her with all my strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, there was no need to keep suppressing these feelings anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you, Natsumi! I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Yes. Me too. I love you too!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Damnit, what is this, why am I so happy!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what on earth is this!</p>
<p class="null-p">I had no idea there was such a pleasant and passionate feeling that you just can't help but feel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hey, if...if God truly exists,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wish time would stop like this. Natsumi, I'm unimaginably happy now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too, I'm also happy! If only time truly stopped like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">In that way, our feelings of happiness clashed against each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at each other, my heart felt light and ticklish perhaps because of too much happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">We exchanged smiles,</p>
<p class="null-p">And then,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agh‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi vomited blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">In front of my eyes that had opened wide from the shock of not even understanding what had occurred, Natsumi started to fall as if sinking down. Opposite of her spread out hair that gave off a brilliance so pretty that it seemed out of place, the lit up Abies Tower from before was quietly staring down at the two of us.</p>
<p class="null-p">While catching Natsumi's body as it collapsed, I thought in the corner of my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐I see, so blood is this warm.</p>
<p class="null-p">And like this, at 18:47, Natsumi had met her first death.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"!?!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I reflexively shot up.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked around in a fluster, and as I looked at my Smartphone on the bedside it clearly displayed the date 'December 22'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with the feelings of relief, the exhaustion struck my body in the all too familiar room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That scared me."</p>
<p class="null-p">What was that? That dream was bad even as a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why the hell did Natsumi die right after the confession? Who would want something like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, why did I have such a dream at a time like this….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after touching my cheeks, the sensation of lukewarm blood was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, a strange sense of reality still remained and it stimulated my anxiety in an awful manner. Thanks to that, my heartbeat was unable to settle down and alarm bell-like sounds were reverberating inside my ears. On top of that, my whole body was damp with unpleasant sweat and I felt as bad as I possibly could.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, my monologues clearly increased compared to the time when I was in my family house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I saw that kind of dream due to desiring her body warmth? Well, it was indeed nice until about midway, but still..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, I remembered the sensation of hugging Natsumi while I was collapsed on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was so soft and warm, and I don't know what it was but she smelled really nice. Her voice near my ears felt ticklish and above all,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her chest really is huge."</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, not that. What am I even thinking about this early in the morning?</p>
<p class="null-p">Alright, let's not get carried away by these delusions and quickly prepare to go to school. That right now was a dream. In the first place, what's up with rushing ahead when it's not even Christmas Eve yet? Still, just for argument's sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I confessed on the Eve and it also went well, I'm sure it would turn out just like that. When that happens, not just her breasts but also...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, stop thinking about it! I will be meeting Natsumi today. I can't show my face to her when my head is filled with these thoughts."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I rose my body to get rid of such stupid delusions, the chilly air sent shivers down my spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cold!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, since exhaled air turns white even inside the room, you can easily imagine just how freezing cold it must be outside. But it just might be perfect with this. My head will cool down a bit with this.</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking of such things, I took the camera from my desk and headed to the balcony, but the coldness that was enough to make my shoulders shrug on reflex made me tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wouldn't be strange if you ended up sneezing after feeling the splitting coldness of winter in the stinging air.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not minding the cold, I looked through the viewfinder and my head grew colder in one go.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I concentrated, my senses started to sharpen and it felt good.</p>
<p class="null-p">The clear sensation that showed itself every time I set up the camera coupled with the stinging air had spread the calm and serene feeling through my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">All my idle thoughts faded away, and I pointed its lens at the scenery before me as part of the camera.</p>
<p class="null-p">My zen gaze perceived the world in greater detail.</p>
<p class="null-p">Numerous light poles were put along the row of houses. Tree sparrows were resting on the electric lines, and opposite to the residential district there was a business district lined up with skyscrapers. And in the centre of them stood the Abies Tower, which pierced the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The streets of Misono city were once more lit with the low, morning sun of the winter. It shone forth from the stark shadows with a serene atmosphere, and even the very presence of the crowds was bathed in the tranquil colour.</p>
<p class="null-p">A usual morning with a peculiar atmosphere and with a mixture of the usual listlessness and business.</p>
<p class="null-p">Many people let loose their feelings because it was the time to start this new day.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐click!</p>
<p class="null-p">The short sound of the electronic camera shutter hit my ear drums.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuh."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I removed my eye from the viewfinder and took a breath, the serenity I felt when I had the camera set up started to disappear. Ever since I received a camera as a congratulatory gift for entering high school I've been constantly gazing at this wondrous scenery.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, looking at the changing scenery every day and pointing the lens at it from the fourth floor of the apartment feels like I'm recording each and every day and it's really interesting.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why I take one shot for each day.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is both a daily routine and a habit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That said, it sure turned even colder today."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was so cold that it felt like the still dimly-lit sky was preparing to let it snow. I'm sure that General Frost somewhere up in the skies was waiting for the right time to do just that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though if it's going to snow, it would be perfect if it started snowing on the Christmas Eve."</p>
<p class="null-p">If such a miracle truly happened then I'm sure Natsumi would be delighted. Her appearance as she delightfully stops the softly falling snow on her palms would surely be a charming sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I was allowed, I would want to take a picture of such a sight…..</p>
<p class="null-p">"That said."</p>
<p class="null-p">There's also the part where I would feel really awkward. In the first place, what should I even say?</p>
<p class="null-p">Something like 'Please be my model'?</p>
<p class="null-p">Or maybe 'Let me take a picture of you'?</p>
<p class="null-p">I would feel awkward thinking about what I did. Not that I'm in any position to say such thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">But well, if it's Natsumi, I do feel that she would just say 'sure' while acting embarrassed, and that would be quite cute in its own way,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, it's pointless to be worrying about every little thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shaking off my daydreams, I left the balcony behind. The room where the winter's cold air flowed in felt much more refreshing than when I woke up. It would relieve me of all those feelings if I took just one breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, taking the chance to pick up the camera journal with the wornout and tattered corners from the desk while putting the camera on it had also could be said to have become my daily routine.</p>
<p class="null-p">A single photo was inserted on the spread that had a crease to the extent that it opened on its own, and next to it was such writing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First Place - Kuroe Riichi"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it's a short phrase, it's written with the largest letters inside the spread, and it made me feel a mixture of both happiness and regret.</p>
<p class="null-p">That photo, titled "Her World", was something I took myself and submitted for the Readers' Submissions Award that this camera magazine held monthly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never thought it would end up winning."</p>
<p class="null-p">At any rate, more than half a year has passed already since it got published, but I still have no real sense of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when I was contacted by the editorial department about the win, I dealt with it as if it was someone else's business, and no matter how much time passes it still doesn't feel real.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, I'm happy about it. However, beyond that, there are vast, conflicting feelings I have towards Natsumi because of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, this photograph was something that captured her privacy, and I didn't give her even a word of notice when submitting it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's impolite no matter how I think about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's how it is, so why am I delighted about it? Luckily it won, but there's no changing the fact that I've done something insincere towards Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, for that reason, no matter how much I'm praised I can't fully accept it. Even if those were the words of Natsumi herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you reject it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi, with a sullen expression, had her trademark large headphones hanging from her neck today too, as always. Now, at lunch break, me and Natsumi were avoiding the public gaze and were eating lunch inside the empty classroom. I mean, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if we ate lunch together where everyone could see us?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that given? I just got first place by pure chance. In the end, it's just on the level of a hobby."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi who couldn't come to agree with that pursed her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, why are you saying that, Riichi? Even though you've got quite the talent for it. And besides, I, um... I l-like that picture you took, you know…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you are embarrassed about it then don't say it in the first place. Even I'm becoming embarrassed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha!? And here I took my time to praise you! Don't look away now!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, I'm looking away because I'm embarrassed. I'm truly glad to be told that, but facing her in this kind of situation is a bit…you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care anymore! Riichi you idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">While shrugging her shoulders in dejection contrary to what she said, Natsumi started poking her small bento. As someone who bought lots of bread and rice balls at the school cafeteria, I've not the slightest idea how can just that much be enough. She did well growing such drooping fruits with just that amount. Well, I won't go and specify which part that is though.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the picture you took is posted on a pamphlet for new students, right? I guess the teachers thought it was good and requested that. It took first place after all, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying it was just by pure chance. In the first place, since I submitted it without even notifying you, the award is already invalid, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure are honest in the strangest ways. And stubborn at that too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wouldn't it be fine if you were a bit more flexible about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are the only person I didn't want to hear that from."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mgh. Humph. After all, I'm an unfriendly, stubborn and loner girl with a weird head. Fine, I get it already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hey. Don't go snatching others people drinks!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humph."</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite acting displeased like that, her ears were still bright red. She's too easy to read. After all, her being her, she was probably worrying if she said something weird again or something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, really. That picture was something I took because I wanted Natsumi to see it instead of other people. It winning was something that happened by chance."</p>
<p class="null-p">I told the same to the teacher, but it just ended up with them replying with, "in that case, it's all the better for You to take them". Just what kind of expectations are they putting on me?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was pretty sly of you just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"what are you talking about?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing! That obliviousness of yours really irritates me. Do you even realize how I was at the mercy of your whims?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I have no idea what she means. Or rather, why did she start pouting all of a sudden?</p>
<p class="null-p">19
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/boku-to-kimi-dake-ni_4.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Hey, did I do something? If I did, tell me properly and I'll apologize."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah. Why are you turning serious at such crucial points. I look like a fool, being the only one having awareness. Riichi, if you keep doing such things, you'll definitely get stabbed one day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you saying something so scary all of a sudden! Weren't you a bit more gentle when we first met?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up, you...take this...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ouch! Why the hell did she just kick me?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't care anymore. You can be sly all you want. Really, I'm the only one worrying about it, like a fool."</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't get why you sound so awfully happy despite saying that. Rather, even I have lots of things regarding you that I'm anxious about, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">Her atmosphere turned gentle lately and she became cute, and the boys in the class talk about her. It's a hot topic during PE class that she has the biggest chest among the girls, and she says I have no awareness. However, if Natsumi herself doesn't become a bit more self-aware, you know, I might worry about various things like the fact that she might get wooed by someone else or something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Won't it be fine to be a bit more attentive. How about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'A bit' you say, how much is that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Well, y-you know, like giving me a head pat or something….." Unbelievable, I can't see any logic at all. Just what is going on inside that head of hers!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't look at me as if you are looking at something really weird!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no, that's not it! I'm just a little, no, quite surprised that even though you used to have that complete loner barrier surrounding you before, you've really become able to say stuff like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! I'm saying you don't understand it, how to sense the distance between people."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You let out some incredible words there. As expected of Natsumi the loner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, are you picking a fight? Really now. …..Anyway, hurry up and pet me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why must I be told that in such a commanding tone by a girl who has her face flushed red for some reason? That said, when she keeps glancing at me like she wants something I feel like I have to do it. Why is that, I wonder?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But when she pushes out her head so defenselessly there's also the part of me that wants to tease her a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you poke my forehead!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, well, your forehead was just at the right place so..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi held her forehead while looking at me reproachfully as I said so. Becoming teary-eyed and puffing her cheeks like that, she has really become able to show all sorts emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="null-p">This is why I become bewildered whenever she starts acting spoiled like a little while ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, the first time I talked with Natsumi, she was cold and unfriendly. She didn't get close to people to the point that it really seemed like she had a barrier erected around herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now she lets me pat her head and loosens her cheeks in delight like this. You really can't predict how people will turn out.</p>
<p class="null-p">…..Nevertheless, she sure has pretty hair. It's long, silky, and just touching it like this feels great.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you stop?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, should I keep going? I've been patting you for a good three minutes already, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-The time doesn't matter for things like this. Just satisfy me properly….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, damn it. Is this all unawareness as well I wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, you aren't saying similar things to other boys right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm? Saying what? And I'm not close to any other guys aside from you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">I know that, though? That you are a loner, have no friends, and that you harbour memories of loneliness; I know it all. So, how can you say such things directly to my face!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Suddenly looking away like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh shut it, leave me alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So weird. Haha."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those parts of her are truly unfair. Of course I would be conscious about it when I'm told something like that all of a sudden. But, I see. So what Natsumi said before was also the same, huh?</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, my tone got harsher too.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, isn't that how its supposed to be? How can you act normally when you are influenced by such embarrassing emotions?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's really a shame."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The pictures. You should just take pictures even if you aren't going to put them in a pamphlet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I said, I declined that. Can't you just let it go."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mgh. Even though Riichi's talent is something that is recognized by other people, unlike me."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said those words nonchalantly, but because I knew the depth of the feelings she put into them they weren't something I could just ignore. And so,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch!? I said stop flicking my forehead already!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm doing it since you are saying stupid stuff."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean stupid. Isn't it the truth? After all, no one understands what I see, not even you, Riichi. I've become a loner exactly because of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But isn't it different now? Also, do you really think that is so? You also saw the picture that I took right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I told her that, Natsumi showed a surprised expression and she started to blush, and then she revealed a small, delighted smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are sly."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, her words were still as sour as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You might not believe it, but I'm really grateful you know? That's why I'm fine as long as Riichi understands me. Even if I won't be understood by anyone else, even so, I don't mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">Contrary to the lonely words that she muttered, her expression was full of warmth.</p>
<p class="null-p">The pain that tightly grips my heart is a reminder that she lives in a world slightly different from others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not seeing what normal people can see and seeing what they can't see.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi has slightly special circumstances like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">And because of that, she was bullied in middle school.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why Natsumi was always alone and was bad with measuring the distance between people, but for that same reason she acted crabbily, spoiled, and showed various expressions.</p>
<p class="null-p">But now I'm glad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, aren't you gonna eat? The lunch break will end soon, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm, ah, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">The momentary sadness passed away, and I returned to the time of a lunch break that was that was surrounded by distant noise. Natsumi poked at her small bento while I reached out to the pile of bread and rice balls.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a time of silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a relaxing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">There seems to be something greatly important here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, about the day after yesterday, everything's fine on your end, right…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I unintentionally sighed from her evasive way of speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's with that reaction!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'What' you say...isn't that given. How many times does this make it?</p>
<p class="null-p">You bringing up that topic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter, does it? Besides, I'm anxious about it. A-After all, I never had a d-date promise with a boy before….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi please just stop it already. If you tell me that with such bright red face, of course I'll also get embarrassed about it. Oh man, what should I do about these unsettling feelings of mine!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, it's okay, right? You properly promised me, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. Everything is fine, so I'll be waiting in front of the station at eleven o'clock."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so. …..I'm glad."</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this feeling of wanting to run away from this place? I already want to rush back to the classroom as soon as possible. And then open a random window and just scream at the winter's blue sky without reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, don't forget it okay, Riichi. I definitely want to see the illumination of the Abies Tower."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got it. I'll be sure to remember it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi smiled in satisfaction. Her expression was really bright. Knowing how much of a hedgehog she was at our first meeting, I'm overflowing with emotions when thinking of the change she underwent.</p>
<p class="null-p">She really turned cute, I thought to myself. But well, as expected that's embarrassing so I couldn't say it out loud.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Christmas Eve will surely be fun. Let's absolutely make the most out</p>
<p class="null-p">of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt uneasy about it in contrast to the lively Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt a strange stiffness. Before thinking about such feelings lurking in my heart, I realized that it was probably due to the dream I saw today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi fell backwards as she said those words. The redness of the blood trailing down her slightly open lips along with its deep stain on her chest weighed on my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">From that scene that was too realistic, I shut my mouth and slowly swallowed the encroaching nausea, and the sticky and unpleasant sweat travelled down my spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a chill different from the coldness of winter.</p>
<p class="null-p">The strong sense of the reality of Natsumi dying came back all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">I breathed out a deep sigh. I told myself to calm down. It's alright, look carefully. Natsumi is still here alive and well.</p>
<p class="null-p">She's alive. Isn't she right before my eyes?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's nothing. My bad. I was thinking a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something troubling you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those vague words showed that I was wavering. After all, just what could I say? Should I have said "I saw you die in a dream" just like that? To Natsumi herself?</p>
<p class="null-p">Give me a break.</p>
<p class="null-p">It doesn't affect the real her, so why should I purposely say something that'll make her anxious?</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Is it something you can't talk about with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need to delve into every little thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Shut up. Is it bad to be worrying about you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">If I cherish that clumsy kindness of hers, then i can't keep bothering her with my nightmares.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place, "I just had a little nausea", how can I say something like that? Wouldn't it be a waste to spoil the time I spent with her by doing it?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, if you say so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I just blanked out while thinking about the day after tomorrow for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? …..Yeah, I'm looking forward to that day."</p>
<p class="null-p">Look, Natsumi showed me a smile this bright. I'd rather just forget a strange dream like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sky is being invaded by an enemy."</p>
<p class="null-p">If one were to speak of Shiranamise Natsumi, she was famous on social sites as the "Crazy Beauty" who posted pictures together with such phrases.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were also others like "I see you people", "I seek the enemy's true identity" or "Is there no one who can see it?", and I had already heard of her from rumours in the first year of high school as well as actually seeing those kinds of posts myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">While I thought that she was an oddball, my interest in her was also piqued. I wondered what she was thinking to be posting such absurd pictures and not even trying to hide it from other people around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when I actually saw Natsumi she turned out to be way cuter than I imagined.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time I properly met her was when I changed class in the second year of high school. While my other classmates were restlessly chattering in small groups about the upcoming year, Shiranamise was sitting alone and was tampering with her smartphone while listening to music with her big headphones.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a 'don't talk to me' aura that I understood well without needing to say a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">An open space spread out around her due to her peeved aura spreading there, and inside the bustling classroom only that place had turned into something similar to the eye of a typhoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither the boys nor the girls tried to proactively talk to her. Even so, I think that the reason why everyone still stole glances at her from time to time was because she looked so beautiful as she passed the time alone like that. I guess what attracted their attention was her disinterest in interacting with anyone, instead staying silent by herself while her classmates frantically raised their voices in order to pass the time with someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, someone who was clearly a beauty was isolating herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, as I realized later, this attitude of hers was actually just a coverup, and deep down it appears that she was just nervous from her inability to measure the distance between people.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, because of her eccentricity on social sites and isolation in class, Shiranamise had entered the new school year without anyone calling out to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that impression I had of her also only lasted until I had chanced upon her world.</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day, due to some construction work, the door to the rooftop had been left open by chance. Being curious about a place that I couldn't normally enter, I chose an appropriate time and stepped towards the rooftop by myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than me expecting something special to be there, it was no more than a whim to satisfy my curiosity. I might have been able to take some interesting pictures if I went somewhere different from usual, or so I had thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, I'm still grateful towards that whimsical me to this day.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I entered the rooftop, I was greeted by a pile of scrap wood and the sky as it appeared when the day passed 4 PM.</p>
<p class="null-p">During this period at the beginning of April, the days grew longer, and the sky started to take on a soft hue. There, where the bright and clear sunlight fell - she stood alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiranamise was looking at the sky with her smartphone in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">She stood above the pile of wood scraps in silence, directing a gaze, more intense than I ever saw in class, towards the blue sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only an instant. I had no time to think about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had fixed my eyes on her as if I was being sucked in.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, I've often seen her in the classroom before. I was pretending not to have any interest in her. Of course, that would be the case when you are a healthy high school guy and have a cute classmate.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the Shiranamise at that time was different from the usual her during those other times.</p>
<p class="null-p">At any rate, it was a deeply moving scene. As I was stimulated by it, I peeked at it through the viewfinder. Because there was no reason not to click the shutter at this moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the rectangular field of view, Shiranamise alone stared at the sky painfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have no idea just what kind of feelings she harboured. Or even what was on her mind for that matter. But even so, her presence, which seemed to be carrying both tenderness and bitterness in it, pricked my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">What spread before my eyes was a world that was only hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Classroom, hallway, gymnasium and cafeteria.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a place slightly diverged from such daily things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Detached from the 'School' scenery.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Click!</p>
<p class="null-p">And, my finger spontaneously clicked on the shutter.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Shiranamise's world disappeared, matching with the melancholic electric sound that got sucked up into the sky. Because, as of this moment, it ceased to be only her place. Because of a boorish intruder like me, the beautiful and transient world had disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">I went and did it myself, but I regretted that fact. I wanted to stay silent and keep watching her for just a little longer, but that won't come true at this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who is it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice was sharp like ripping the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, uhh. H-Hey there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Pressed by her angry glare together with that voice, that lame reply was all I could manage to utter. I'm well aware that I clearly looked suspicious, by being overwhelmed by the tension and darting my eyes about like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Contrary to my worries of whether I would be reproached, for some reason, Shiranamise hugged her Smartphone close to her chest in an apologetic manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">I remember very well that, for some reason, the thought "she looks lonely" passed through my mind when looking at her desperately trying to hide it as if she had done something bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it one of those pictures? The ones you are posting on the net."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why I had called out to her without thinking. After all, if I hadn't at least done that, it seemed as if she would be blown away by the wind</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Why do you know that!? Wha-, kyaa!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing, I'm fine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her sharp voice resounded once again. My foot that advanced a single step had stopped in its tracks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine, I'm fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that she'd be thrown out of balance at any moment now, and it was dangerous. In addition, her obstinacy to keep me away while insisting that she was okay somehow appeared really clumsy in contrast to her appearance in the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's obviously because you are standing on a place like that. Come on, give me your hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I said I was okay, kyaaa!'</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shiranamise!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It would've been nice and all if I was able to catch her when she lost her balance with that last step but, as pathetic as it may be, I wasn't able to support her and fell down on my back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you climb up on a place like that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You were about to get injured, you know!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-Ah, um, I'm...sorry..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiranamise dropped her shoulders in my arms and sat down as if her body gave up on her. At any rate, there doesn't seem to be anything serious, so I feel relieved for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what kind of sentence did you plan to post alongside it this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The picture you just took. You are going to upload it to the social site, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes. That, that's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">But still, looking at her again, she really is a beautiful girl. She has a shapely nose and big eyes. If only her 'don't talk to me' aura wasn't there, I think she would be really popular.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What is it? Staring at me like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it seems the person was oblivious to these thoughts as she didn't even try to hide her wariness. It was indeed me who one-sidedly approached her, but it's also true that her thorny aura almost made me draw back.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at that time, the blowing wind carried the aroma of spring and it made me feel at peace. So much so, in fact, that it made me tolerate the glare she directed at me from the side; it was prickly, just like a hedgehog.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not really doing anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">When I said that, Shiranamise's wariness didn't show signs of dying down. While she directed a sharp glare at me, she twisted her body and turned her back to me as if trying to distance herself from me as she could. It felt as if I was being attacked by a needle.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was sharp and stung.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-You are lying."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, didn't you touch my body?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a minute, that was because I saved you, you know!? That was inevitable now, don't you think!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But that doesn't change the fact that you touched me. Besides, no one asked for your help or anything….."</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl is way too awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey. Isn't it boring to be acting like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you have to tell me that as if you know anything? Just what do you know about me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know anything. You don't even talk in the classroom, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Isn't it impossible for me to know anything instead?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that she keeps posting crazy stuff on social sites.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that she puts on headphones and plays with her smartphone by herself in class.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's about all I know about Shiranamise. I can't disagree when she tells me that I don't know anything about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, who are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Who, huh? Kuroe Riichi, your classmate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So what's this classmate of mine doing here then? This rooftop should've been a no-entry zone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That goes for you too. I'm not here for anything in particular. If I'm forced to say, let's see... I just thought that since there is good weather today I'd be able to take good pictures from here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that I quickly raised my camera to show her. Rather, this thing isn't broken, right? I feel like it crashed down magnificently when I saved Shiranamise a while ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Pervert!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huuh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You took my picture with that, didn't you!? You pervert!" Thinking back, she kicked and hit me back then too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop hitting me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let me go!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way, I'll get hit if I do, won't I? Just calm down for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than a hedgehog, I felt like I was soothing a stray dog instead. Her baring her fangs at me full of wariness was exactly like a dog.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look, I didn't take any weird pictures."</p>
<p class="null-p">I showed her the picture I took while feeling relieved that the camera was not broken. The small screen projected Shiranamise's sad figure standing on top of the pile of wood scraps with her smartphone directed at the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a pretty picture….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? There's no way I could miss capturing a moment like this with a camera in my hands."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with acting so self-important? Either way, isn't it a peeping picture?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those words don't apply anymore since you recognized the subject as a "good picture". So, it's your turn now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Picture, I mean. You took it, right? So show it to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">I think it was bewilderment and fright that suddenly crossed her face when I told her that. Her appearance as she tightly grasped her smartphone appeared as if she was enduring something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't laugh even if it's bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not what I mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then what else is it? I couldn't easily ask her that after seeing her excessively-troubled expression. Still, if there is something so disconcerting,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think you should just say it properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you acting so self-important?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not acting self-important or anything. I simply thought so, that's all it is. You look to be in pain, after all. If it's just listening, I'm willing to listen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But….."</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shiranamise was still worried. I did not understand just what was it that made her so obstinate, but, nevertheless, I had no plans to just leave the rooftop like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I have things I can't tell others. For example, I wanted a new lens and secretly worked at the school. So, well, how do I say this? There's no need to keep it to yourself so much is there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..You are a strange person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's right. Normal people don't go so far and step into other people's matters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, you are troubled, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are meddlesome."</p>
<p class="null-p">There's this itchy feeling when being told something like that. This time I had no such intention and I just asked because Shiranamise looked troubled, so that was really uncalled for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What colour is the sky for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That sudden question reached my ears with a silent echo. There was an awfully earnest seriousness put into the tone of her voice that differed from the time she read textbooks aloud in the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, because of this, I realized that she didn't ask me this question as some kind of a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The sky is blue. Well, it's different at evening and such."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. That's how it normally is, huh. The sky is blue. Something like that is common sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's an awfully desperate way of speaking. Then, how is it for you?</p>
<p class="null-p">What colour does it appear to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pale pink."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, at active times it also turns purplish."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was troubled about whether I should tell her to go to an ophthalmologist or not. I wasn't able to understand what Shiranamise was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pale pink sky she says, what's up with that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, depending on the circumstances, the sky could indeed appear that way at dawn or evening. But what Shiranamise was saying was surely not about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, what? Are all the pictures you took appearing that way to you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yes. But it only appears as a normal blue sky on the pictures, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about it now, it's no wonder such rumours spread. When they are told something like that, people around her wouldn't be able to understand it at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all, you don't understand it, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, yeah. But, wait a minute."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying so I directed my lens towards the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How does a pale pink sky look, for example?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I gestured the puzzled Shiranamise to come beside me. Then, as we looked at the screen together I operated the camera and steadily changed the hue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's amazing. What are you doing…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm tampering with white balance. It is easy to understand if you imagine a rainbow, but there are lots of colours in the light. It's a correction function for taking a picture with the desired colour tone from among those colours. Well, it's originally a function that originated when thinking of how to capture pure white as pure white."</p>
<p class="null-p">While showing off my vast knowledge a bit proudly, I operated the camera in front of the surprised Shiranamise and adjusted the colours of the sky reflected on the screen. I changed the colour temperature and also adjusted the detailed corrections. On every click, the sky displayed on the screen changed its hue.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky that was a pale orange colour was gradually being tinged with vermillion, and then as I changed the correction value to the blue side, it started to change into a hue that could be said to be neither purple nor pink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's this!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, we finally reached the sky that Shiranamise was seeing.</p>
<p class="null-p">And as the entire screen was being tinged with a pale purplish colour,</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiranamise pointed at one part of the screen. That place was indeed tinged with a faint hue that could be called a pale pink.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is the sky that Shiranamise sees?" I clicked the shutter in that state.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it's still different. The truth is that the whole sky has become this kind of pale pink colour "</p>
<p class="null-p">Her gasping voice reached my ears from beside me. Because Shiranamise was engrossed in looking at the screen, her voice that was no more than a whisper was so close that it was heard perfectly clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, sorry. I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, me too, sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a silly situation where we mutually apologized and separated in fluster brought a slight smile to my face. Along with that, I clearly remember my heart beating faster than necessary from her breath that I felt near me as well as her body temperature that still faintly remained on my upper arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">But when Shiranamise delightfully laughed, I felt my body growing hotter all the more. It was way too embarrassing, so I pretended to be fiddling with the camera and stole a glance at her. Her hair, illuminated by the sunshine while it was being blown by the wind, spilled grains of light only in her surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..So pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, ah, no, I mean, it's...nothing. I mean, you know, the sky. I thought it was pretty. That's what I meant."</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't be any more pathetic. Why the heck did I get all flustered like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">But, I just couldn't help it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiranamise is a beauty no matter how you put it, and her chest was touching my arm until just a moment ago. Asking me not to get flustered would be unreasonable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks, Kuroe-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without regard for me, who was making up meaningless excuses deep down, she faced me with a tender smile. Her expression was beautiful without bounds, and, by the time I realized it, I was standing there like a fool once again, having been charmed by her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are the first. The first person who saw the sky that I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">When I came to, my whole body had turned so hot that it surprised me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No one understood it until now. That's why I'm truly glad to have met you here today."</p>
<p class="null-p">Making eye contact with her is embarrassing, or rather, I'm embarrassed. Why, why did something like this….. "Ah….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying so, Shiranamise stood up and left my side while I was all tensed up inside and advanced towards the rooftop's centre step by step.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hair being brushed by the rustling spring breeze and the gentle smile that was worn on on her face made me forget to even call out to her and I just stared at her in a daze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was bullied in middle school."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then she started talking. I couldn't see her face because she had her back turned on me, but, for some reason, her voice appeared to be delightful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know those drawings done in groups? I drew a landscape during one, but I painted the sky in pale pink. Naturally, I did know that normal people didn't see it that way. But I wanted them to know what I was seeing. So that I could believe that I wasn't alone either. That's all I wanted, and yet everyone started calling me a weirdo and ridiculed me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice, being so clear that you wouldn't think she was talking about her dark past, travelled along with the wind and tickled my ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After that, they ridiculed me at every opportunity. Saying things like, "What colour is the sky today?" and "Do you know of a blue sky?". When reading out aloud in class, when the words "Blue Sky" came out of my mouth by chance, the classroom would be filled with laughter. …..It made me really sad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Emptiness from being misunderstood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sorrow from the denial.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the loneliness she couldn't share with anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiranamise had come so far without anyone accepting the world she lived in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then I should just reject people like that, right? Thinking that, I started ignoring them after I advanced to my third year in middle school. The kids I considered as friends were surrounded by bullies the next day, and I couldn't bear that anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that why you are doing the same in the classroom?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as I asked that, Shiranamise blushed. She seemed to be simply embarrassed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Is it wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haha. You are bright red up to your ears."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nobody asked you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So that's why you posted those kinds of posts on social sites.</p>
<p class="null-p">You were thinking that there might be someone like you in the world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">I thought that there was no need for her to be so blunt about it, but, then again, that might also be asking for too much. After all, she's been all alone until now without being understood by anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you know, I had a little, just a tiny bit of hope. That perhaps there was someone other than me who saw the world like me. But that never happened, and it only made me realize that I was alone." At that moment, I realised it.</p>
<p class="null-p">That everything, be it her obstinate attitude or the behaviour that made it impossible to talk to her, was just a result of her loneliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">That Shiranamise has always been living in such world all by herself, so she had no other choice but to do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why let me say it properly. Listen, I won't say something like this for a second time so listen well. …..Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She appeared very embarrassed when she suddenly turned around after saying those words, but even so, her expression looked more gentle than any other she had shown so far. Her cheeks tinged with a little red, her bashful lips, as well as her gaze filled with affection...each and every one of them was brimming with colour and life.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt my heart skip a beat and then race in turn, its beat thudding through my entire body with a nice rhythm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, it's simple even if I say so myself, I thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">For me to become so conscious of her with just her single smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there's no way I wouldn't. That girl, who was so awkward and didn't let anyone near her, was now revealing her feelings for me so honestly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll bring the picture tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll properly do the finishing touches."</p>
<p class="null-p">And so I left the rooftop alone, leaving the taken aback Shiranamise behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">She might've thought I was sympathizing with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or that I was taking pity on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about what she felt at that moment, I became anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, I wanted to do something for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her bashful face remained deep in my heart without fading.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words of thanks she conveyed to me kept coming back and increasing my heartrate.</p>
<p class="null-p">I just listened to her talk. But if just that little action is enough to make her show me such expressions, I would do anything for her. That's how I felt.</p>
<p class="null-p">I rushed towards my home while feeling like I could do anything. I tampered with my PC all night like a madman and used all my skills to the very limit, and I produced a single photograph.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I believed I was doing that for Shiranamise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I thought that was all I could do for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why I produced a single photo.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the photo I snapped when I first stepped into the rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the ephemeral, yet beautiful pale pink sky, the pile of wood scraps she stood on, the Abies Tower visible behind her, as well as the townscape of Misono city were all similarly dyed in pale pink.</p>
<p class="null-p">Among them, only Shiranamise was full of colour and looked alienated.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why I produced a picture that instinctively made you feel that she was isolated and that she lived all by herself in this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shiranamise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuroe-kun?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I went to school the next day, I called out to her first thing in the morning. She was tampering with her smartphone alone as usual. It could be that today she was making her usual posts once again and trying to find people living in the same world as her.</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, then she was surely lonely and covering them with an prickly attitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here."</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly speaking, I might have been too abrupt. Because the first thing I did in the morning, without any prior notice whatsoever, was present her with an envelope.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at this moment at least, all I thought was that I had to do something for her, and the only correct thing I hit upon was this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think you would really bring it here."</p>
<p class="null-p">While not paying attention to me whose head was filled with such thoughts, Shiranamise opened the envelope and looked down at the picture that was inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the world I live in….. So it was this pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing the picture gently stroked by her fingertip, I felt somewhat shy and embarrassed. I aimlessly looked at the clock and at the classmates that entered the classroom, and then,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Kuroe-kun."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/boku-to-kimi-dake-ni_5.jpg">
<p class="null-p">My eyes met with Shiranamise who thanked me with slightly teary eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The feeling that spread spread through me at that moment almost made me tear up as well without me noticing. I was able to do something for her. That realization had made feelings of delight well up within me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Supposing that there are moments where you suddenly find yourself in love with someone, I believe that they are caused by the most trivial of things.</p>
<p class="null-p">But well, that just might be what we call fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, it was really nothing more than a whim of mine.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, I dropped by the rooftop out of curiosity and stumbled upon the troubled Shiranamise. There was something that I could do for her and I was thanked for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's all it was, and nothing more.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was nothing dramatic about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just a little rapport.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, that tiny feeling was more important to me than anything else, and, ever since that small beginning, I started to fall in love with her more and more.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why this surely was also fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you were playing hooky in a place like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everyone's doing the major cleaning and you alone are idling around like this here, that's no good."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi, while wearing a jersey with her hair up in a ponytail, climbed the stairs towards me. The nape of her neck seemed cool, and it cooled me down just looking at it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not really playing hooky. I was just taking a little rest. Besides, it's December 23 today, right? Just coming to school on a national holiday is something to be praised for."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand that you want to quibble about it. But it can't be helped, you know? All the students are participating in the major cleanup."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You say that, but you are sitting down here yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. It's fine, for a little bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">At any rate, it's not like the overall result would improve even if you gave your all with that cleaning. So, that being the case, there's no harm in taking a little breather.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were few people on the stairway landing located on the rooftop. When we drew closer to each other in order to avoid the cold wind blowing from the opened gate, her warmth transferred to me through the thin jersey.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason the gate that should usually be closed was left open now was to transport garbage that couldn't be put away. Just a while ago, I climbed the stairs with great trouble while wiping off my sweat even in cold weather like this. Well, I got too tired, so when I let go of the trash I held I just sat down on the stairs and took a breather.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi. You have no place in the classroom anymore, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-W-W-What are you saying!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are too shaken!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You said such a strange thing so it's natural that I would be!"</p>
<p class="null-p">More than half year has passed since that spring day, and Natsumi also became quite gentle. However, most of the time she was alone in the classroom, as always, and I've practically never seen her talk to classmates other than me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even you don't want to go back to the classroom, so you are in this place, right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. That's true. In that case, since I'll be going back first, you can stay here a while longer."</p>
<p class="null-p">When I stood up after saying that, the teary-eyed Natsumi clung to the hem of my jersey.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you being so mean. Riichi you idiot, blockhead!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean blockhead….. Well, fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">If I tease her too much, she would start jabbing at me. This should be a good opportunity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, where are your headphones?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, so this is why I felt that the nape of her neck looked cold. The large headphones she always wore were nowhere to be seen, and her white nape was exposed to the cold air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I remove them when doing major cleanups. They become a hindrance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you couldn't bear being alone in the classroom and ran away from there, wait, ouch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">You don't have to pinch me with all your strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, are you alright? Don't you have a headache?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay, I'm fine. The sky is also calm today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. But still, it's so strange. Your headache going away when putting on your headphones."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. I wonder about that too."</p>
<p class="null-p">While saying that, Natsumi drew closer to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hey!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it~?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nevermind."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment when she did such a childish action, i wasn't able to say anything back While feeling the warmth on my shoulder I lent an ear to the distant tumult. This pounding heart...I wonder which of us it belonged to? When I glanced at her, Natsumi had her eyes closed in comfort.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">I got flustered from being called out and looked away. I wondered whether she found out that I was peeking at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, are you listening?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am. What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am glad to have met you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What? What are you saying all of a sudden….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Feeling embarrassed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said be quiet!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, that was payback for some time ago."</p>
<p class="null-p">Damn it, did I tease her too much? To think she would get back at me in this way.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I feel that if that makes her happy then I don't really mind. And also, her chest is touching me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you thinking of something lewd?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course not!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is she an esper or something? I'm getting flustered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi. Do you remember? The time we met for the first time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was here. We met here, on this rooftop."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being told that by Natsumi, I looked over my shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I was plain shocked when you just up and left me behind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, sorry about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But well, you brought the picture with you the next day so I forgive you."</p>
<p class="null-p">But well, she talked in such a cheerful voice that I don't know how to feel about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I'm glad. That Riichi was the one who found me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It was nothing special. It was just by pure chance, you know, pure chance."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to get so embarrassed about it. Because that made me really happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">When she faced me with such a beaming smile, even I became happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Riichi, stay beside me, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Natsumi. Your face is red you kn-, Ouch!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agh, why are you so insensible when it counts? Come on, let's go already. The cleanup hasn't ended yet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine, fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Standing up, we descended on the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm looking forward to tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">While staring in blank amazement, I saw Natsumi off, who went running down the stairs with her hair fluttering.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she tells me that with such an expression, I have to make tomorrow the best day at any cost. Still, even the anticipation of it felt fun now, and I chased after her back as I descended the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">The iron door made a melancholic sound as it rattled in the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, today on Christmas Eve I was the first to arrive at our meeting place, but I can't seem to calm myself down for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">I've been filled with restlessness for some time now. For some strange reason, my hands are sweating badly, even in this cold. After checking my smartphone for half a minute and turning it off, it already became sweaty.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything should be the fault of the surrounding atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">As our meeting spot was in the business district, it was full of people who were waiting for someone, the same as me. Boys restlessly looked around and girls, unable to settle down, played with their smartphones; when there were so many people restlessly waiting for someone, of course I wouldn't be able to settle down myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I seriously can't calm down."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, damn it. If I'm going to be like this, I wish I brought a camera with me. My feelings would have settled down after taking a suitable picture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made a blunder."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ueh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was at my wits' end, so when I was suddenly addressed to from the side, I unintentionally let out a funny voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to be so surprised."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. Did you wait long?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Today's latecomer quickly lowered her head while looking uneasy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's fine, really. I also just got here."</p>
<p class="null-p">I became pathetically flustered. Following last night's scenario, I should've greeted her in a smarter way. What the hell did I just do?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, thanks. For arriving early."</p>
<p class="null-p">I seem to have become quite overwhelmed due to my pathetic actions, but there's no way I would not be healed when she gives me that usual soft smile of hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..So, don't you have something to say to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that while pinching her clothes, and she looked just gorgeous in them.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was too embarrassed to compliment her, so the awkwardness of being asked about her clothes up front made me want to avoid her gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">It goes without saying, but Natsumi wasn't in her uniform today. She wore a white, knitted corset that was taut across her chest and a thick, red coat on top of it. She was also wearing a skirt. Strangely enough, that appearance that I wouldn't normally see made me feel like it wasn't the first time I was seeing it. Even so, her outfit was so appropriate for this day that it made me realize just how important today was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It really…..suits you."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's all I said, and yet why did I have to strain my words out like this? My embarrassment went beyond the limit; I didn't want to stay here even a second longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come, let's go already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, there's nothing that embarrassing about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I stood alongside Natsumi, who was laughing in amusement, and we went forth into the streets of Christmas Eve as if to chase the backs of the pair that went before us.</p>
<p class="null-p">Countless people like couples and families who we passed by gave off a lively mood. It felt as if the entire town was more lively than ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in this town that was bustling with joy, Natsumi, who walked beside me, looked to be enjoying herself far more than usual. Just by looking at her striding lightly, the joy of being together with her today welled up inside me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yeah, I'm glad.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was stupidly nervous when I invited her, but I'm truly glad that I did it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, you are grinning from ear to ear for some reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-!? No! What are you talking about!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are so flustered. And your face is red like a tomato. Did something good happen, perhaps?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She's doing it on purpose, I know it! She has that mischievous expression all over her face!</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said it's nothing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Though, I would be happy if you became a bit more honest with your feelings~"</p>
<p class="null-p">If I could do that, all my troubles would go away. But well, how should I say it, there's no doubting the fact that I'm glad to be with Natsumi today. And so. "Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing, hehe. Shall we go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I took her hand without saying anything and continued walking. Well, it's that. There's no need for words in this situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, while having such an embarrassing exchange, we continued walking through the streets.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally, I would want to start jumping for joy with just that much, but today was different after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">The streets were decorated in a Christmas theme and it was brilliant and colourful anywhere you looked. And I was walking with her while surrounded by such scenery. However, it would be strange for me to be happy with just this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi, look there for a bit! Isn't that just cute?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi looked really cute while spiritedly checking the clothes put in the display window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, try this as well. it's really tasty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Feeding each other brazenly in front of the store made me feel really cheerful. And just for today, we could be together. That fact made me happy and warm feelings spread around in my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">There should be plenty more chances like this in the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">We can do the New Year's shrine visit, and there's also Valentine's in February. There are no class changes when moving to the third year in school, so we'll once again be in the same class next year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, look. What a wonderful sunset."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's that time already, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a cafe we entered, we enjoyed an idle chat a bit too much and completely forgot about the time. Before we had noticed, the sun had started to set and shadows started spreading bit by bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Natsumi. Why don't we go to school for a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why? Did you forget something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing like that. It's just, don't you want to check out the school on a day like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I spoke those words, I could feel a pounding sensation in my chest for some reason</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly the dream I had two days back came to mind, and I shook it off in a fluster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, it does sound interesting, but I wonder if we can enter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. I have the route secured." What was that feeling just now...?</p>
<p class="null-p">That slightly uncomfortable feeling in my heart. However, it was soon painted over by the happiness and warm feelings of enjoyment.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, we arrived at the school in a festive mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think we'd actually be able to enter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said I had it covered, didn't I? WI said I had it covered, didn't I? When taking a stroll to take a picture, I noticed that one of the windows in the art room had its lock broken."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be that you entered without permission even before today?" "Who knows."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're not so much of a goody-two-shoes after all. Don't get me involved if you get in some trouble, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, isn't that the part where you are supposed to say "I'll come to save you"?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I've no obligation to save someone who violates school rules, do I?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I mean. Without me, you'll just go back into being a loner."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hahaha."</p>
<p class="null-p">My footsteps resounded inside the quiet school as I ran from the flushed Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop running already!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">We joked around like that, and Natsumi seemed to be enjoying it as well. But I fully understood her feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">The usually lively school building was now dead silent, the class we casually tried to enter was locked, and we also couldn't turn on the light in the hallway since someone might have found us. In addition, how should I say this, this feeling of being unable to do all these everyday things made us feel quite excited.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the lights and sounds coming inside the window felt distant, and the sensation that we were truly the only ones here had set in.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, it felt that we were doing something quite special at this moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, lucky! The lock is unlocked!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, really? I suppose someone forgot to lock it yesterday."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's probably the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">With those words, I opened the iron gate and the cold wind assaulted me. Christmas songs carried by the wind reached us from the street that was a bit separated from this place</p>
<p class="null-p">The whole town lit up and the veil of darkness had descended in its full might.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt quite mysterious.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rooftop in the evening gave off a tranquil feeling, which was quite different from the school building itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since it was past 6 PM, naturally the sun had already set and night had arrived in full swing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The sight spread before us was entrancing...so much so that it filled me with pride as I answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the shopping district where we had just been, there was an office complex where tall buildings stood next to each other. Seeing Misono fully decorated so gaudily, I unintentionally leaked a sigh of admiration.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a special seat. From here we'll even see the illumination of the</p>
<p class="null-p">Abies Tower."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, this tower was visible from just about anywhere, but, after thinking about the best place out of all of them, this is the place that came to my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, on that day when I had a chance encounter with Natsumi, I had clearly seen that giant tower standing unobstructed in the background.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, I chose this place. After all, this is where everything began.</p>
<p class="null-p">On that day of spring, if either of us hadn't gone to the rooftop then this day would never have come to pass. And, if that happened, I'm sure we would've simply passed each other by as we spent the rest of our days at school.</p>
<p class="null-p">But here we are now.</p>
<p class="null-p">And for that reason, it had to be this place and not any other.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place where I confess to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The empty school sure feels nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I'm glad we came here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence descended.</p>
<p class="null-p">Filling up the space between us, softly, and quietly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……."</p>
<p class="null-p">We were wordless with butterflies fluttering in our stomachs.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was filled with nervousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt each and every beat of my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ouch!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I turned around, Natsumi was grimacing while holding her temple.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it the usual?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">This happened from time to time. I don't know whether the cause was a migraine or something else, but Natsumi sometimes suffered terrible headaches. And at such times, she would usually put on her trademark headphones.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said it lessened the pain when doing so It sounded strange, but it still worked better than the pills she received from the doctor, so I guess it was indeed the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where are your headphones?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't have them with me today, as expected. It's Christmas Eve, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Or so she said but, looking at her grimacing so much, it seems the pain was intense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. Well then. It can't be helped, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi? Ah….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll cover your ears."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was pretty poor for a pretext even if I say so myself. Hugging her just to cover her ears. But, isn't it fine? I was at my limit already after spending the whole day with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">When we met at our meeting place, when we walked the streets hand in hand, when we snuck into this empty school‐I've wanted to embrace her the entire time.</p>
<p class="null-p">And it seems it wasn't just me who felt that way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body leaned on me, and, while at first it merely touched me, she glued herself to me more strongly. I felt her presence growing in my arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her softness, the sweet aroma of her hair as well as her heartrending sighs‐every part of her seduced me. Excitement welled up from deep within me, and it traced down my spine. And as if chasing those excited feelings, Natsumi's fingers crawled on my back.</p>
<p class="null-p">It put me under the delusion of being caressed, and it became harder to restrain myself by the second.</p>
<p class="null-p">I desired her even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, it's too tight!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what of it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah….."</p>
<p class="null-p">I hugged her roughly and passionately. I hugged her body with all my might as if my whole body desired her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her sweet scent and her heartrending sighs...all of it belonged to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it's still not enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was filled with an unbearable longing for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I want more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her existence, her touch, her heart, and even more…</p>
<p class="null-p">I desire more of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her listless and sentimental reply sent a numbing sensation that went through my whole body from head to toe.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, I titled my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">To get even closer to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And to deliver my feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mph"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an affectionate kiss, a kiss to feel her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Full of my feelings to treasure her, just as strong as my desire for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's because I want her so much that I want to treasure her deeply.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't want to hurt her in any way.</p>
<p class="null-p">The second time was more affectionate than the first.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Both my head and my heart were full of Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no room in them for anything else.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this very moment, I felt that only Natsumi and I existed in this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">We separated our lips and stared at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hazy eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks dyed with love.</p>
<p class="null-p">And her slightly open mouth. All were lasciviously inviting me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, the words naturally came from from my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you, Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">In an instant, vibrant feelings of love and excitement overflowed from me.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/boku-to-kimi-dake-ni_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">My entire body trembled from a different sense of delight compared to hugging and kissing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her reply sounded teary.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too."</p>
<p class="null-p">The feelings she was unable to suppress overflowed from her every word.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you too, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the world lost its outline. There was only Natsumi visible in my view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wishing to convey that happiness, I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt her hot breath on my face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Scalding, searing, scorching….</p>
<p class="null-p">Excitement filled the space between us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agh‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Natsumi vomited blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before my eyes widened in shock, she started to slowly collapse. Having collapsed in my arms, her hair spread out and gave off a dazzling brilliance that seemed completely out of place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What...is this even…... Isn't it just like in that dream…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, I shot up.</p>
<p class="null-p">I looked around in a fluster then picked up my smartphone and looked at the screen. It clearly displayed the date 'December 22'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haaaaaaah"</p>
<p class="null-p">Releasing a big sigh, I collapsed on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what the hell was that dream? I thought I woke from a dream where Natsumi died and shot up, but that turned out to be a dream too, and it even had the same conclusion. It's rare to see two nightmares on top of each other, but if possible I don't want to experience something like that. Or could deja vu happen inside of a dream when I'm not aware that I'm dreaming?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't really get it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, unlike the first dream, we kissed in the second one. Which means, in the third one...</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that case, maybe I should see it just one more time. Or rather, does it make this the third one?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In that case, rather than starting all the way from 22nd December, I wish I could dream of that exact moment from the 24th. I don't need such a roundabout way of teasing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this where I should stop saying crazy things and go to school?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps the day after tomorrow I will wake up with some stupid delusions. Stepping out to the balcony with my camera in my hands, I ended up shivering from the excessive cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cold!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, disregarding that, I peeked through the finder and my head cooled down right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I concentrated, my senses started to sharpen and it felt good. I felt as though my senses resembled what I had felt recently, but, disregarding that, I directed my attention towards the scene before me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Numerous light poles were put along the row of houses. Tree sparrows were resting on the electric lines, and opposite to the residential district there was a business district filled with skyscrapers. And in the centre of them stood the sky-piercing Abies Tower.</p>
<p class="null-p">The streets of Misono city were once more lit with the low, morning sun of winter. It rose from stark shadows, bringing a serene atmosphere, and even the crowds were bathed in its color.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an ordinary morning with a peculiar atmosphere filled with both lethargy and haste.</p>
<p class="null-p">Many people took the new day, precisely because it was a new day, to let go of their pent up feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐click!</p>
<p class="null-p">The short sound of the electronic camera shutter hit my eardrums, and, finishing my daily routine, the only thing left to do was to change into my uniform and go to school.</p>
<p class="null-p">I went back inside my room with such thoughts, but the moment I saw the camera magazine that was left on the desk I spontaneously extended my hand towards it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First Place - Kuroe Riichi"</p>
<p class="null-p">This short phrase accompanied the picture of Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">That picture I took on the rooftop where everything began was undoubtedly my best work. But the reason I wasn't fully satisfied with its high evaluation was probably because of my feelings of guilt for submitting it without telling her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I submitted this picture when I was acting quite deliriously. So much so, in fact, that I got up earlier than I usually do just to meet her as soon as I could.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if I stay like this forever nothing will change anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">I would be late for school if I didn't go and quickly change my clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, at lunch break. Due to Natsumi's request, who still couldn't get out of being a loner, we ate lunch in a room with no people.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you reject it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems that Natsumi, wearing a sullen expression, was unable to agree with my decision of rejecting the request to be in charge of the photographs for the pamphlet for new students. My photos were only on the level of a hobby. If someone was to take on that job, it was better for them to be a pro; that was something anyone should understand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the picture you took is posted on a pamphlet for new students, right? I guess the teachers thought it was good and requested that. It took first place after all, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying it was just by pure chance. In the first place, since I submitted it without even notifying you, the award is already invalid, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure are honest in the strangest ways. And stubborn at that too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Wouldn't it be fine if you were a bit more flexible about it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said that, I felt a strange feeling of having experiencing this already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Natsumi. Did we have this conversation before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, did we? I don't really remember it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I suppose it's me mistaking it then."</p>
<p class="null-p">We've talked a bunch of times about me winning first place. I probably mixed it up with a memory of one of those times. After all, be it summer or fall, we've spent a lot of time together since our first meeting in spring.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You have rice on your face."</p>
<p class="null-p">The finger she suddenly extended brushed my cheek. There was a grain of rice on her pretty finger and she put it in her mouth without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At least say so before you do something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said it didn't I? That there was rice on your face."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You could've said something else, right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? Are you perhaps embarrassed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, our lunch break passed quietly as we chatted about such things.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, about the day after yesterday, everything's fine on your end, right…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I unintentionally sighed from her evasive way of speaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's with that reaction!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"'What' you say...isn't that given. How many times does this make it? You bringing up that topic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't matter, does it? Besides, I'm anxious about it. A-After all, I never had a d-date promise with a boy before….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hm? Haven't I seen this current expression of Natsumi somewhere before?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Riichi, don't ignore me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Oh. Sorry. Anyway, everything's fine. In front of the station at eleven o'clock, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup, that's right. And then, we'll watch the illumination of Abies Tower together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I know. That reminds me, I don't think I've seen the Christmas illumination before this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it becomes the main topic when this time comes around every year, I usually don't particularly have any plans to see it; rather, it is pointless to stroll on the street on Christmas Eve, so I never go out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"M-Me too. That's why this year I want us to see it together no matter what…..Okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wow, what is this? I feel happy for some reason. So there's a girl who would say these kinds of words to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Christmas Eve will surely be fun. Let's absolutely make the most out of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">In contrast to the lively Natsumi, I'm experiencing a stronger feeling of deja vu than I've had until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this?</p>
<p class="null-p">What's even going on?</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't really get it, but those words left a bad impression on me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words that were etched in my mind were the words from the dream I saw this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Experiencing déjà vu about a nightmare while… inside of a nightmare isn't something that I'm happy about.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her worried voice quickly brought me back to my senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something wrong? Your complexion looks poor."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah. I'm fine. It's nothing. I just remembered a dream I saw today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"A dream?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry about it. I just woke up in a bad way, that's all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi had a bit of a lonely look on her face, but how can I even tell her about such a dream? In the first place, just because I saw that dream doesn't mean something like that would happen in reality. In reality, Natsumi will continue living and stay by my side, just as she has done so far.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that case, there's nothing to worry about, is there?</p>
<p class="null-p">Those awful moments of déjà vu accumulated as the day progressed, and, as horrible as it may be, the next day that sensation assaulted me thrice. Puzzled by it, I looked it up on the internet and it was apparently not all that rare, so I ignored it. Well, that said, it was no more than the feeling that I've experienced this before, so there was no use worrying about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, Christmas Eve arrived. I was the first to arrive at our meeting place, and I was attacked by that sensation yet again. I have seen it. These congested streets, this scenery. I've definitely seen it somewhere…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Riichi. Did you wait long?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, after seeing Natsumi's appearance, that feeling turned into firm conviction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why... those clothes..."</p>
<p class="null-p">She wore a white, knitted corset that was taut across her chest and a thick, red coat on top of it. She was also wearing a skirt. There's no doubt about it. I've definitely seen those clothes somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do they look...weird?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. Not at all. They look good on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">But I couldn't tell something like that to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehehe. Your clothes look quite nice as well. ...So, shall we go?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I followed after Natsumi who started walking in a lively manner, and we headed towards the shopping district; but still, these questions kept going round and round in my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why?</p>
<p class="null-p">How?</p>
<p class="null-p">Aren't these clothes she's wearing the exact ones she wore in that dream? Why is she wearing them now?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, look! Aren't these clothes cute?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Which-huh..."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Natsumi pointed at with lively expression was a mannequin put in the display window. But, wait a minute. Haven't I seen that one as well? At that time, Natsumi pointed at that very thing with a lively voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">I confirmed my surroundings in a fluster.</p>
<p class="null-p">People came and went with Christmas songs playing in the background. To me, that scene of people happily strolling around appeared as something very frightening.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi? What's wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's nothing. Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on. How about you put aside your daydreaming for another day."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah. I got it already... huh, Natsumi!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I can't?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She shyly linked arms with me, and we continued walking in high spirits without letting go. Just walking through the street filled with Christmas colours should've been something to be happy about, but for some reason I was filled with inexpressible uneasiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi, try eating this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah, this is tasty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, I had to strain myself just to put those words together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, let's enter that cafe for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sounds fine. It looks like a neat place."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even my smile ended up being somewhat forced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hidden under my enjoyment, there was this anxiety I couldn't get rid of. I felt heavy as if there was something I couldn't clearly express.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, look. What a wonderful sunset."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, it's that time already, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened the moment I said those words. I was assaulted by the strongest déjà vu of the past three days.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scenery, the exchanged words, and the feelings I held. All of these mixed with each other and they all started clattering inside my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's scary. Should I really ignore something that's bothering me this much...?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, let's move somewhere else."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the plan?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go somewhere from where we can clearly see the Abies Tower."</p>
<p class="null-p">In reality, I had planned to take her to school and watch the moment when the Abies Tower lit up from there. However, I felt that it was a bad idea. After all, Natsumi had died twice on that rooftop if I include the dream I had the day before yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">That said, even if I search for some other place now, I doubt there would be any open shops around considering what day today is.</p>
<p class="null-p">With those thoughts, I faced towards the gaudiest and most peoplefilled avenue within the shopping district.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow! It's amazing, Riichi. So pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Natsumi said, with the liveliest voice so far, the avenue scenery was certainly beyond my imagination. So much so that I even forgot my anxiety for a moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Stone-paved roads stretching straight ahead. On both sides of it, which had the width of about four lanes, gingko trees, having been covered with vivid autumn leaves until just recently, stood in rows. Now that the season had changed, each one of them was covered with dazzling decorations.</p>
<p class="null-p">And beyond the road was the Abies Tower, which we looked forward to the most, standing tall.</p>
<p class="null-p">That somewhat, or rather, quite beautiful scenery also made other passerby people raise their voices in admiration and stop to take pictures of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, let's take pictures too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hey. Don't be so hasty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi, full of liveliness, clung to me tightly and set up her smartphone and tried to fit both of us on the screen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, come closer. I can't take the picture."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it, you don't have to press me so much."</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be annoying to those looking at us from the side, but today was Christmas Eve. I want them to overlook us this much.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look look, Riichi, it turned out pretty nicely."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, you sure are in high spirits today. Don't get too worked up and get yourself hurt."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't treat me like a kid already! I'll be fine. ...Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah..."</p>
<p class="null-p">When it comes to peering into the tiny screen of a smartphone, you naturally have to draw your face near it, and with this congestion on top of it, we ended up being glued together. Wow, there's even a couple kissing just next to us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-It somehow reminds me of that time. You know, when we met at the rooftop."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi also stole glances at that couple while playing with her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah. That's right. It also turned out like this back then."</p>
<p class="null-p">It's not just because we were close. My heart was racing and heat accumulated on my cheeks, but it's not just those reasons.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I called out to her, urged by my heart that pounded like alarm bells, I felt that my tone sounded different from usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even her reply contained a certain charm different from usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said it with a timing that can only be described as impulsive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">She nodded in teary voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Me too."</p>
<p class="null-p">The feelings she was unable to suppress overflowed from her every word.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you too, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the world lost its outline. There was only Natsumi visible in my view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wishing to convey that happiness, I closed my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt her breath behind my dark eyelids.</p>
<p class="null-p">Scalding, searing, scorching….</p>
<p class="null-p">Excitement filled the space between us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, run away!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's falling!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look out!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I opened my eyes due to the screams from all around, I saw a roadside tree falling down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And Natsumi got swallowed up before my eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A sudden exploding sound reached my ears as I stood there stunned. It was followed by an unusual burning smell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's burning‐!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite hearing someone's yell, I couldn't move a step. I stood completely devastated, unable to even think. Then, only after someone pulled my hand did I finally come to my senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah…Aaaa…Aaaaaaaaaaa!!! Natsumi, Natsumi, Natsumi!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said it's dangerous, get back!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! There, Natsumi... Natsumi is...!!" After hearing the explosion.</p>
<p class="null-p">And after looking at the burning gingko tree I finally noticed it. This was definitely not a dream. And the tree was without a doubt burning before my eyes... and Natsumi was also there.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Then I shot up and checked my smartphone in a fluster.</p>
<p class="null-p">The date was 'December 22'.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did time...turn back...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">My single mutter got absorbed by the atmosphere of my empty room.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you reject it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Speaking honestly, I can't comprehend this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what the hell is going on?</p>
<p class="null-p">Before me was Natsumi with sullen expression eating her snugly bento. Be it this room with no people, or her appearance itself, I had a strong remembrance that couldn't be called a coincidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">And it's not just that.</p>
<p class="null-p">This morning, before coming to school, inside the class, on lunch break and on countless other occasions I was attacked by a Déjà vu which made me greatly perplexed. I only felt dizziness from that sensation, as if the pages of my memory were forcibly flipped at terrible speed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that given? I just got the first place by pure chance, in the end, it's just on the level of a hobby."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even these words felt like they were being read from a set script, and while I can't say it for certainty, I didn't even feel like I was the one saying them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what is this?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, why are you saying that, Riichi? Even though you've got quite the talent for it. And besides, I, um... I l-like that picture you took, you know…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you are embarrassed about it then don't say it in the first place. Even I'm becoming embarrassed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha!? And here I took my time to praise you! Don't look away now!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Our conversation advanced despite my bewilderment. Even that felt weird, like I was re-watching a Drama I saw once.</p>
<p class="null-p">I somehow knew what Natsumi was going to say after this, and even the reply I would give. But, that's just strange, isn't it? This is the reality, not like some answer checking from a reference book that I've solved many times, is it? What is this really? What's with this situation…..</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up! I'm saying you don't understand it, how to sense the distance between people."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right, after this, for example. Natsumi would readily present her head to me, but I would be too embarrassed to obediently respond to it and would play a prank on her by flicking her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Anyway, hurry up and pet me." See. It happened as I predicted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha ah yuu doin!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pfft, what a weird expression."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So cruel!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, damn. Following my memory like this annoyed me, so rather than a forehead flick I pinched her cheek instead, but it seems I made her angry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know you anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, it was my bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She faced the other way with a pout, but it was clear from her expression that she wanted something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, I gave in and gave her a head pat.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was also in my memories, but seeing her satisfied expression, I just thought it was fine to do it. Also, her hair felt nice to the touch as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you stop?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, should I keep going? I've been patting you for good three minutes already, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-The time doesn't matter for things like this. Just satisfy me properly….."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, damn. Cute things are cute, even if you know about them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This should be enough for today. At any rate, it's Christmas Eve the day after tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened when I said it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The strongest sense of Déjà vu so far came to assault me.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt as if a box with a thousand pictures in it was being forcibly turned over. Several of them, which got chosen against my will, all lead to an undesired future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agh‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. That fresh blood was too red and left a slippery, warm sensation on my cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's burning‐!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those flames blazed up, burning so brightly it even burned the eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Bang!</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi…..?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi looked up at me as I suddenly stood up. But I've had no composure to answer those curious eyes of hers.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all...After all, if what I just saw wasn't just some Déjà vu but something that actually happened in reality, would Natsumi die...again...?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha...Haha."</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't reject the possibility.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because the anxiety knocking strongly on my heart was informing me of one fact.</p>
<p class="null-p">That Natsumi had already died several times.</p>
<p class="null-p">That I had seen that happen many times, but each time I convinced myself that it was just a dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what's wrong, Riichi. You've got a terrible complexion."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was that worried about me, but there's no way I could just tell her everything was all right. The chills on my body weren't from the chillness of winter, much less from the bad physical condition.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl who was gently holding my hand right now might die. It was due to my conviction towards such unrealistic future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About Christmas Eve, do you want to see Abies Tower illumination no matter what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What happened all of a sudden?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, just answer me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, yeah, I do, but why all of a sudden?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">I sat down a little roughly and stretched my hand towards the rice ball in front. As I roughly bit down on it in order to shake off my inner anxiety, the sourness of the plum stimulated my tongue. And with that, my head cleared up. We've met the Christmas Eve outside so far. In that case.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About Christmas Eve, won't you come over to my place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What? That was so sudden."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Abies Tower can be seen from my balcony too. So, isn't it fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right, it should be fine inside the house. Trees won't come crashing down inside it, so it is the safest place to be.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, even for an invitation, wasn't there a bit better way? Ah, I'm not saying I dislike the forceful approach. But, um... how should I say, even I have a situation I wish for..."</p>
<p class="null-p">...What is she saying all of a sudden? Why is her face so red? I simply told her I wanted for us pass the Christmas Eve at my house-Ah... so that's it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, Natsumi. Wait a bit. How should I say, you misunderstood it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Misunderstood you say? But inviting me over on Christmas</p>
<p class="null-p">Eve…..means that, right...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">No, well...that might be how it usually is, huh!? But this is no time for that, is it!? Well, that said, it's not like such thoughts never crossed my mind either.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That wasn't my only goal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">How should I even answer when she's showing me those upturned eyes. Why are there no Déjà vu now when I need them the most!? ...Maybe because something like that didn't happen between us yet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, leaving that aside, are you sure about spending the Christmas</p>
<p class="null-p">Eve at home?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Please stop with that delicate voice. It's shaking my desires.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason I was able to have a peace of mind at that moment, was because deep down, I thought that everything would turn out fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Deep down, I thought optimistically. That the death scene of Natsumi I witnessed thrice, and the rewind of time on each of those occasions were too unrealistic, so they had to be a dream after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly, what a fool I was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite reality being much severe, and unforgiving.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, it's embarrassing so...turn off the lights."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah. That's right."</p>
<p class="null-p">The illumination of the room died down along with a click. The only things faintly clearing away the sudden darkness were the moonlight passing through the curtains and the gaudy shopping district seen in the distance. The reason I was restless rather than being able to relax in this room I was supposed to be familiar with, was most likely due to the faint rustles of clothes that reached my ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">The wavering mood stroked not only my ears but also my heart, and due to that, I couldn't relax at all. My throat gave out rough noises, and my heart was unable to settle down no matter how many times I took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, it's fine now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice that had all the courage mustered into it made my shoulders jump up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Don't stare...too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">When I turned around, Natsumi stood there,within the darkness, in nothing but her underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Stop staring..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her feeble appeal made me turn my gaze away in fluster. But there was the sweater I just took off lying there, and it filled me up with inappropriate embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">As stood there without saying a word, the room got filled with strange atmosphere mixed with unbearable excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a sound of gulping the saliva, but I didn't know which of us were responsible for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, I at least understood that both of us were full of tension.</p>
<p class="null-p">I released a small sigh. I turned towards her after resolving myself, and there stood Natsumi hugging herself in a helpless manner.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her white underwear was far too pure, even more so when compared to the dark lust of my base desires. But the abundant breasts that filled it were bursting with sex-appeal and felt very, very inviting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">…..Crap, I don't know what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">The events led to this situation, but how do I proceed now? No, seriously. I really don't know. I decided to take a step forward, and Natsumi held her breath. Her tensed up expression invited even more impatience in me.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/boku-to-kimi-dake-ni_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her moist eyes looked up at me. Shaken by her insecure look, my heartbeat became even louder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…..Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you!"</p>
<p class="null-p">My abrupt confession reverberated within the room. Did I just confess AFTER stripping? Wasn't it too abrupt to confess like that? My stupidity moved me to tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, it was something I had to convey to her, no matter how awkward or uncool it turned out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi became shy from delight even from such clumsy confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">It happened when she said those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The shock that reverberated through my whole body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It's an earthquake! The moment I thought that, the room bookshelf fell down, as if aiming for Natsumi...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi!!" ‐‐Crash!</p>
<p class="null-p">It gave off a crude sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">And before my eyes was Natsumi with blood spilling from her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I raised such idiotic voice while staring at her blood that gradually spread through the carpet, and my consciousness was cut off there.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, I shot upright and checked my smartphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">December 22.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In a fit of rage I flung it away and after bouncing on the floor it glided towards the corner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't fuck with me damnit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, I wasn't even sure where my anger was directed at. Even so, these absurd circumstances forced me to say something or I wouldn't be able to calm down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the heck is this. Just what is going on!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even my angry yell disappeared through my lifeless room, there being no one to hear my words.</p>
<p class="null-p">A hopeless sense solitude and emptiness started to assault me. On top of the chilly air in my room, even my heart started to be dyed in coldness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what...is happening…"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was already the fourth time based on my memories...where I saw</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi die. And my fifth time to wake up on the morning of December 22.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't make heads or tails of it anymore. I had no idea of what was going on...why was it happening to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did she die even in this room. Wasn't she just there? She lay over there, and the blood…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ugh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When that scene floated up in my mind, a strong feeling of nausea welled up within me. I rushed towards the bathroom and hung my head on the bowl, and started vomiting everything I ate last night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uegh, haah, haah… Fuck."</p>
<p class="null-p">I gasped out, my mouth tasting of vomit as I sank to my knees. My head throbbed in pain, reducing my vision. Was this it? Was I helpless now that I got caught in this loop...this cage of time? Such fears filled my being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, I don't care who...at least tell me the cause of this…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But alas, just who would answer those words? Just who would answer to me, being all by my lonesome in this narrow toilet…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Give me a break."</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe because I kept vomiting for a while, I could feel something strange bubbling out from deep within me. That strong, stormy emotion painted over the anxiety that was assaulting my mind prior to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see. I'm pissed, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">This emotion was the same as the one when I woke up.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the anger towards this unreasonable, absurd and completely nonsensical state of affairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was the cause of it?</p>
<p class="null-p">What was the trigger and how did it work?</p>
<p class="null-p">I pondered as I drank the water I fetched from the fridge.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did I end up in this situation, why was I suffering like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">But the information I possessed was far too little. I only had a rough idea that I was looping between December 22 and 24.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it Natsumi's death?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I have no proof. But I'm certain that I lose consciousness right after witnessing her death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hey, I don't know who is making me go through all this, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"At least show your face."</p>
<p class="null-p">Otherwise, I can't make any sense of this at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">But still, I think I've made a little breakthrough. It's certainly an irrational situation, but still, I just have to understand it.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this situation, what is the cause, and what should I do to break away from the present condition. In order to figure that out, I have to act.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fortunately, I have some clues." Thus, I sat before my PC.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why? To watch the movies, of course.</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently I'm trapped in what is commonly referred to as time rewind, time leap and loop. Well, that's unless I'm dreaming or just going crazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if I'm right, then there's no problem. Even someone as unknowledgeable in the field as me knows a few of those movies. If I watch those, I might stumble on some kind of hint.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to at least let Natsumi know, though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel sick, so I'll be taking a day off."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as I sent that short message, I felt anguished remembering the scene of her death. I was filled with a sense of duty: I had to do what I must in order to not let Natsumi die any more than this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Booting up the PC I looked up the titles I could remember and binged through them one after another. Loops that many protagonists faced. Their thoughts, their imaginations, their actions. Those were all the things I needed to know now. Thus, I kept on watching, praying that I could find some kind of clue that would help me among them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, are you sure you are alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said I am. You really are a worrywart, Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus came December 23. This time, I properly attended school and participated in the school-wide cleaning. After all, if it took two days off, Natsumi would be worried something was up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know, you still look a bit unwell, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, that's natural. I was watching movies from morning to night, and continued all the way until the dawn came, thinking of a way to break out of this loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to that, I was lacking sleep. Though that also backed up my excuse of feeling unwell yesterday, so I was not sure how to feel about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. It'll go away after a night of sleep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi observed me with a worried look. Since I arrived at school, she's been asking me about how I felt at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, were you fine yesterday? You have no one to talk to if I'm not there, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"O-Of course I was!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your voice is trembling there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave me alone, Riichi you idiot!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait. Slow down or you'll get hurt."</p>
<p class="null-p">She ignored my warning and hurried ahead. Though I was the one carrying most of it, it was still quite admirable that she managed to run up the stairs with all that trash in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I chased after her fluttering hair, we arrived at the rooftop. The clear, blue sky of winter was spread out above us, but the blowing wind was chilly, and the temperature was not exactly the kind where one would last with only a jersey.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey. Let's quickly drop these off and return, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She got rid of the trash as she said that, making the pile a little bigger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't this growing a little too big?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, a lot of things happened recently, like cultural and sports festivals."</p>
<p class="null-p">As a proof to that, the trash pile contained things with "Yakisoba", "Haunted House", "Red Team", "Score Board" and other similar writings.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's been a little over half a year since I met with Natsumi. I even felt that this pile contained a lot of our memories of this time period.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can even see the Abies Tower quite clearly from here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you are right."</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason I came here during the second loop was because of that. I knew that we would be able to see the Abies Tower without obstructions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I hope tomorrow would be clear too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It should be fine. They said it might get a bit worse the day after though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hope they aren't off. Those weather forecasts aren't all that</p>
<p class="null-p">accurate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's cold enough as is. It wouldn't be a joke if it started raining on top of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Exactly. Maybe I should ask Mr. Santa for that. "I don't need your presents, just give me a clear weather tomorrow" or something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would you request that. Wouldn't asking for gifts be better?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I don't really mind that. I get to be with you, after all. Right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words stunned me for a moment. To clearly express her feelings like this, she truly has changed a lot since we met.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you looking so melancholic?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking that even that hedgehog Natsum has changed a lot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-Who are you calling a hedgehog."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the truth, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No it's not!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She stuck her tongue out, then turned around and walked away. As I chased after her back, I turned around to take one final look at the Abies Tower.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm not going to let Natsumi die ever again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus came December 24. Just like before, I was waiting for Natsumi at the meet-up place on the shopping district. I am in a loop. After being aware of that fact, I wasn't sure what to do and all that tension I felt during the appointment was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Far from that, I was calmly looking around and observing my surroundings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe there was something off somewhere? Maybe if I could find some kind of change that I overlooked the last time, it could become a hint to get out of this loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt like I was playing photo hunt.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the movies I watched taught me that this was an important thing to do in order to get out of the loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although there were countless works dealing with time loops, only a few of those served as a reference. Most of them were stories about protagonists trying to avoid the heroines meeting their tragic fates, starting with a small thread and and reeling it in, making their way towards the correct route. Are you some kind of detectives or what! I retorted, but that was apparently the best way of handling it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you looking so serious for?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I was so lost in thought, the voice coming from my side made me jump in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you a bit too surprised?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Responding with that teasing remark was today's latecomer, Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. Did I make you wait?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all. That aside, those clothes look good on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-Really? Ehehe, thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">Before I knew it, I became able to say even these kind of lines without hesitation. And so, we headed towards the street, walking together through the shopping district full of people.</p>
<p class="null-p">While passing a fun time like this, I made sure to keep one thing imprinted into my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was to avoid her "I love you".</p>
<p class="null-p">The day before yesterday, after I finished watching the movies, I desperately pondered. What did I have to do to escape from the loop? What was the cause behind this? Why was it me?</p>
<p class="null-p">Unfortunately, however, I could not figure out the origin or the reason, however when it came to breaking free from it, I found one small but definite hint.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, I assumed that Natsume's death itself was the trigger. However, after thinking back on it really hard, I noticed that that wasn't the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Agh‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Natsumi collapsed while vomiting blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's burning‐!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she was clad in flames.</p>
<p class="null-p">And even the last time, when she collapsed in my room, she died right after saying "I love you", followed by me losing consciousness and looping.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">If these appealing words were indeed the trigger, there could be nothing more miserable than this. However, if saying those words lead to Natsumi's death and looping, then I had to avoid them no matter the cost.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, look! Aren't these clothes cute?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, they are."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is something on your mind again?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, you are imagining it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lies. You were definitely spacing out just now. Come on, stop being in such a daze."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at the pouting Natsumi, I thought to myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Do I really have to avoid that "I love you" at all costs?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I love her so much?</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I guess it's the other way, huh..." I muttered in a low voice so that Natsumi walking next to me couldn't hear.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had to avoid those words exactly because I loved her so much. If I didn't wish to see her dead body once more, I had to avoid it no matter what. Regardless of the sorrow it would bring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the day darkened as we passed the time strolling the streets.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, let's get on the train for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"? Where are we going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"To this one nice spot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What kind of answer is that," Natsumi chuckled in response as we boarded the train. It traveled on elevated ground and we could clearly see the dazzling Christmas Eve townscape through the windows.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rattling of the train as it sped along the rail incited a quiet anxiety in my chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">19 hours ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know the exact time, but even so, this time period should be when I usually loop. If I somehow evade that, I should be able to escape from this absurd situation too.</p>
<p class="null-p">But for that, there is one thing I must do no matter what.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Riichi. Isn't it a bit cold?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As the doors opened, the blast of the wind made Natsumi to cuddle closer to me. I grasped her hand and slipped it into my pocket. My heart started beating loudly. Her fingers, entwined with mine as if depending on me, gave me the courage I so needed.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was this hand. To protect this very hand, I had to strengthen my resolve.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our figures reflected in the dark windows were heartlessly contrastive, filling me with sadness. I wonder why? Why is it that, even though Natsumi has such a gentle and happy expression, I am staring at the window with such an empty expression?</p>
<p class="null-p">Between our entwined fingers and our contrastive expressions, I was losing sight of which of them were my true feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, the next stop is where your house is, Riichi… Are we getting off there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I responded to her words tinged with expectations with a shake of my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Without a word I grasped her hand in my pocket.</p>
<p class="null-p">Gently, as if not to break it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hoping that my feelings would reach her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sorry, Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">But know that what I'm about to do now is by no means a betrayal.</p>
<p class="null-p">I will definitely apologise for it later.</p>
<p class="null-p">I will properly make up for it, and if it doesn't appease you, you can be angry at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sorry. I'm...honestly sorry.</p>
<p class="null-p">The train slid into the station platform and the doors opened. Several passengers passed by before us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it, Riichi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The departure announcement rang out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This will be it for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">I quickly separated our entwined fingers. And just as the doors started to close, I got down to the platform. Instead of pulling her along with me, I left Natsumi back in the train. Her fingertips, dangling in midair and trembling painfully, spoke for her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She sounded dumbfounded, lost even. And hearing that voice shook my heart to the core, but I still turned my back on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I desperately endured as the train prepared to depart, restraining my legs that tried to return back to her with all my might. If I returned now, everything would come to nothing. Don't forget why you got off the train.</p>
<p class="null-p">You love her, don't you?</p>
<p class="null-p">You don't wish to see her die once again, do you?</p>
<p class="null-p">If so, then grit your teeth and stand your ground, Riichi!</p>
<p class="null-p">And when tomorrow comes, I can run to her side once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, I will even prostrate before her and apologise with all my heart, telling her that this was a mistake...and...and, she may not believe me but I will try to explain the situation to her, and-</p>
<p class="null-p">"-"</p>
<p class="null-p">A soundless shock escaped from my mouth. Why? I even made sure to get off with the timing where she could not possibly make it in time to come after me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Announcement: the emergency stop button of the platform has been pressed, and we will depart once we confirm the safety of the passengers. I repeat: the emergency stop button of the platform has been pressed, and we will depart once we confirm the safety of the passengers."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing the repeating announcement, I looked up at the speaker installed on the ceiling in pure shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">The warmth I felt on my back squeezed me even tighter. Her hands that I left to dangle emptily were wrapped tightly around my waist as if they would never let me go again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing her heartbroken cry almost shattered my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me, Riichi. Did I do something wrong? Did I make you angry? If so, I will apologise. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">No. That's not it, Natsumi. I am the one who needs to apologise, you did nothing wrong...so...so… "Don't let out such a miserable voice." Ah, this is impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">I just can't make myself to hurt her like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, you are too forceful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before I realised it, I had turned around and was squeezing her tightly. In order to heal the pain in my heart...in order to heal the sadness I caused her, even if temporarily.</p>
<p class="null-p">But..</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi. You see, I have something to tell you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But I shouldn't be doing this. At this rate...I'll fail again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because that would result in Natsumi confessing like this. And I would end up hearing that confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when that moment came to pass, I obtained my final confirmation.</p>
<p class="null-p">That it was really her confession, her "I love you" towards me, that ended up killing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That regardless of anything, that fact would stay unchanged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Safety on the platform has been confirmed and we will depart now. Please step behind the yellow line."</p>
<p class="null-p">Otherwise, this would not make sense, right? Why else would the train that started speeding up suddenly derail? Why would it roll Natsumi, who was supposed to be in my embrace, into the accident, as if to rob her from me!?</p>
<p class="null-p">That doesn't make sense!</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this situation!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did Natsumi...why only her!</p>
<p class="null-p">"AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">My sorrowful wails disappeared into the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">And my consciousness was cut shot.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, I woke up to the morning of December 22 for the sixth time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I slowly rose up, and instead of grabbing the camera I impulsively drove my fist into the desk. The pain gradually spread though my hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">WHY!?</p>
<p class="null-p">JUST WHY!?</p>
<p class="null-p">WHY THE FUCK IS THIS HAPPENING!!</p>
<p class="null-p">Punch! Punch! Punch!</p>
<p class="null-p">With every hit my anger grew stronger.</p>
<p class="null-p">Punch! Punch! Punch!</p>
<p class="null-p">Punch! Punch! Punch!</p>
<p class="null-p">Punch! Punch…</p>
<p class="null-p">Punch…</p>
<p class="null-p">When I finally lowered my fist, my head became so cold as if all the blood was drawn from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">After venting out my anger, all that remained was a cool-headed resolution. Now that I've reached the answer, I swore to never repeat it again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"One more time. This time, I won't let her confess no matter what happens."</p>
<p class="null-p">My oath was so contradictory it almost made me laugh. After all, I was trying to prevent the confession from the girl I loved. No matter how you thought about it, could you really call that anything but foolish?</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="null-p">Christmas Eve of the sixth loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I dashed through the street dyed in twilight colors.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you keep waiting for me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you look so happy!? Don't you realise what I did these past two days? I was cruel to you, hurt you, and even made you wait for so long today… Don't you realise that I betrayed you!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But you seemed to be suffering too, Riichi," She said with a smile. Hearing her words made me burst into tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's the matter with you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I should be the one asking that. Don't fucking act so familiar with her." "Tsk!" With a click of the tongue, that damn skirt-chaser left the place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, you are late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was cold, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said I was sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">She laughed happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for saving me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment I heard that, I could no longer endure it and pulled her in a tight embrace. Despite swearing that I would avoid this development.</p>
<p class="null-p">After waking up on December 22, I intentionally acted harshly towards her so she would come to hate me, and so she would just give up without confessing to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she asked me to eat lunch together, I refused with a click of the tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she came to chat, I coldly answered I was busy and left my seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she asked me to go home together, I told her I had stuff to do while acting displeased.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, I desperately tried to make her hate me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, too, I did not show up at our meet-up place on our agreed time and simply observed her as she kept waiting for me under the cold winter sky. I thought everything would be fine as long as she just gave up and went home.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Natsumi stubbornly refused to move from the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">While rubbing her cold hands and shrinking her shoulders from the cold wind, she kept waiting for hours and hours.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her like that was killing me on the inside, and when someone tried to pick her up, I finally lost it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, you are too forceful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Be quiet. Just stay like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why? Why are you giving me such an obedient nod? Wasn't I cruel to you, Natsumi? I did things that could easily let you fall out of love for me, you know? So, why…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you hugging me so happily."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why, you ask?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With a leak of a sigh, a faint smile floated on her face, and in the end, she still said those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she died. She was stabbed in the back by a slasher that came out of nowhere. As the surroundings slowly fell into chaos, I kept on hugging her body that grew colder every second with tears spilling down my face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Goddamnit, what should I do…</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus came the seventh Christmas Eve. I was lying on the bed while gazing emptily towards the corner</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since I woke up on the 22nd, I single-mindedly shut myself inside my room and never left. Even when I received a call from the school, I stubbornly refused to come out and stayed in bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was feeling an indescribable pain. But I did not know what else to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">I just have to wait for three days, just until the end of this loop interval. I have to keep distance from Natsumi and avoid her confession, and then…</p>
<p class="null-p">"This will finally...finally end…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I continued muttering those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sense of misery creeping into my heart was forcing me to hug my knees and curl into a ball on the bed. If I didn't squash myself like that, I felt like I would instead be crushed by the hopeless reality I was up against.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ringtone of my smartphone disturbed the mood. I reached out towards the low vibrating phone, and checking the display, there was "Natsumi" written on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A soundless scream escaped from my lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't the first one. The number of messages I received during the past two days piled up like snow, transmitting a silent coldness to my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This was really tasty!", "Let's visit it together next time, okay?", "Hey, listen, Riichi. Mom was so mean!", "I'm sleepyyy", "Look, look! What a cute kitty!".</p>
<p class="null-p">They were about such daily moments.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, are you okay?", "Are you feeling bad?", "Please tell me if there's anything I can do, okay?", "If there's something troubling you, talk to me. This Natsumi will take care of it!", "I'm worried about you." As well as words of concern towards my clearly suspicious conduct.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did I do something?", "I'm sorry. I'm probably bothering you with all these messages…", "Why won't you answer…", "Maybe I should call you…", "I want to talk to you, Riichi…".</p>
<p class="null-p">And her anxiety.</p>
<p class="null-p">The total amount of messages I received from her in these three days passed 50. My heart shook after each one I read, almost making me respond to her on the spot, but…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. Sorry, Natsumi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tearing up here was probably pointless. But that was all I could do. If I actually answered her, then no matter what happened, it would only lead to the future I was trying to avoid.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Ring-Ring. Ring-Ring. Ring-Ring.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of the interphone echoing through my silent room made my shoulders instinctively twitch. I stuck to pretending to be out and the ringing finally stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was the home delivery, they will probably come again tomorrow. That's what I thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Click!</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard the opening of a lock, and then…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi. You are there, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The one who casually opened the door to my room was my mother who was supposed to be at her parents' home.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you even have to ask. The school contacted me, saying you were skipping school without notice. And just as I arrived to see what was going on, I ran into her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I went ahead and asked anyway, but I already knew the answer to that. There was only one person who could possibly visit my room during the Christmas Eve…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, I came."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Natsumi. She anxiously peeked inside the room to answer my question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh you, why did you make your room such a mess. I'm sorry,</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no. It's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, take your time."</p>
<p class="null-p">With those words, she slammed the door shut and left, leaving me and Natsumi face-to-face. All I could do was stare at her with hazy eyes as she removed her red coat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry for coming without notice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did you come? I did something bad to you, you know? I even ignored your messages. So, why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I know you would not do something like that. Because I believe that the faithful Riichi I know would never do something like that without a good reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, Natsumi, why...why are you so…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kind to a fault…"</p>
<p class="null-p">My gloomy mutter revealed just how much I wanted to talk with her. If I did not desperately hold it in, I would definitely cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tell me, Riichi. What happened? Tell me. I'm sure I can help you." To her words, I could do nothing but shake my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither what was going on, nor what I had to do...I knew nothing...nothing at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay, Riichi. I will stay with you...so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body felt tiny in my embrace, yet it was warm without hope.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There, there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her repeating words were filled with kindness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Everything will be okay, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing her call my name filled me with supreme bliss and I failed to hold back my feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">And those words leaked out from my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Me too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I knew full well what they would bring…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with the overflowing happiness came that outcome.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-"</p>
<p class="null-p">And once again, Natsumi vomited blood and collapsed.</p>
<p class="null-p">While hugging her growingly limp body, I cursed the cruel world.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why...why!</p>
<p class="null-p">All I wished for was her love!</p>
<p class="null-p">Was fulfilling your love with the girl you loved something so bad!? ▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, I hate you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus came the eighth Christmas Eve. Those were the very first words I spoke the moment I arrived at our meet-up spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">I rejected her. At this point, that was all I could think of. I acted as usually the past two days, so If I suddenly said these words to her now, what face would she make, I wondered. What would she feel?</p>
<p class="null-p">Would she cry?</p>
<p class="null-p">Get angry?</p>
<p class="null-p">Or maybe, she would just leave without saying a word?</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no way she would confess to someone like-!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah...Ahhh-</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know what happened, but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, stop. Don't say it, Natsumi-</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way I would believe you when you tell me that with such a miserable expression."</p>
<p class="null-p">How...How can you be caressing my cheek so gently? Why are you looking at me as if you are about to cry?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, why…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, you are bad at lying. You are too sincere, kind and are unable to hurt others. So I could easily see through your lies."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is. Just as you've always been next to me, so was I. Otherwise, I would still be that same loner, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi...Natsumi...Natsumi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what the heck am I doing? Wasn't I trying to reject her just a second ago? Then why...why am I hugging her now?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, I just can't do it...I really do love you, in the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why...Why was I saying something like this? Despite knowing that she will once again…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Say those words to me…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">And I woke up. The morning of the December 22 greeted me with the usual coldness.</p>
<p class="null-p">And this marked the ninth time I saw this scenery. Whatever I do it never works, I was assaulted by such, almost empty, sense of hopelessness.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had to force Natsumi not to confess.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was all I had to do, and yet...something so simple turned out to be so, so hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because I've repeated this for so many times, I already stopped feeling anything about the refreshing winter morning. I got ready for school with almost mechanical movements and opened my door, about to head out, when...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kya!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard quite a cute voice and looked up, and there was a girl fallen on her backside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, my bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that she was walking in the hallway just as I opened the door. I held my hand out to her and she obediently grasped it with her tiny one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes. Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Just as I took a proper look at this brightly smiling girl, I opened my eyes wide in shock at how peculiar she looked.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked quite snug in her hooded jacket, and even her height barely reached up to my chest. She had good looks, but didn't seem to be from my generation, so probably a middle schooler. But all those were trivial. What caught my eye was her hair and eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hair was such a pure white that I wondered whether it was completely colorless, and her eyes were such a vivid fluorescent blue that I also wondered whether they were made to be contrastive to her hair. I was fixated so much on that pure colour I thought they were going to suck me in.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umm…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It seems she found it weird that I just stood and kept holding her hand, she looked up at me with an innocent gesture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">I released her hand in a hurry and was about to walk away, when…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please hold out just one more time!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt like I heard that voice, but when I turned around the white-haired girl was already running in the hallway with her back on me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did someone like that actually live in this apartment?"</p>
<p class="null-p">With that doubt in my head, I continued my way towards the school. My every step felt heavy and full of hopelessness.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, whether I shut myself inside or not, Natsumi would still come to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. Did you wait long?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And, on the ninth Christmas Eve, Natsumi showed up at the usual place in the usual clothes. A red coat that I got too used to seeing, and matching clothes she probably gave a lot of thinking to for this special day. No matter how many times I repeat this, I still find her beaming smile charming.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those clothes really do suit you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why would I lie about something like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahah."</p>
<p class="null-p">When I saw her laugh so blissfully, I thought to myself, Just what did she do to deserve this? Why she...only she...had to keep dying?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go already, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I stop?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it makes me happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Just walking hand in hand with her like this made me indescribably happy. Regardless of how many times I repeated this, my heart still throbbed as lively as ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look, look! Aren't these clothes cute?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, you are right. They would fit you perfectly, don't you think?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh, you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure of it. Wanna try it on a bit?" Having a casual talk...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, let me have a bite."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Can you feed me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Asking to be pampered…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey Riichi. It's fun, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that I could spend this time with her was filling me with utmost happiness. That's why…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't think we would really manage to sneak in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Someone actually forgot to lock it. Lucky for us."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, I was feeling so settled on the inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder how long was it since the last time we snuck into the deserted school and crawled up to the rooftop. The dazzling streets, even the Abies Tower waiting to be lit up… the world shrouded in silence was sparkling like never before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Natsumi. Do you remember? The time we met for the first time." "Yeah, I do. Rather, I would never forget something so important."</p>
<p class="null-p">Winter's cold wind blew. Its coldness made us curl up and draw closer to each other without any particular order, and we started conversing softly, in almost whispers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure was amusing. I was here offering you a hand, but you were stubbornly refusing it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's… You were a totally unfamiliar boy, so I was scared to hold your hand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really were like a hedgehog. Being unsociable and all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I can say the same about you. You were strangely distant yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? Though I doubt I was on your level."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enough with that talk already."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her pout made me feel unimaginably sad. A little more and she would, once again, utter those very words...and then…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Riichi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing, don't worry about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment, I realised something. When I thought back to Natsumi's death scene, there was a part of me that had already accepted it as a natural outcome.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, it was a terrible shock. I had been faced with an inescapable reality where nothing changed no matter how many times I repeated it, and the pain lanced through my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">That pain had vanished now, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite how all-encompassing it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite the absolute despair it left me in.</p>
<p class="null-p">Despite all that, there was a part of me, deep in my heart, that had accepted it.</p>
<p class="null-p">-I see. It seems I have long since exceeded my limits, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, let's go somewhere a bit higher."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, sure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Be sure to hold my hand properly this time, okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fine already, geez."</p>
<p class="null-p">We climbed up on top of the pile trash while joking around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yakisoba", "Okonomiyaki", "Red Team", "Score Board". Among such signboards, there were some with their nails sticking out due to rough treatment. It took us quite some trouble to tread on carefully so as not to step on any of them, but it was nothing compared to the view we got in exchange as we arrived at the top.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It truly is."</p>
<p class="null-p">We were a level above even the rooftop. The look from here showed us an even bigger part of Misono than before. Light seemed to be sucked up from the residential area centered around the Abies Tower, as if the stars were being sent towards the night sky. Its faint light illuminated my weary heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before we noticed we were sitting atop the signboards and leaning against each other in silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">This gentle silence almost seemed like it didn't wish to part with us.</p>
<p class="null-p">My hand on top of hers seemed like it was gathering courage for what was to come.</p>
<p class="null-p">The transmitted warmth strengthened my resolve bit by bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">While calling her name, I apologised in my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, for her to make such an anxious expression...just how am I looking at her now, I wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Face towards me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sorry. Sorry, Natsumi. I'll apologise, so please, forgive me.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I touched her cheek, as if trying to wipe my own inner tears, it had gotten so cold that I ended up covering them with both of my hands, but...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, turns out my hands are cold too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not the c-mph!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A faint sigh escaped through her nose. The sensation stirred up my heart and I pressed my lips even stronger. And without stopping, I gently laid down her body on top of the worn out signboards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking down at her, she seemed to have sensed something and was looking back at me wide-eyed, but in the end, she gave me a big nod with a flushed face. Ended up nodding, rather.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...It's okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her delicate and frail voice made my suppressed carnal desires burst. Comprehending what I was about to do, the stimulation sent shivers down my spine. And then, I apologised to her once more…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mph!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet contrary to my violent desires my kiss was gentle so that I would not hurt her. And then, I pressed my body on top of her, and…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah-, khah-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Gently and affectionately, I put my hands on her neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ri..ichi…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are...you...cry...ing…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, Natsumi. I am crying.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know what to do anymore...I feel miserable, lonely and completely lost. Why was I doing something like this? I never intended it at all. But I've had enough of it. Of seeing Natsumi dying a senseless death. However many times I repeat, I end up seeing her death. Tell me, just what the hell is going on? Just...Just leave us be…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm at my limit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">My heart was already in tatters. I knew neither what I was doing nor what I had to do. All I wanted was to be by her side, to spend fun days with her...so why was I doing something like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">Aaah, I've really lost it now.</p>
<p class="null-p">But...But this might be a possibility, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">If I kill Natsumi and then myself, maybe we can escape this loop?</p>
<p class="null-p">This is the only hope I have left…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ri...i...chi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...It's okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you. I gave her another gentle kiss for saying those words. Even as my love for her spilled out from me, my hands didn't loosen the grip. Instead, I gripped tighter and tighter, in proportion to how my feelings strengthened during all these repeats.</p>
<p class="null-p">I love you, Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">I love you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, forgive me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Listen, Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">My heart cannot stop it anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, please let me leave them here.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I do that, then I can keep doing my best again.</p>
<p class="null-p">If this method doesn't work, I'll try even harder next time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I will do my best to avoid your confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">So…</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I wonder how long I've been in that position. I kept strangling her neck, driven by the feelings of apology and conviction, and when I finally came to my senses, she was no longer uttering a single word.</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">So...my job here was done.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was time for me to follow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"See you later."</p>
<p class="null-p">With those words, I jumped down from the roof. As I was falling headfirst, I caught sight of the Abies Tower being lit up. Haha, seeing it alone is quite pointless.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, before I could even hear the dull sound of impact, I lost my consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">When I opened my eyes, it was still the 22nd and I had returned. That realisation filled me with a dull sense of despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what the hell am I doing?</p>
<p class="null-p">I was full of such helplessness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Really, just what am I doing?</p>
<p class="null-p">"... It's okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah...AAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHH!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not want that!</p>
<p class="null-p">I never intended that!</p>
<p class="null-p">I never intended to do that, yet…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I killed Natsumi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I strangled her...with these hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">But...but I couldn't help it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was at my limit…everything I did was useless…but I did not want to see her die...so I decided…it was better to…kill her with my own hands and die with her… but...why…</p>
<p class="null-p">why…</p>
<p class="null-p">why did I… "Why!?" FUCK! FUCK!</p>
<p class="null-p">What the fuck is this! What the fuck is going on!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Again!? Do I have to go through this again!?</p>
<p class="null-p">If today is 22nd again, I have to start over again, don't I!?</p>
<p class="null-p">And I have to once again hear her confession on the Eve and watch her die!?</p>
<p class="null-p">This…</p>
<p class="null-p">This is madness…</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how many more times do I have to go through this…</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, maybe I should just give up…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words leaked out of my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">I absentmindedly rose myself and walked towards the desk like a ghost, grabbing scissors from the pencil pot. I wasn't thinking at all. With natural movements, I pointed its tip towards my throat, and…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Came a sharp voice, and along with it, an impact. I hit my head on the floor during the fall. While I was seeing stars, I could feel the scissors being snatched away from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haah...haah… what do you think you are doing!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I opened my eyes there stood a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hair white like snow. Fluorescent blue eyes that stood out even in this dim room. There was no doubt. It was the same girl I met at the entrance during the last loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you."</p>
<p class="null-p">My voice sounded so deep even I was surprised. It was so devoid of emotions it made the girl twitch. Haha, did I sound so scary?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, tell me," my sharp voice shook the atmosphere. With those words as a start, my emotions swelled up…"what is this? What the hell is going on? Why do I have to go through this over and over and over...come on...please, tell me what the hell is going on!!!" Before I noticed, I was grasping the girl by her collar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand anything! What the hell is going on!? Why did Natsumi have to die so many times!? Why did I have to go through this so many times!? Why kind of situation is this!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I stared down at her while breathing wildly, she looked up at me with a face on the verge of tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with that face? It's you, isn't it? You are making me go through this, aren't you!? Then why...why are you looking at me like that!? Answer me!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, what am I doing. A voice from some calmer part of my head addressed me. What was I trying to achieve by getting violent on this girl?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the girl wasn't scared by my threatening attitude and, after looking down for a moment, she looked back up with a determined expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How many times is it now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That single sentence made me certain. This girl knew that I was going through a loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like hell I know that. I don't remember it anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice carried with it a sense of dampness. She sounded as if it was really her fault that I was looping. My violent anger started to gradually die down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are amazing. You kept going until you became like this. You really are amazing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her clear voice resounded close to my ear. Filled with kindness to the utmost, it silently seeped into my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">She hugged me.</p>
<p class="null-p">As if to console me, she gently wrapped her arms around me and cuddled her cheeks to me. Her touch set free yet another emotion locked inside my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa…aah, hic..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waa...aaah..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after I thought about how pathetic I was, I started tearing up and I could no longer suppress my voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It must have been so painful. It must have been so hard. But it's okay now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her kind words loosened my heart. Day after day, I hopelessly wondered why I was going through...why did I have to repeat something so painful so many times.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was this happening only to me? Did I have to keep doing my best even when no one else understood me? Everything that weighed on me, everything I endured all this time had gushed out fromme.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwa...ahh… Ueh… Aah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">I buried my face in her shoulder as she gently patted my back. All this time, I wished to lean on someone like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was continuing to loop, only the fatigue kept accumulating in my heart and I felt helpless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing I did bore fruit, however I tried it only lead to a dead end.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/boku-to-kimi-dake-ni_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Only sad and painful memories kept piling up day after day, and I was on the verge of collapsing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She held me without saying a word.</p>
<p class="null-p">Me, someone who killed Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">This gentle sense of relief made me want to brazenly entrust my whole body to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this time did not last forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">A faint vibration reverberated through the room. It was the sound of my smartphone that I threw on the bed. And on its screen was one word - "Natsumi".</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment I saw that, I hugged the girls waist in fright.</p>
<p class="null-p">I can't do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I… Just what kind of face should I make when I meet Natsumi? She would certainly not be aware of what I did. But I do.</p>
<p class="null-p">I remember the slenderness of her neck and how I strangled it.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, how was I supposed to meet her!?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't…" a weak mutter escaped my lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">The smartphone keep on vibrating as if urging me on.</p>
<p class="null-p">While I was in that state, the girl gently pulled herself away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she separated from me, I felt assaulted by a sense of loneliness akin to abandonment. I looked at her, who was staring straight at me, with imploring look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please meet Natsumi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was so cruel. I urged her to tell me why was she asking something so harsh from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From now on, I will be with you too. So, please, meet Natsumi-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please don't run away from your feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was overpowered by her appealing words and the urging brilliance in her eyes, and I picked up the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Riichi? Where are you now? The first period is about to start."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was momentarily overcome with various emotions and lost my</p>
<p class="null-p">words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the reason I managed to call her name was thanks to this girl who was embracing my back. Her hands that kindly rubbed my back gave me just enough courage to squeeze out my voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Sorry. I'm not coming to school today. Let's meet...tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">After barely managing to convey that, I cut the call without waiting for her answer. And then, I heaved a big sigh. That was just how big a burden was placed on my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what I expected from you, Richi-san. Good boy, good boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">The way she confronted me like a mother to her child made me want to cling to her. I wanted to shamelessly bawl my eyes out and entrust my weakened heart to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who are you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, after hearing Natsumi's voice, I managed to stop myself on the verge of it and managed to pose my question. Hearing it, she beamed me an enchanting, sweet smile and answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Rinka. In order to save you two, I came from the future."</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay. Everyone has days where they want to skip school. Just make sure you go tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, true."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, I felt too afraid to face my sin of killing Natsumi and couldn't go to school today. I secluded myself inside my room and continued talking with Rinka, and the day was already nearing its end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, if it's possible, please properly show your face to Natsumi tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">I said that, but in the end, I still wondered whether I was qualified to meet her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, now that I've looped, Natsumi would not know what I did. But, even if that's the case, I can't just pretend that never happened, I'm not allowed to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you feel guilty towards Natsumi-san, then make sure you get out of this loop, Riichi-san. Please make sure she doesn't die any more than this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice resounded heavily in the room filled with the rays of the setting sun. Her words were exactly on point, and exactly why they sounded so unforgiving. It was as if she was telling me not to run away from reality, and honestly speaking, I still didn't have enough willpower in me to accept her heavy words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's so tiresome…"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why my mutters sunk painfully low, as if invited by the shadows created by the setting sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">In truth, I wanted to get out of the loop this very second.</p>
<p class="null-p">How could I attain the future that I failed to reach even at the cost of killing Natsumi? Was it really possible at all?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand. Can I...really escape this loop…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't the same as when I lashed out at Rinka this morning. This was my honest question after crossing all my limits.</p>
<p class="null-p">Call me a coward, I'm fine with that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rebuke me for whining so much, I won't complain.</p>
<p class="null-p">I just...really didn't know.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Does the way to escape this loop really exist...?" I tried everything I could.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hurt Natsumi, betrayed her, and scorned her. I tried different places, different methods, but I still failed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I even killed Natsumi, you know…? I killed her so she would not die, and yet…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything was no bueno.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed. You were driven to the wall to that point, and yet you still haven't found a way out. But that's exactly why I am here. It's because the situation has reached this point that I can finally become your ally."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I asked that, Rinka, who sat in a refined manner, opened her mouth with a serious look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san. What was your thought when you saw my hair and eyes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, you ask…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not normal. It's strange - something along those lines, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, everyone would think that when they see such white hair and blue eyes. But…</p>
<p class="null-p">"The fact that you didn't straight up call it weird is the proof of your kindness. That kindness of yours was what saved Natsumi-san, you know? You are truly a wonderful person."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not someone so praiseworthy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">If I really was so kind, I would not have done something like that to Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san. I don't know how you think of yourself, but please don't depreciate yourself. You did everything you could for Natsumi-san all this time. Even after hurting her so many times at the cost of deceiving your own heart, you never stopped thinking about her and kept trying your best. Calling someone like that unkind would be a lie."</p>
<p class="null-p">My chest felt hot. Behind my tightly shut lips, my teeth started to tremble. Tears were about to fall from my downcast eyes. I see, so that's how it is. Rinka, you…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you saying that what I did was not a mistake…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I asked her with trembling voice…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">She returned an honest nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">With those words, I heaved a deep sigh. It was made intentionally intense, filled with my varied emotions. Because of that, because I exhaled everything I couldn't put into words, I was able to regain a bit of my willpower to face forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, would you believe me if I told you my hair and eyes were originally black?"</p>
<p class="null-p">And since I managed to do that, my mind was able to focus on my conversation with Rinka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I certainly did think that they weren't natural, but if so, why are they like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's because I traveled through time."</p>
<p class="null-p">That said, I still wasn't able to fully process those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Time travelled… then, that means you weren't joking when you said those words this morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When she said she came from the future, I didn't believe it at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sure are doubtful when it counts. Well then, here's my proof. This is my student ID that proves my social position in the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">With those words, Rinka pulled out a terminal from her pocket, and as she operated it an image was projected in the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Due to protecting personal information, my name, address and such are encrypted, but well, those aren't important to the current you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She added that, but honestly, the scene I was seeing made the word "Future" float in my head. Like, it was being projected in the air, you know? It wasn't projected on things like a wall or the ceiling like with projectors and 3d mappings, but in mid air, and in crazy high definition at that. And Rinka on the picture it displayed…</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you really did have black hair."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I was aware that time traveling would cause some kind of change in my appearance, but I never expected it to be this much. Oh well, it can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">She dismissed it like it was nothing, but she clearly seemed to be even younger than me. And since a girl that young was dismissing a change so big so easily, it meant that she had a good reason for doing so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rinka, just what is your objective?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is to protect the future of year 2039."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words that sounded like a joke carried such heaviness that you wouldn't be able to laugh them off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, there are many things we have to talk about, but before that,</p>
<p class="null-p">Riichi-san. How much do you understand about this loop?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you ask me, I don't know anything about it, be it the cause or the countermeasure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, there should be things that you have noticed after all those repeats. Please tell me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being stared at by those fluorescent blue eyes made my tension grow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What I noticed, huh… Well, there are two things. Those are, Natsumi's death causes the loop and Natsumi always dies after she confesses."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right… that's why I tried to avoid her confession in different ways. They ultimately all failed, though. Hmm? Wait, in that case…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is the fact that Natsumi's confession is unavoidable also included in that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay, let's see. Your understanding is mostly right. But regarding that last point, you should've confirmed it yourself in the last loop that it's not absolutely impossible to avoid her confession." ...Oh, right.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I created a situation where she physically could not talk, then she naturally wouldn't be able to confess. Still, she sure is merciless with her words to tell me that upfront.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, you aren't suggesting that I escape the loop by means of that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please be at ease. I have no intention of suggesting plans that employ such inhuman means. Even if I did, that would not let me protect the year 2039."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those words brought peace to my mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">Otherwise, if she suddenly said, "oh yes, that's the plan,' I would not know what to do anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, it's been on my mind all this time, but what exactly do you mean by protecting the year 2039? Is there some kind of enemy out there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I asked that, Rinka wordlessly stood up and walked to the window, opening it with a clatter and letting the winter's air flow into the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, how does this sky look for you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">My mind suddenly had a flashback.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of the rooftop post 4PM.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of the pile of scrap wood and the blue sky of spring.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, of the picture of a girl with a smartphone in hand, enveloped by the pink-colored sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sky is being invaded by an enemy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi of that time used to post various pictures and posts like that. But reflected in each and every one of those pictures was an ordinary sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">But for her-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it... Natsumi's...sky…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. It's the pale-pink sky that Natsumi-san sees. That is both the cause of your looping and the definite enemy of humanity in the year 2039."</p>
<p class="null-p">……</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your face is telling me you can't make heads or tails of what I said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was hard to believe that the cause of this ridiculous situation was in the sky, of all things. What the heck?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just thought that it would be better if it was some other, easier to understand enemy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though you are already as lost as you could possibly be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka stood before me, appearing so vivid that it stimulated my mind. I felt as if the cold room became even colder by a few degrees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to be so on guard. I am your ally. Now-shall we finally talk then? About what is making you and Natsumi-san go through all this."</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"Both the reason for you getting stuck in a loop and Natsumi-san dying is up in this sky."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Rinka started her story. Her calm voice spread though the freezing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They are called Diva. They are not organic lifeforms like humans, but instead, data-based ones made up of particles of information."</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hold it for a bit. That's a bit too much information in one go. Diva?</p>
<p class="null-p">Data-based lifeform? Are you being serious?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm serious. There's nothing for me to gain by telling jokes to you now."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a point. But I couldn't so readily accept such a SF-like story.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka however ignored my confusion and continued her speech.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Diva had already sprung forth since 2010. However, there was no one who could notice them. Except Shiranamise Natsumi-san, that is."</p>
<p class="null-p">What did Natsumi have to do with this. Why did she show up in this crazy story…? I was so dumbfounded all I could do was nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've seen them too, right, Riichi-san? Those pictures she uploaded on SNS and the attached texts. She was trying to report Diva's existence to other people though those pictures and words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sky is being invaded by an enemy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Could you imagine how hard it was to believe that those posts that couldn't be seen as anything but jokes were actually intended for such purpose?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see. Haven't you heard this from Natsumi-san? That her headache subsided when she put the headphones on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"She did, but what about it…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is also the proof that she can perceive Diva."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she was telling me that so confidently, I couldn't possibly understand what she meant. Sure, Natsumi was using her headphones, but so what?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi-san has synesthesia. It's when people give colors to sounds and letters, have you heard of it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I don't think I have. So, assuming she has that, what does that change?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"When Diva exchange information it transmits a peculiar sound wave. It's a sound you usually wouldn't even be able to hear, but because of synesthesia, Natsumi-san is able to capture it as a color. A pale pink sky. She mentioned it to you before, didn't she?" It was far from mentioning it to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">The pale pink sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was what served as the trigger for us to exchange words. That sky she talked about was the cause of us becoming closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The sky that she saw are Diva. Most probably, she got those headaches during the moments they became active. And by using those highly soundproof headphones, she was able to soften it."</p>
<p class="null-p">If what she said was true, then I could see why drinking medicine would be useless. There didn't exist a doctor who would be able to treat such nonsensical cause, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi-san is being killed by that Diva."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait. Why did it suddenly come to her being killed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because, In the future of 2039, Shiranamise Natsumi would develop the means of opposing Diva that are threatening humanity."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh, what?"</p>
<p class="null-p">What? What did she just say?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can understand your shock. However, that is the reality for us. She will develop several technologies in the future. She was naturally connected to observing Diva, but it was also her who discovered the one and only means of opposition that we have against them-the "Interception Barrier Program". In the near future, she would accomplish achievements that would be carved in history."</p>
<p class="null-p">The mood of the deathly silent room hurt my ears. What should I feel when hearing all that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Future.</p>
<p class="null-p">Diva.</p>
<p class="null-p">Year 2039.</p>
<p class="null-p">The "Interception Barrier Program".</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't know where to even begin to wrap my head around it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And as such, Diva found her existence unpleasant. They then started to synchronize with the past. Naturally, their objective was to eliminate Natsumi-san. When we noticed that, we also worked out a plan to follow it into the past and protect her. And that's where I come from. I came from 2039 to protect Natsumi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">A lie...it didn't seem to be. It didn't appear that way, and assuming it was, there was no use in doing so. Well, it would be a different story if Rinka's head was filled with cringy fantasies.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'd like to delve deeper regarding Diva and the future, but for now, just let me hear all you have to say. Honestly, with only what you told me, I can't understand what's happening now. Why am I looping? Are Diva doing this too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, what was important now was not complicated things such as what was happening in the future. What I wanted to know was how to get out of this loop, nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Unfortunately the cause of looping are not Diva. I was the one who created it in order to protect you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-!? Then are you saying it can be dealt with!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I asked back in excitement, but Rinka slowly shook her head sideways, quite insentiently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As long as the conditions aren't met, it will never be released."</p>
<p class="null-p">Damn it. And here I thought I could finally be free from this madness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, is the requirement that? Not letting Natsumi confess to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It's as you say. It is to roll over the 24th December without Natsumi-san confessing to you. That is the only way to get out of this loop."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was more or less how I expected it to be. During all the previous loops, I always tried to avoid Natsumi's confession. In other words,</p>
<p class="null-p">"What I was trying to do was not a mistake. But, isn't it weird? Why are</p>
<p class="null-p">Diva targeting the moment she confesses to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right. That was the strangest part in all this. Why was Natsumi always dying after the confession?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because that would mean Natsumi-san gaining a supporter - you. As I mentioned before, Natsumi-san developed the system to fight Diva in the future. And you always stood by her side. Whenever she felt discouraged or disheartened, you always held her close and cheered her up. That's why, from the point of view of me who came from the future, you are an even more important existence than her in a way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean? It was Natsumi who developed the "Interception Barrier Program", not me, right? Then why are you speaking with such implications?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because, in this time period, you are her only supporter. And it would continue to be that way for years to come. It took us until the year 2030 to finally perceive Diva's existence. Until then, Natsumi-san continued living isolated in a world where no one understood her." ...What?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you serious? You mean she would stay as lonely as she is now?" If so, I can't just shrug it off as nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It's sad but it's the truth. Still, even as she was not being understood, she still continued her research on Diva, and just before they swallowed humanity, she made their existence known and established the means of opposing them. Those were all Natsumisan's achievements, but your existence is indispensable for them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rinka, you really aren't joking right now, are you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I could show you the proof of just how important an existence you are, but doing so would fall under the banned actions of the upstream time travel..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka started pondering with those words, but honestly, I don't think I would be able to easily believe it even after seeing that proof. I mean, when someone suddenly appears and tells you, "you are a really important person for the future" you can't just swallow those words like nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, but I can only ask you to trust me on that. And so, another turning point is the day after tomorrow, the 24th December. That's when Natsumi-san confesses to you. And Diva also know this. And this is what they think: Shiranamise Natsumi was able to complete the "Interception Barrier Program" because she had you supporting her through every step of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you exaggerating it a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if you say that, that outcome has been proven in 2039. If this year you and Natsumi-san become a couple, that would mean humanity of 2039 will not be taken over by Diva, but if not, then they will be."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if you tell me that the future lies on my shoulders, just what do you expect me to do?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then why aren't Diva trying to kill either of us right this instant?</p>
<p class="null-p">Wouldn't that be faster instead of waiting for the confession?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's simple. Even if Diva killed you now, that would only make</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi-san seek revenge against them. And in case you two part ways, then it would be the ideal situation for Diva, as Natsumi-san would decide to bare her fangs against humanity along with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">After saying all that, she paused and took a deep breath, and asked in a shaking voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Do you… believe me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her serious expression was nowhere to be seen now. Instead, it was replaced by a look of unsease directed at me. Well, that was only natural. Even me, were I not involved in it, would find it unbelievable if someone told me all that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I was already involved.</p>
<p class="null-p">The proof of that was painfully carved into my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">The repeating confession and death.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking about all the times I was made to see those, her story doesn't seem so unbelievable anymore. And above all, a single path finally opened up in a blind alley I was following until now. In that case, it wouldn't hurt to believe her words, would it?</p>
<p class="null-p">I took a deep breath. And then, I opened my mouth to announce my decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I believe you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't even describe how happy she looked to hear those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes shone, with her hands pressed to her chest in a praying position.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm so glad you believe me. If I were to be honest, I wouldn't have believed it if someone suddenly told me all that. You are quite generous, Riichi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You…are indirectly telling me that I'm a dumbass, aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No such thing. Why would I ever think that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You've been spouting off quite a few rude remarks even before this."</p>
<p class="null-p">She puffed her cheeks in an upset manner. Seeing her like that made me realise once again that she was younger than me, but she was still quite hard to grasp.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see… Diva, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It all sounded so unreal. Even after I heard all that, just what could I possibly do now?</p>
<p class="null-p">Diva, these mysterious existences, are killing Natsumi...what can I do against them?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I would also like to hear your story."</p>
<p class="null-p">"My story?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please tell me what you felt as you kept trying your best all this time. How hard was it, and what crazy things did you do during all this time?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying those words, she closed the window and walked away from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She then approached the bed, turned over the bed cover and sat on one side.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come sit next to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This room is too chilly. If we don't get under the covers, we'll catch a cold, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you are the one who opened the window in winter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's not go there," she answered indifferently. I sat down next to her as instructed, and she put the covers on my shoulders. "Hehe, it feels quite warm with the two of us inside."</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Being wrapped in the same blanket made me feel her warmth coming from right next to me. This morning it was still find since I was overcome with emotions, but it was a different story now, and I couldn't calm down with her sitting so close to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt a weight on my shoulder. Rinka had leaned her head against it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her conduct made it hard to grasp the sense of distance between us. But at the same time, I also felt my mind calming down with her cuddling so close to me. The heaviness in my heart started to soften.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...This situation is full of things that I can't understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just as Natsumi confessed to me, she died, or so I thought, but then time got rewound. At first, I thought I was going insane. It was hard to believe that something straight out of SF like time travel could be happening in real life."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then I started talking. About all that has happened, and what it took to reach this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I tried many things. I was trying to find a way to get out of this situation. But it was all useless. Even if I tried to keep my distance from her, even if I tried to get her to hate me, in the end, Natsumi still confessed to me, and still died...over...and over…" It was painful.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was tiring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being shown the dead body of a girl I loved over and over put me on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time I opened my eyes again, the realisation that I would be arriving at that unavoidable outcome wore down my mind and heart, and in the last few loops, I wasn't even able to eat properly anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I felt truly helpless. I was scared to even leave my room. I didn't feel like doing anything, but each time, Natsumi appeared before me and died…"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a nightmare.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was like a living hell.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that whatever I did still ultimately lead to her death even made me lose my will to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when it came to the pictures I used to take daily, I feel like I haven't taken any during the last few loops. Before this, I had my camera in hand whenever I found time, but I lost the drive to even do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather than devoting myself to my hobbies, I was wearing down my heart though all these nightmarish repeats.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's how I was all this time, so it made me awfully glad when you showed up, Rinka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Is that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. You stopped me when I was about to kill myself, faced my anger, hugged me and let me cry in your arms. Letting out everything I was holding in for so long lifted a heavy burden from me. Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How should I put it, seeing you thank me so honesty is making me feel embarrassed. But, I'm glad. That I was able to bring your energy back."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka entrusted her body to me even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because I felt her warmth, I could feel my eyelids loosen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which reminds me, I feel like I haven't slept for so long.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel so tired…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay, rest. I will be by your side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I...see…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, I feel at ease.</p>
<p class="null-p">Had closing your eyes always felt this good?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sleep well, Riichi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">As my consciousness gradually faded, I felt someone's gentle voice in my mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"That scared me…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I opened my eyes, I saw Rinka's pretty face before me.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had her pretty eyes closed and was in a deep sleep, her face revealing the innocence appropriate of a girl her age.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, I'm a bit lost here. Why is she sleeping right next to me?</p>
<p class="null-p">I quickly rose up to check my surroundings, which revealed that I was in my familiar room. Which meant...</p>
<p class="null-p">"So she fell asleep in that posture, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">I finally got a long needed rest yesterday. Even so, I'm not sure what to think of sleeping under the same blanket with a girl her age until morning…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mmm...cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I woke up and left the blanket open, Rinka started to stir in bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was hurriedly trying to put the blanket back on her, Rinka suddenly woke up and our eyes met.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mm, a bit longer…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wh-, Hey!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I hurriedly held her as she tried to snuggle back in, still half-asleep. Her warmth and fragrance, different from Natsumi, made my feel hot all over. I mean, what should I do in this situation?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Daddy…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do I look like I'm your daddy!? Come on, wake up already!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka continued muttering indistinguishable words as I tried to shake her awake. I didn't want to get any more rough, so I kept that up for some time and then, her eyes suddenly opened wide as if a switch had been flipped.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, there we go. Good morning?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...A...Ah…"</p>
<p class="null-p">I suppose this is what they mean when they say jaw-dropping. Rinka started trembling and then instantly shot up from bed with a beet red face and rushed towards the washroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">...Now then, how should I deal with this awkward mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please forget it please forget it. Please forget it once more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I got it. I got it already, so just calm down and let's eat."</p>
<p class="null-p">After all that confusion settled down, the two of us decided to have breakfast.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh god, that was the blunder of my lifetime. I can't believe I showed you that messy state of mine."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cool your head and let's just focus on eating for now."</p>
<p class="null-p">We've been like this for some time now. It seems that showing her sleepy face to me was too embarrassing for her, as she's been avoiding eye contact ever since we sat down to eat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"For what!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need to snap at me. I mean, for staying with me last night. I'm honestly grateful for it. I managed to get a good night's sleep for the first time in a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">When I honestly thanked her, her face turned beet red from embarrassment. Rather, so she can act shy and embarrassed too huh. She looks cute like that though.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't have to thank me. This is my duty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say something so sad. Listen, I'll be going to school today, but let's have a talk once I'm back. About the things we have to do from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright."</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, are you sure you are alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As was expected, I came across the worried Natsumi the moment I arrived at school. But that couldn't be helped. After all, I ended the call after a few words yesterday, and ignored the messages she sent to me afterwards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry to have worried you. I'm fine now."</p>
<p class="null-p">True to my words, my sanity had recovered so much it even surprised me. I thought the feelings of guilt would be weighing on me far more than this.</p>
<p class="null-p">That too was due to Rinka's help.</p>
<p class="null-p">She accepted both my anger and sorrow and even told me the cause of the situation I was in. She managed to-albeit not completely- blow away the feeling of hopelessness that I was feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, your complexion does look good"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right? So there's nothing to worry about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You properly came to school even on the national holiday, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pretty much."</p>
<p class="null-p">But now that I had more or less cheered up, I felt a bit different about pretending the previous loop never happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was a fact that I had killed her. That was something I wasn't allowed to forget.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's make the best out of tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">But, even so, it wouldn't make sense to apologise to current Natsumi about it. Apologising here would be easy. But in the end, that would be nothing but self-satisfaction. From her point of view, there was no reason for me to apologise. That's why, that was not the answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yup. I'm looking forward to it. I hope it will be sunny."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, me too."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, since I couldn't make up for what I did to the Natsumi of that time, I had to make up for it by making this Natsumi before me happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">That is my duty as someone who had, for one time, killed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">After school, me and Rinka sat facing each other in my room just like yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought this yesterday too, but this sure is a messy room."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mind your own business."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You aren't thinking of inviting Natsumi-san here, right? She'll end up hating you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh shut it. Leave me alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">While giving me an exasperated look, Rinka sat on my bed. I took a chair opposite from her and sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From yesterday's conversation, I understood a few things about the cause. So next is how to deal with it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You sound quite positive."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the situation now is better than all those previous times where I was diving blindly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what are you going to do? Do you have anything up your sleeve?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her scornful gaze hurt me. I mean, even if you look at me like that, I can't help it. Rather, is there anyone who could've come up with a solution so quickly after hearing all that yesterday?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll just keep on repeating as many times as it takes. That's the only thing I can do, and fortunately, I have infinite time as long as I keep repeating it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Despite the fact that Natsumi-san would die each of those times?" When Rinka asked that, I thought back to that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Confession and fresh blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Happiness and despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">A warm smile and a coat drenched in blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indeed, if I can be saved from seeing that again, than I would gladly do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl I love was dying before my eyes. Just about anyone would think that. However…</p>
<p class="null-p">"If that is connected to the future where Natsumi lives, then yes, that is the responsibility that I have to bear no matter what."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. I will cooperate as much as I can."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That helps."</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow, I felt the weight on my shoulders lighten a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">I've been doing this all by myself until now. But from now on, I finally had an ally.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The question is, how to make Natsumi not confess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that's not just for 24th December, but even after that too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. So even if Natsumi doesn't confess on Christmas Eve, but a day later, Diva would still kill her, huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that's how it is. That's why you have to create a situation where she would not confess to you not just tomorrow, but in the future too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like the degree of difficulty suddenly skyrocketed." In fact, I had not the slightest idea what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, I tried to get her to hate me before, but it, too, ended in a failure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I noticed Rinka silently staring at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was just thinking that you seemed awfully calm despite the talk being about avoiding a confession from the girl you love."</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh, so that's what it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, even if she doesn't confess to me, it's not like that would continue forever. You said it yesterday, right? That I would continue to be by her side from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I did but…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Naturally, it makes me sad. I love her, and she loves me too. Not being able to convey those feelings is draining. But...But, the time will come when we will be together, right? In that case, I'm willing to hang on for a bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. It's not like we will be separated by death. Compared to the outcome where one of us dies, being unable to confess for some time is nothing to be scared of.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. You are strong, Riichi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's not the case. She could say that because she didn't know the old me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not strong at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">I am miserable and lame. I cried over and over so pathetically, and even snapped at her. I'm your average weakling you could find anywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, what can I really do. I'll say this in advance, but no rejecting her okay? I don't wanna hurt her."</p>
<p class="null-p">The pain that would cause is already well known for me. Rather, I'm sure I won't be able to reject her. That's simply the extent of my love for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. Besides, even if you reject her, that itself would cause the future to be taken over by Diva. It's not something even I would welcome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Glad to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Which means, I have to think about what else I can do, huh.</p>
<p class="null-p">A method that wouldn't hurt her, yet would let me stay by her side without her confessing to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...There's only a single method like that, isn't there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"And what could that be?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is to get Natsumi to cooperate with us. I will tell everything I heard from you to her. If we get her to cooperate after that, that would solve everything, right? Even she should not confess if she knows that it would cause her death."</p>
<p class="null-p">As I proposed that, Rinka's expression remained grim. There was simply no other option, but was there something wrong with this?</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I understand. Then let's first try and see how that goes. Please tell her about Diva during your date tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, that's the plan. Still...looks like I can finally get out of this loop tomorrow."</p>
<p class="null-p">Imagining that made me awfully relaxed.</p>
<p class="null-p">I got caught up in something unbelievable. I was well aware of that fact. If you ask me whether I could handle it all, my answer would be a definite no.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, even so, I finally found the thread connected to the solution. And tomorrow, I would finally reach that solution.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt like I could finally see hope.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I suppose I'll prepare food for the evening. You should eat too, Rinka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. Thank you. But one more thing, Riichi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't be discouraged even if it fails, okay? Whatever happens,</p>
<p class="null-p">I will always be on your side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka sure was a worrywart. Tomorrow, all this will end. There will be no more loops.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, the fateful December 24th.</p>
<p class="null-p">As usual, I trolled the shopping district with Natsumi, doing some window-shopping and trying out various foods, and finally arrived at the school rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure is pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was already past 6PM. Even the Abies Tower seen afar was eagerly waiting to be lit up any moment now. I see, I never had a chance to see it before, but when this loop ends, I will finally be able to view it together with Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I never thought we'd manage to get to the rooftop."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We sure are lucky, huh. Ought to thank whoever forgot to lock the door."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing. You just seem kinda lively today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Though I said that, I was well aware of the reason for that. After all, I would be able to end everything right here. There would be no more time rewinds or loops. Surely, the next time I wake up, it will be the 25th of December, and I will head out to school while grumbling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, after I spend the remaining two short semesters with Natsumi, winter vacation will surely come and bring with it a lot of fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally ...finally! I will be free from this nonsense.</p>
<p class="null-p">But for that, I need to tell everything to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, I have something to tell you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it? Becoming so serious all of a sudden."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you remember the time we first met?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. There's no way I would ever forget that."</p>
<p class="null-p">As she firmly answered that, I could see some kind of longing desire in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sky is being invaded by an enemy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, stop it. That's embarrassing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike Natsumi, who started laughing bashfully, I continued talking with an extremely serious face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At first I also thought of it as a nonsense. Even if you told me it was being invaded by an enemy, I couldn't picture it at all. But Natsumi...I'm going to tell you something unbelievable now. But please. I want you to believe me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She probably sensed something unusual in my behaviour. I started explaining everything to her as she stood there quizzically. What Rinka told me yesterday, about the supernatural beings called Diva, about the year 2039, about us in that year, and about the loops.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first she looked dubiously at me, but in the end she started listening to me properly. She listened to my nonsensical and crazy speech to the end, without treating it as a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is all."</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time I was done the chilly wind uncomparable to the daytime made us cuddle our bodies together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Warm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's gentle body temperature made me remember.</p>
<p class="null-p">This heat belonged to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">This warmth belonged to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had been hugging her growingly cold body for so long I had completely forgotten how it felt. But now she was alive and she was here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...It was tough, wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it was."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The scale is so grand that I can't even begin to understand it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I didn't imagine the situation reaching this point." We secretly exchanged words.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not embarrassing or awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just a quiet and relaxing conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi. Have you ever wanted for a moment to last forever?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have thought that before. How joyous would it be if we could remain like this. But now, I can no longer think that way. I want to quickly reach the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">I will never forget the expression she had when she heard those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was forlorn and painful, as if frightened by the sin she was about to commit, and yet, in its depths, there was also delight blinking in and out of existence. It was a complicated expression with a mix of sorrow and joy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not minding my astonished expression, Natsumi spoke a single line.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know I...don't want to escape this loop."</p>
<p class="null-p">…</p>
<p class="null-p">……</p>
<p class="null-p">………</p>
<p class="null-p">My brain gave up on understanding those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we continue to loop permanently, then I can be with you forever. Come next year, our exams will finally get serious, and I was afraid that our careers would have separated us. But...you know, if we continued to loop like this, I can stay with you like this forever, right? In that case, why do we have to escape from such a blissful thing?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/boku-to-kimi-dake-ni_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Why are you...saying that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because, Natsumi, you are going to die. When you confess to me you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, Riichi. We can't do that. I just realised it, you know? I'm fine with dying. If we can be together like this for eternity, then something like dying is a trivial matter. So, Riichi-"</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm sorry, she murmured, and once again, spoke those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words, that repeated over and over like a curse, and continued to trap me in this cage of time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment I spoke those words, I heard something snap deep inside of me.</p>
<p class="null-p">I see, so this is how it feels to die.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's nothing like what I expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to how I imagined it, this is no big deal.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, I feel so happy right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hey, the me of next time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Be sure to confess again, okay?</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't hesitate, don't fear, and convey your feelings to Riichi.</p>
<p class="null-p">If you do that, I get to be with him forever and ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riichi is making a face like that for my sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, Riichi.</p>
<p class="null-p">You look so lovely right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">I love you.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">December 22.</p>
<p class="null-p">The smartphone screen that I grew to hate seeing. Throwing it to the bedside, I saw the same old ceiling. Even if I tried to see whether at least a dot of stain was added to it, there was no way I could find it…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha...haha. Hahaha…"</p>
<p class="null-p">A dry laughter, mixed with desperation, leaked from my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scream raised from my heart that grew to hate anything and everything started swirling inside the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please tell me this is a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's a lie, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">If it's not, what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, why did you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I covered my eyes with my arm, her face floated up in my dark vision.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had the finest smile… full of satisfaction, delight and happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">She smiled with a face I have never seen before, expressing how happy she was, and then vomited blood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as she fell on the cold roof, she had an expression that said there was nothing she regretted.</p>
<p class="null-p">The blood dripping from the raised corners of her mouth got burned into my eyes more than anything before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean you don't want to get out of this loop." Natsumi said she was happy to be caught in this loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">In this irrational, meaningless and hopeless suffering.</p>
<p class="null-p">This is too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just what I was trying so hard for all this time…!</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">For Natsumi, this loop is not misfortune but everything she desired.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand. What should I do now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was trying to get out of the loop because she was dying.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even that feeling was denied from me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Are you telling me to keep on looping like this?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ha...hahaha. Ahahahahahaha."</p>
<p class="null-p">This is so ridiculous it's unbearable. My heart screamed at this unreasonable situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I impulsively opened my curtains, the familiar townscape spread before my eyes. I couldn't even remember when was the last time I photographed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But strangely enough, when I checked my camera, the last photograph was apparently taken yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">December 21.</p>
<p class="null-p">Why, I wondered.</p>
<p class="null-p">There should've been so many pictures of today, December 22, that I took.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, I realized.</p>
<p class="null-p">The December 22nd had just started, and yesterday it was unmistakably the 21st.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ahh, this really has grown so strange.</p>
<p class="null-p">My perception had slipped off somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">While thinking about that, I clicked the shutter.</p>
<p class="null-p">One shot a day.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should have taken them in the previous loops too, but the one this time felt somewhat different from the rest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even in terms of the composition, exposure and focus.</p>
<p class="null-p">All of those were chaotically mingled together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it even worth taking a picture like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The picture I took was so bad I unconsciously spit out those words. It was so bad that, I'd rather never pick up the camera again if I was going to take a picture like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I suck at this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even those self-persuasive words had different emotions in them.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was too crude of a shot. I didn't even hold an image in mind and just snapped into the emptiness. It was by far the worst image among all that I have taken so far.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, I didn't even know what was the point in taking these pictures anymore. "Riichi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rinka, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seriously, just how does she manage to sneak in like this. Are you telling me there are tools to sneak inside houses in the future?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, um…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You saw it, right? You know about the last loop, right?" "...Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">She nodded with a pained expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, tell me. Isn't it laughable? Those were Natsumi's true feelings. She doesn't want to escape this loop. She believes repeating the same time forever to be happiness. What the hell is that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">My angry voice caused her to twitch. But I couldn't care less about that now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What the fuck was that!? What the fuck was I doing all this time!? I love her!? I didn't want her to die!? It turns out that was all meaningless in the end!!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, that's not the-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes it is! That's what Natsumi herself said. She said what I was doing was wrong. All of it was wrong. SHE said all that, you hear!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, calm down. Please calm down. I'm sure you are just confused now, so-"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So? So what!? Of course I'm confused. You thought I wasn't!? My feelings were crushed underfoot, and you tell me to be fucking calm!!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I trembled and breathed heavily. My ears were ringing like crazy, and my eyes felt like they were burning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sure Natsumi-san is also confused. She suddenly heard something so unbelievable, that's why she said something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, please just shut up. Or I, I…"</p>
<p class="null-p">But I couldn't say anything more. All those raging emotions of mine suddenly calmed down, as if washed by the waves. Instead, it was replaced by deep emptiness and hopelessness. Everything suddenly started to look ridiculous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fu...fufu...ahahahahahahahahaha!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I laughed like a madman. Even I couldn't understand my own emotions anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anger, sadness, emptiness, helplessness, and many other emotions all mixed together, and I couldn't help but laugh anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-, Riichi-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">While I was in that state, I swung my hand around. With a loud sound, all the books and pencils that were placed on the desk got scattered on the floor. When I was about to swing it once more, Rinka clung to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop. You should not treat those like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">What are you being so desperate for? Looking at what she meant, I saw the camera placed there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that camera something you should be treating so insignificantly!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Wasn't it what introduced you to Natsumi-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing those words, I lost all my power like an uncorked bottle. I powerlessly sank down to the floor, with Rinka doing the same beside me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Haha, what a disastrous scene…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to the worried-looking Rinka, I reached out my hand towards "that".</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is that…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's my pride."</p>
<p class="null-p">It fell on the floor along with the textbooks. It had such a bad fold that it opened up even if you didn't want it to.</p>
<p class="null-p">"First Place - Kuroe Riichi"</p>
<p class="null-p">Next to those words there was a single picture.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was my best shot in all my short photography career. It was a picture I could throw out my chest and call my masterpiece.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Her World"</p>
<p class="null-p">It depicted a single girl with those words engraved on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her spartphone was directed towards the sky, with a mountain of scrap wood under her feet and a slim tower in the background. With just that, it wouldn't have won this first place. But for some reason, everything but the girl in the center was dyed in a light-pink color.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only that much difference.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yet, it contained a sense of silence that couldn't be sensed normally. It was the kind of painful, encroaching silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that was the true nature of this picture. The loneliness a girl called Shiranamise Natsumi held inside moved the heart more than anything else, and at the same time, it looked beautiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">What I felt at that moment when I met hear at the rooftop was perfectly portrayed in this picture.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, you know, she was bullied in middle school."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh really?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Before I noticed I had started talking. Rinka didn't say anything and simply kept me company.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She saw the sky differently from other people, and it made her lonely. For that reason, she searched for someone like her… But, middle school is where kids are sensitive to unusual things, right? Just like that, Natsumi was singled out and became the target of bullying."</p>
<p class="null-p">Who knows how sad that felt. Alone, without being understood, she was called weird and ridiculed behind her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just by imagining what she felt at that time makes my heart tighten up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And that's probably why...when I first met her, she was fully alert like a hedgehog. She talked sharply and her sense of distance with people was bad, and she built walls around her."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was her way of dealing with life. She didn't know when she would taste sorrow again. Whatever she did, she could not find a like-minded person. In that case, wasn't it better to isolate herself from her surroundings from the start? That was the sad decision she had arrived at.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But even so, she could not endure being all alone like that. She made posts on SNS to find a comrade that might have existed somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sky is being invaded by an enemy." - she continued submitting such strange posts, endlessly so."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was always alone. She put on her large headphones and continued playing with her smartphone without saying a word to anyone, searching for someone who could understand her. She wanted to deny her loneliness and say that she wasn't alone in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And then, that Natsumi finally stopped being a loner. Perhaps that someone wasn't the kind of comrade she was looking for, but he reproduced the world she lived in with a camera and showed understanding."</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, when I showed her the picture, she made a truly happy expression. She could finally think that she wasn't alone in this world anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why...that's why it's not that strange for her to think like that… that she doesn't want to get out of this loop, and to live inside it forever in happiness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It does make sense though, doesn't it? She finally obtained a supporter. And she was finally able to say it. "I'm glad I met you, Riichi", "I'm happy to be like this". I easily let those pass, but those were actually something really precious to her, weren't they?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps...you are right."</p>
<p class="null-p">I patted her head as she cast her eyes down painfully. Thank you for making that face for Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, first, I believe I ought to accept her feelings."</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words spilled out from me quite naturally. Thinking back about</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi, I think those are her most precious-</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was interrupted by her sharp yell.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can't do that. If you accept her feelings, then what would happen from now on? Are you saying you are going to keep on looping like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right. Rinka, that's what makes you worried, huh. But, don't worry. Even I wouldn't accept that.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, my heart gets colder every time I loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">I became more and more lost and in the end even killed Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">I never want to do that again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. I will escape this loop no matter what. I love Natsumi, after all. I'd like to spend not just this limited time, but much, much more with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's right, I don't want to keep repeating like this, but instead, spend even more time with her. As if I can just sacrifice all of it without doing anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love Natsumi. And I want to live to the future with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was my selfishness. It may be something opposite of Natsumi's happiness. But...but that's exactly what I wish for. So..</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rinka, lend me your hand. So that I can advance into the future with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Of course I will. That's exactly why I am here."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was momentarily captivated by the commanding expression she showed. It didn't look like the one a kid like me would make, but instead, one of an adult with a duty to fulfil.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, please, resolve yourself. The method I'm about to suggest would keep both of you from attaining happiness. Even so, would you do it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both her tone and attitude were unlike that of a child. It told me that her words were not some kind of joke and I took a deep breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, I closed my eyes and confirmed my feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi always called my name with a soft smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">At times, she cuddled close to me asking to be spoiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichii."</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever she called me with that charming tone, my heart was unable to calm down.</p>
<p class="null-p">And also...</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. I love you, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">I heard it many times. Each time they brought me sorrow. Yet, there was not a single time when hearing her confession didn't make me happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, I really do love Natsumi, in the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I don't mind. If it means that I can face the future together with her, I'm ready for anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing my determined words, Rinka responded with a firm nod.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5</p>
<p class="null-p">Christmas Eve. As usual, our meeting spot in the business district was crowded with people. When I first visited this place, I was restless and full of tension, but now…</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all these repeats, I stopped feeling even that."</p>
<p class="null-p">That said, if you asked me whether my tension completely disappeared, that was not the case. Especially because me and Rinka swore that we would end this incident today. Whenever I thought of that, I just couldn't settle down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry, did you wait long?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I just came here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hehe, thanks."</p>
<p class="null-p">She wore a corset skirt that emphasized the chest area, and a thick, red coat on top of it; it was an appearance that I go too used to seeing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks good on you."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was already so used to this situation that I had no trouble saying lines like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't expect you to say that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, it's Christmas Eve and all. Anyway, let's go." Thus we began our walk.</p>
<p class="null-p">The town was decorated in many colors, with merry christmas songs playing here and there. The people walking back and fro seemed quite lively despite the winter's cold chilling their bodies. Meanwhile…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, hey, Riichi! Don't take pictures so suddenly. Rather, why are you even carrying your camera."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I just can't calm down without taking it with me. Look here, I'm taking another one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, stop taking them without warning!"</p>
<p class="null-p">We walked along the street in a lively mood that wouldn't lose to the bustling around us. Me with a camera in hand, snapping her pictures, while Natsumi kept on complaining about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, you feel a bit different."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How come."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Like, you started suddenly photographing me… You have never done that until now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What, you wanted me to do it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not what I said!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I made sure to snap a picture of her embarrassed face.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew that if I looped again, then all the pictures I took today would be erased.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, I peeped through the finder, clicked the shutter and took her pictures.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything she saw, she felt, she heard, she touched.</p>
<p class="null-p">I made sure to leave behind how she looked today, this instant where we were together.</p>
<p class="null-p">I captured her anger, her laughter, and her embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">At times I took close-up pictures from the side, and at times it suddenly felt like taking a wide-angle photo with the townscape. Emphasizing Natsumi in a portrait and blurring her with the scenery as a snapshot were both new experiences for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure feels quite embarrassing to be photographed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But it is fun, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A little bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">I made sure to snap the picture of her current bashful face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since the time on the rooftop, I've never based my pictures on Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her pain of loneliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her serenity that's hard to disrupt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her intense stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her pained look that affected me and her existence that embedded itself into my heart. I believed that I could never take a picture that would exceed the picture that managed to capture these things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Making Shiranamise Natsumi the theme was something like a taboo for me.</p>
<p class="null-p">She shouldn't be touched, she shouldn't be corrected...I cannot direct my lens at her without a valid reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">Deep down, I always, constantly thought so.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi was always close to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shiranamise Natsumi remained somewhere far away.</p>
<p class="null-p">As such, I kept running away from photographing a girl called Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">I'm still not able to express her world any better than that. I kept thinking that somewhere deep down.</p>
<p class="null-p">But now, I could freely capture her figure in the finder.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, now I knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">About the happiness she sought.</p>
<p class="null-p">About the greedy happiness slumbering at the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I came in contact with something that made me despair and crushed my heart, I now became able to direct my lens at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her loneliness was certainly not filled with silence alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somewhere deep, far deeper, there was also the wish brought upon by her loneliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">I should not be misled by her heartrending appearance alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">She lived in a world of her own, and for that reason, her desire was stronger than anyone else's and knew no bounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was something only I knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">And something she only showed me.</p>
<p class="null-p">That meant that, in the entire world, there was no one but me qualified to express it.</p>
<p class="null-p">If I was Natsumi's one and only supporter in the world, then she too was my one and only subject.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Quite self-righteous, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whatcha mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a secret."</p>
<p class="null-p">I mean, it was embarrassing to say something like "I want to monopolise you". Stuff like that should be… like, there should be a more appropriate setting for those lines, right?</p>
<p class="null-p">At the very least, it was not something I should've said while walking downtown like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aah, my face feels hot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing to feel so embarrassed about."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course I will be embarrassed if you take so many pictures. Hey, show me the pictures you took."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nope. They aren't finished yet anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No fair."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was about to take a picture of her pouting face, but a clear voice addressed me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, could I request a picture too?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I knew who she was...no, exactly because I knew who she was, seeing her stiff attitude made me almost burst into laughter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka stood there in an admirable manner, suppressing her hypocritical courtesy. Along with her conspicuous white hair and fluorescent blue eyes, it seems that she even dressed for the occasion. Her clothes were a perfect fit with no faults, and they matched well with her appearance, making her look quite otherworldly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, amazing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I could see the reason Natsumi felt so surprised. Just about anyone would've reacted the same way if the current Rinka called out to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Um, did you hear me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah. A picture, was it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was just captivated for a second, was there a need for her to glare at me like that? It's okay, I get it. I will properly fulfil my role, so you focus on yours.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I came here on a trip, but I'm returning home tomorrow, so I was just looking around now. Then I noticed someone with a camera and wondered if they would be kind enough to take a commemorative picture of me. Um, did I do something I shouldn't have?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, nothing like that. Is there a place you have in mind?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see. In that case, is it alright with you if we walk a bit?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka started walking without wavering. She walked with her head held high downtown, but perhaps because of her unrealistic appearance…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel like she's getting a lot of attention."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, when they see that, I can understand why."</p>
<p class="null-p">As we walked behind her while whispering to each other, we looked like some plebs in her presence. As if she was a princess and we her servants.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see, for now, would you mind taking one picture over there?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Without a moment's delay, Rinka headed to the place in question and took a pose. Rather, she looked quite used to all this. Was she a model or something in the future?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amazing. She is like a model."</p>
<p class="null-p">It apparead that Natsumi felt the same. But through the finder, Rinka looked so perfect in that pose that I felt like I had become a pro cameraman just by directing the lens at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me, are you a model or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, It's nothing like that. One of my family members is a professional cameraman, so I kind of became a natural at stuff like how to stand and pose as I spent time with him."</p>
<p class="null-p">I understand that they are meeting for the first time, but isn't she a bit too curt there? Is our plan for today going to be fine with her acting like that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"To tell you the truth, I wanted for him to come with me to this country, but sadly it was not possible. He is quite a busy person, after all. So I want to at least bring back the memories with me. I want him to see that I truly had fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is...that so. Um, could you tell me your name…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. I am Rinka. And you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm Natsumi. Shiranamise Natsumi. The one with the camera is Kuroe Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">I gave a slight nod to Rinka who was stealing glances at my direction in a way that only she would see it. I was fully aware that from now on would be the decisive moment of today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi. Why not keep her company for a little longer? Having only one picture as a commemorative photo sounds too lonely. Plus she seems to be alone and no one to depend on."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-Yeah. But Riichi, Today is…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know. But just for a little bit. I'll just take a few more pictures and it'll end with that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Okay then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Well, her dissatisfaction was quite natural. Anyone would react the same way if a guy said something like this in the middle of their Christmas Eve date. But sorry, Natsumi. Just for today, please do as I say. Otherwise, there will be no future for us.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you sure? I thought you two were on a date?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, we can't really leave you all alone now, can we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka intentionally acted apologetically and it became the final push Natsumi needed. In a situation like this, she would never refuse such a request. Above all, she wouldn't be able to leave a lonesome girl all by herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, she herself knew all too well how loneliness felt.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah...right. Let's go then...make some more memories."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her reply lacked in vigour but she still ended up nodding. Okay. With this, we now have an excuse for Rinka to tag along with us. From now on, we have to think about how to spend today having fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">We had to make today so fun that she would forget about the confession and into a normal day where friends spent time together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, your expression looks kinda bad"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? What brought that on?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, nothing, it just seemed like that. By the way, are you two dating, after all?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Huh? What brought that on!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you are acting that flustered, it seems still not. I mean, I was a bit hesitant to intrude on a dating couple."</p>
<p class="null-p">No well, it's no different when two people are together on Christmas Eve...but let me just keep my mouth shut here. It is my intention to have her tag along, after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have some experience so I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh? Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure is tough, isn't it? With an irresolute guy as a partner, although you keep waiting for him, he just keeps on worrying and worrying. Wouldn't you agree?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A...ahaha. Yeah, I don't know."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi, please stop looking at me like that. I'm starting to feel like running away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand your troubles, Natsumi-san. Well then, how about we continue this topic as we walk? I leave the camera duty to you, Riichisan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh!? Wait, Rinka-san!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please just call me 'Rinka'. Besides, I assume I am younger than you, so there's no need for honorifics."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka grabbed her hand and half-forcefully dragged her along. Bewildered Natsumi kept looking in my direction, but sorry, Natsumi, for now I'm a simple cameramen.</p>
<p class="null-p">But her bewilderment only lasted for a short while, and within thirty minutes, they became so close one would think they've been friends for a decade.</p>
<p class="null-p">I don't know what the cause of that is at all. Well, I'm lying. The cause is as clear as day. Me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka kept bringing up topics about indecisive men and wanting them to be frank, and before long, Natsumi also got into it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Which reminds me, Rinka did tell me that yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I want to get close to Natsumi-san, all we need to have is some girl talk. Regardless of the time or place, love talks were what connected girls and deepened their bonds."</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, I don't recall giving you permission to badmouth me so one-sidedly!</p>
<p class="null-p">Honestly, my stomach hurts just from listening to your conversation, so I wish you would stop. Hey, can I just go home?</p>
<p class="null-p">Can't you two just enjoy the day yourselves?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, look. He isn't listening to people, that's why he's so hopeless."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi sure does that quite often."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, aren't you being a little too cruel…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Why do I have to feel so miserable during the Christmas Eve?</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is the school you two attend. I feel excited for some reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We really snuck in huh… Will we be alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. I did try it out a few times, but they never told me off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, I didn't know you were such a bad boy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave me alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">We snuck into the school while talking a bit more merrily compared to the previous loops. Because I've been through it so many times, if you asked me whether my conduct felt a little too light, you'd be quite right.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, still, today was the final day.</p>
<p class="null-p">After this, I would stop sneaking into the school on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"School feels quite strange at night."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi-san, you are studying here right? Is it hard?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A bit, I guess. But school is fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san… I suppose there's no need to even ask."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what was that supposed to mean."</p>
<p class="null-p">Who knows, Rinka smiled at me quite implicatively, but even I found the school fun. In fact, after meeting Natsumi, the school became incomparably more fun compared to before it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, so far everything was going as planned. Our date plan was nowhere to be seen. Rinka had become so intimate with us that it felt as if the three of us had promised to spend this day together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So this is the classroom. Oh, it's locked, huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you are right. And here I thought how fun it would be to go in."</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this point, I don't even know what we came here for. Natsumi-san and Riichi-san's date plan sure is full of holes, isn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rinka, shut up already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh wow, are you mad? You are sooo childish."</p>
<p class="null-p">We walked through the deserted night school while messing around. It seemed that we couldn't anter any of the rooms, and even the toilets were closed, but the three of us just spending time like this made the experience plenty fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you can laugh like that, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I mean, usually you act like you are trying to be someone else. It's like you are trying to look cool. But I see that you can show such honest smiles too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait a second, what do you mean by that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I don't mean anything more than I said."</p>
<p class="null-p">Giggling at me from the side made me awfully embarrassed. Am I really that different from normal?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But I like either side of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, thanks for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, look. That's what I meant. Putting on airs like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing their murmurs made me feel embarrassed and I instinctively hastened my pace. But I think Natsumi saw through even that… I feel quite embarrassed now.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, that's not it.</p>
<p class="null-p">This pleasant feeling is something different. I wonder what this ticklish sensation is?</p>
<p class="null-p">It feels embarrassing but not unpleasantly so.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you two. Stop being so carefree and come at once."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka who walked a step ahead of us popped her head from the stairway and peeked at our direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's boring, not being able to get into classrooms. What should we do about this, Riichi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, my bad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as we ascended the stairs we didn't cease our chatter. Our bustling, noisy and friendly chatter was in contrast to the night school's serenity, yet for its daytime, it was quite a common sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rather, it just doesn't make sense, does it? For a Christmas Eve date plan to have sneaking into school as a possible option. What kind of nerves do you have?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shut up. It took my all to think of even this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not sure what to think of it when going to school is what comes to your mind in such a situation. Don't you agree, Natsumi-san?" Our stride naturally lightened too.</p>
<p class="null-p">As we spend time enjoying the atmosphere together in frivolous spirits, Natsumi said things she would usually never be able to say. "Eh, I think it's fine. I know that also adds to his charm."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wow, that's quite a sweetheart bias. Oh, why do you look so embarrassed, Riichi-san? I feel quite sad with you two… it's like I'm the only one single here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-That's not-!? Even me and Riichi aren't… right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, well. Right. We aren't... yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"'We aren't...yeah', you say? Pull the other one! That alone is giving me heartburn!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, our stroll led us in front of the gate leading to the rooftop. We were so engrossed in our talk that I didn't notice it, but it seems we already reached so far.</p>
<p class="null-p">What is this I'm feeling, I wonder? The strange exaltation, mixed with tension of the impending moment and relief from finally reaching it, was silently filling my heart. This is where the fight to escape this loop starts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I suppose this will be locked too…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As Natsumi was saying that, Rinka turned the knob of the door that was supposed to be tightly shut.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐creak!</p>
<p class="null-p">"No way!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The door leading to the rooftop opened with a high-pitched metallic creak, betraying Natsumi's expectations, yet according to mine and Rinka's.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with a lively shout, Rinka rushed out to the rooftop self first. Me and Natsumi followed behind her as we observed her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So pretty!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the starry sky, Rinka bustled about on the rooftop with her hands opened wide as if dancing. The rooftop of our alma mater that stood in the dead center of the residential area, perhaps because there were no lights around, showed us a beautiful starry sky quite unlike what you'd expect in a city.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a clear starry sky, perfect for a winter's night sky, so clear even the words 'spilling over' couldn't fully describe it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the end, we stayed together until this late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right. I wish we could spend some time alone though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"C-Come on. Riichi, what are you saying all of a sudden."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your face looks quite red."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, ouch. I just teased you a little, there was no need to hit me so hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you are trying to hide your embarrassment, at least choose a cuter method."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-!? Riichi, you idiot. I hate you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Did I tease her a bit too much? Sullen Natsumi ran towards Rinka who was leaning on the fence, and they enjoyed the townscape spread before them together. I peeked through the finder and faced my lense towards them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, as I loosened the tension assaulting my entire body…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, come here. It's beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi called out to me. She was acting sullen until a second ago, but her mood suddenly changed. I really don't understand girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where is your house located at, Riichi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Me, Natsumi and Rinka side by side overlooked the dazzling townscape. In fact, the entire town was illuminated in Christmas colors so I was a little, no, very moved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My house is sandwiching the business district from the opposite side so it can't be seen from here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, I see. Nevermind then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that how you react after asking me yourself? At least show a bit more interest."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I mean, I don't really care about your house."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then why the hell did you even ask! Rather, she has already been in my house.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi-san, where's yours?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mine's over there. Around the middle of this school and the station."</p>
<p class="null-p">We glanced at where she was pointing at. The townscape submerged in the black of night was dark everywhere you looked, and only the silhouettes of the houses were visible along with the faint light coming from their windows. I had no idea which one her house was however. Rather, when I think of what's about to come, I just can't find in me to enjoy myself so simple-mindedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, is it that one? The triangle-roofed one three houses away from that square house?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Too bad, that's not it. It's really hard to tell when it's so dark, in the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mgh. Now that it's come to this, we have no choice but to sneak in again at daytime."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh, we can't do that. There will be others here, and it'll be bad if we get found out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's alright. When that time comes, we can just use Riichi-san as a scapegoat."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are using me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that a no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka spoke such silly things, but looking closely, her joints seemed to have turned white seemingly from gripping the fence with too much strength. It seems that she was just as nervous as I was.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after this, we continued our silly chatter. We talked about the sights we saw today, the food we ate and things we enjoyed. Even though we have spent less than a day together, it felt like we could talk forever about it. The atmosphere made us forget that we were on the school rooftop, a place that was normally off-limits, and we kept on talking and talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Our bustling voices seemed unfit for the beautiful sky spread atop the silent rooftop. We kept exchanging words between the three of us. Rinka spoke, Natsumi answered. I teased, Rinka retorted. Natsumi played stupid, I acted the straight man.</p>
<p class="null-p">The town's bustling from the distance felt pleasant to our ears; this was truly a moment of blissful happiness for us.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it wasn't the same compared to the sweet, enchanting time the two of us spent during the previous loops. But that's exactly why it filled my heart with such tenderness.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt less like the excited tension. It was a more boisterous, more enjoyable moment, the kind you might not even remember the next day.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that made it all the more necessary for me to burn this moment into my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have to remember every second of it...so after a while, yes...even when I grow up, I could look back and be nostalgic about how good it felt back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">18:29.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stole a quick glance at the time, and it seems that it was already a suitable moment now. My eyes suddenly met Rinka's and responded with a small nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">I exhaled a faint but deep sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">I clutched my trembling hands with all I had.</p>
<p class="null-p">I tried to convince my violently pounding heart that everything would be all right.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, let's go somewhere a bit higher."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, I said the decisive words that would connect us to our future.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, my heart started to fill with a feeling that was far beyond bitterness. This nauseous feeling was from remembering about the time I killed Natsumi 2 loops ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, I said the same words and took her along.</p>
<p class="null-p">To a place higher than this rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that sounds good! Rinka-chan, come here. We can see an even better scenery from there."</p>
<p class="null-p">But Natsumi didn't know about that, and after inviting Rinka with a lively voice, she merrily walked towards the pile of garbage and started climbing on it. "Ah, no fair. Me too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka quickly followed after her. As they climbed up on it almost as if contesting with each other, I observed them as if it was some distant event.</p>
<p class="null-p">While I was glued into place by my trauma, the two girls called out to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, come on!! Stop looking and climb up!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's right. Don't try acting cool all by yourself and lets have more fun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Imitating the two, I stepped on one of the wreckage that was once a signboard. Half of it was hidden and only "yaki Stall" was visible, but it was probably either Takoyaki or Okonomiyaki. In any case, I stepped on some of those signs and started climbing up. Each of my steps pushed down the bitterness welling up in my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, Riichi. Be careful there!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Woah!? Come on, at least remove the nails from them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps because they were used on cultural festival, the plywood had nails sticking out of it, and I proceeded towards the girls as I avoided them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Amazing...this is amazing, Riichi-san!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hurry up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I reached the two that were hurrying me in high spirits, the scene that spread before me exposed my memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It sure is vast."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was certainly not as happy about it as they were.</p>
<p class="null-p">With Rinka between us, we stood on a place even higher than the rooftop. The scenery we saw from there was far more vast. Beyond the rows of houses, the business district looked dazzling even from this far away. However, only part of the buildings were tall, and the rest of the townscape spread far beyond that.</p>
<p class="null-p">I killed Natsumi with a scene like this in the background.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">I didn't respond to her voice, and merely nodded instead. I know. Don't worry. If I regretted killing the Natsumi of back then, if I regretted laying my hands on her, then I had to make the Natsumi standing by my side right now happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the only thing that could face my feelings of guilt. Besides,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, it's amazing, isn't it, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, it is, Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides, I really do love her, in the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I didn't want to let her die any more. That's why, I will deny even the happiness that she herself desires, and face the future. "You two really are close, huh? It's a little unbelievable that you aren't dating."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-!? Rinka-chan!?"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/boku-to-kimi-dake-ni_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"What's the matter, Natsumi-san? Riichi-san, look, she's red like a tomato. So cute~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-Hey, stop. Stop teasing me so much!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">For now, the plan was going smoothly. If we could end the day by enjoying ourselves like this, we would somehow be able to reach the next day.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with that, we would finally escape this loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow will come."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will it go so smoothly, I wonder?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka, what are you saying? Weren't you the one who said it? That as long as we could make the most of today, as long as we could get Natsumi to completely forget about confessing, we could open the path towards the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">"Understood. Then, Riichi-san, please reject Natsumi-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I already tried that, but it didn't go well. Besides, me rejecting her would not sit well with you either, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I fixed my eyes on Rinka. On December 23rd after school, my chilly room was engulfed in dead silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because your method was wrong. ...If she still confesses to you even after learning about Diva, then this is the only way. Before she ends up confessing, please put an end to her love yourself." "Wait a minute. I just told you that didn't go well, didn't I…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka remained irritatingly calm while I my mind was in a mess. How the hell can you say something like that without batting an eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Besides, didn't you say it yourself? That if we parted ways, Natsumi would become Diva's ally and that would be the worst outcome? I remember it clearly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I put the feelings I wanted denied into words and bared them at Rinka. Because...because, I felt relieved after our previous conversation. Because she claimed that we would never part, regardless of what kind of situation we fell into.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why the hell are you suddenly going back on those words!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, calm down please. I did say that about you parting, but I never said a word about you rejecting her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that just a goddamn sophism!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll explain it all, so calm down. Even I want to avoid separating the two of you. If that happens, I won't be able to protect the future I should be protecting. That is one thing that should be avoided at all costs."</p>
<p class="null-p">I was overpowered by her words who seemed to be trying to endure something, and sat back down after my emotional outburst.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what would rejecting her accomplish?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please stop snapping at me like that. In short, the problem is how you reject her. For example, if I suddenly appear tomorrow and say I'm your girlfriend, that would lead to the worst kind of result. Depending on the situation, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of you getting stabbed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you messing with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka's joking attitude was pissing me off.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was still irritated, so how come she was so calm now?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, I'm happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I asked suspiciously, she returned a big smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for desiring the future. If you didn't feel that way, and you chose to keep looping according to Natsumi-san's wishes, there would be nothing else I could do."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-What's with you all of a sudden."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's nothing, I just felt that I had to mention this first. Otherwise, it didn't seem like you'd be willing to listen to me. So, thank you very much. For desiring the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like I'm doing it for you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right, I wasn't doing it for someone. I was simply choosing the future where I would be together with Natsumi. Even if that would look like I was doing it for Rinka's sake…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you embarrassed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really aren't honest when it counts, Riichi-san. If you keep that up, Natsumi-san will fall out of love, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I was taken aback by her comments as she continued giggling, and I couldn't find in me to keep objecting to each and every thing she said. "So, what should I do tomorrow exacly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that it had come to this, I just had to let go and get back on topic.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's remain friends forever. That way, you'll never be alone again".</p>
<p class="null-p">You just have to say that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, please remain by my side, Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was something we once spoke about at school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If we continue to loop permanently, then I can be with you forever. Come next year, our exams will finally get serious, and I was afraid that our careers would have separated us. But...you know, if we continued to loop like this, I can stay with you like this forever, right? In that case, why do we have to escape from such a blissful thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was something she said in the previous loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi always feared parting with me. The thought of separating from her always made me anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, if that did happen, there would be no one else left to understand her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, I should reject her? I should tell her to remain friends forever and put an end to her love, is what you are saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Simple, right? You'll reject her but you will still remain together." For a moment, I couldn't understand what she was trying to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the next moment, I finally grasped the meaning of those words and chills ran down my spine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You...are you really human…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, yes, though I was born into the far future."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that, but I just couldn't believe that the same blood was flowing in our veins.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or else, how would she be able to say those words?</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, that was nothing but deception, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">To escape the loop, I would have to deceive my own heart, betray my love for Natsumi and continue doing that forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I...I love Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no way I would be able to endure that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Keep lying to myself, betraying Natsumi, and continue being her friend and supporter...how could I possibly manage to do something so cruel?</p>
<p class="null-p">Don't joke with me!</p>
<p class="null-p">There's no way I'll ever…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then are you going to keep on watching as she keeps dying? Are you going to give up? On the future with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't that just some lip service? If the future we are heading to is something so cruel, then I'd rather leave it as is!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But the future can be changed."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can be changed. I said it, didn't I? That Natsumi-san would one day create the means to oppose Diva. And that the world would view her as a hero. At that point, everyone would know about Diva. At that point, everyone would understand her world. So…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, you are telling me to keep enduring until then? That I should remain by her side as a friend and keep lying to her? Don't fuck with me!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A loud thud could be heard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You...youuu!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rii...chi...san…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her painful voice suddenly brought me back to my senses. Before I realised it, I was sitting astride her and pushing her down on the bed. And my hands were grasping the collar of her hoodie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Cough...Cough…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her violent coughing filled me with feelings of guilt. What the heck was I doing? Regardless of how angry I was, how could I do something like this…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is there no other way? Is that really the only way…? Do I have no other choice but to keep on lying to her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">To my bitter words, Rinka responded with a wordless nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was my head filled with only those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi said it, didn't she? That she wanted to be together at all costs.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was someone who'd choose staying together over her life, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">If she learned that her love wouldn't come true, just how much pain would that make her feel?</p>
<p class="null-p">Imagining her in that moment crushed my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's the only way, huh…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Just how hurt would this make Natsumi? I'm sure she'd cry, suffer and feel unimaginable pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That is the method for the two of you to arrive at the future. Moreover, this method has been proven in the future." I processed her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">I kept trying to get myself to accept them somehow.</p>
<p class="null-p">I had to hurt Natsumi with the method she desired the least. Could I really do that…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will also support you during that time. I'll join up with you with the appropriate timing and we'll act together after that. So that there's no falsehood in your request to be friends forever, let's make it the most enjoyable day spent as friends."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a method that utilised the loneliness in her heart. It was a cowardly move that took advantage of her solitude. But, still…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Will it… really lead us to the future?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Got it. Then, what exactly should I do tomorrow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It took my all to come to grips with the idea of hurting Natsumi, so I couldn't think of what exactly I had to do during the appointed day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even now, I kept searching for another way in my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Rinka continued without minding that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll make up the reason myself, so you just keep up with me. What's important is for the two of you not to end up by yourselves. I'll become a hindrance that disrupts your harmony. If it all goes well, we'll be able to get out of this loop."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Got it. Let's just get out of this loop somehow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. Also, I have one more request."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please make sure to head for the school rooftop at the very end. This is the most important part."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression was dead serious as she said that so I gave a firm nod. She was apparently putting on a bold front more than necessary as the moment she relaxed she started smiling jokingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay, being shy to strangers is unknown to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...No one cares about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We might as well enjoy it. It's still Christmas Eve, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are one heartless bastard, you know."</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, a powerless laugh was all I could muster.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, today, December 24th has been going very favourably so far. The mood hasn't turned the slightest bit amorous, instead, the girls hit off so well it was hard to believe today was their first time meeting each other. Yet, Rinka was still doubting whether it would go well...why would you say that!</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Abies Tower is about to be illuminated."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it really that pretty?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It's even featured in various magazines every year."</p>
<p class="null-p">While chatting, Rinka and Natsumi gazed at the Abies Tower far in the distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Checking the time, it was already 18:53. Only a little bit was left until the illumination at 19:00.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I became aware of it, my tension grew all the more.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was something we promised to view together, but never got to see no matter how many times we repeated it. That was now almost imminent.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's okay. It will be alright.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka was saying something, but the current us had not the slightest mood going between us. If the three of us just viewed the illumination, and smiled at the beauty of it, it would be the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">18:56.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ah, shit. I can't calm down at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since earlier, my heart keeps accelerating along with the passage of time. What is it, why am I this nervous.</p>
<p class="null-p">18:58.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, it's about to begin."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, you're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even my words towards her lively words was far too rigid. I started feeling restless around at my feet. But it couldn't be helped, could it? It was about to happen. It looked like we would be able to finally reach that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">18:59.</p>
<p class="null-p">The final minute started its countdown at least. But that single minute felt awfully long. Why? How? Is time really this slow to pass? There's no way that's true, is it? Hurry, hurry up. Ahh, damn it. Why am I being so impatient, I couldn't even understand that now. But, at any rate, it was about to happen. In just a bit, we would reach the time we were never able to reach during the loops. So…</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's lit!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">It came along with her shout. The Abies Tower in the distance, the long and tall tower standing at the center of Misono lit up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">An indescribable excitement ran through my very being. It was different from the refreshing, uplifting feeling. At any rate, that feeling as if my blood was boiling ran through my body from the tips of my feet all the way to my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-Eh, wait, Riichi. Why are you crying!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">For a second, I couldn't understand what she meant. But the next moment, I finally noticed it...what these warm drops sliding down my cheeks were.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Did it move you that much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah...yeah. That's right. I was moved all right. I mean, look, it's so pretty!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course I would be moved. I was seeing this scenery for the first time, after all. I kept looping for all this time. The time period from December 22nd until just before 19:00 of 24th.</p>
<p class="null-p">I saw the same sights and did the same things again and again, spending the days as if I was watching a movie I had long since grown tired of. In that time there was nothing new, and my views on it could be summed up in a single line - Same thing again, huh. And because of that…</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I've seen something so beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">I had completely forgotten what it felt like to encounter something new.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aah, I see. I'm happy now. That's why I'm crying. I was seeing something I never did until now. And, and moreover…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, It makes me crazy happy that we get to see it together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"C-Come on, Riichi, what are you saying?" There was a girl I could share my feelings with.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was it, this is exactly it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I wanted to feel this sensation many more times in the future, and during those times I wanted to have her by my side...that's why I… I really did want to proceed to the future, in the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was quite an exaggerated reaction, Riichi-san. But well, it's a rare moment so we might as well take a picture, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka said in exasperation but I finally reached this point. She could let me be at least this excited for a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Riichi. We are taking a picture so come here."</p>
<p class="null-p">And as we were about to take a picture with the illuminated Abies</p>
<p class="null-p">Tower behind us, just as we were about to move positions…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Natsumi's monotone voice, I turned towards her only to be greeted by her floating figure with her eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her long hair spread out like wings, reflecting the dazzling city lights, and as I was captivated by her pretty figure,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I dashed towards her to catch her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I realised that she had missed the footing, I caught the offbalance Natsumi in my hands and hugged her as tightly as I could so she would not get injured on the pile of trash.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">I started slamming into everything, so much that even her voice started sounding distant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Guh-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt heat travel through my right arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Pain like I've never felt before, as if the flesh was gouged out from me, started to paint my vision in deep red. I had no time to even understand what had happened as my head got slammed into something with a terrible sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi!? Riichi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I faintly opened my eyes to respond to the desperate pleas of Natsumi, I saw a white haired girl accompanied by the winter's night sky looking down at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">"With this, you will reach the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Rinka before me appeared so mystical and beautiful, as if she were an angel. As my consciousness was taken from me, I held on to such out-of-place emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi! Hey, wake up, Riichi!!"</p>
<p class="null-p">While listening to Natsumi's grieving voice, my consciousness was suddenly cut.</p>
<p class="null-p">What the, isn't this basically the complete opposite of what happens during the loops?</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-p">December 28.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I lay on the bed, the clock before me displayed that date. When I woke up for the first time, December 25 was written on it. From then on, every time I saw the date change, I was overcome with a sense of security.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, that was the proof that I escaped from the loop.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Examination result is the same."</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet, when I saw it now, I couldn't feel anything but emptiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because, even though I escaped from the loop, the price I had to pay for it was immeasurably big.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kuroe Riichi. The chances of recovering your right hand is extremely low."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was all I could muster to respond to the doctor's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Its because your nerves themselves are damaged. It's different from a mere bone fracture."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">The doctor still continued to pour salt on my wounds as I kept responding indifferently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not like there's no hope at all. If you continue rehabilitation, I'm sure you will be able to move it like before. I will support you too. Let's do our best together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Did he think those pretty words would comfort me? Did this Doctor really understand it? I might not even be able to move my right arm anymore, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it because I kept those kinds of thoughts to myself? My heart had tasted a sudden shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In any case, keep resting for some time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okay. Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">I remained indifferent all the way until the Doctor left. I was thankful that he cheered me on once again just before he left, but just what was the point in motivating myself now, goddamnit…</p>
<p class="null-p">I closed the sickroom door with a quiet sound of air leaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the Doctor left, I was the only one left behind. That caused the silence to grow even deeper and I could no longer settle down. I never thought being alone felt so painful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shit…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, it was too much. Along with entrusting myself to the bed, I ended up sinking into my thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I suppose I should consider myself lucky to survive after falling so gruesomely..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even as I tried to say something positive, it all felt too dry.</p>
<p class="null-p">I know. No matter how many times I tried to play tough, there was no meaning to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shit!"</p>
<p class="null-p">I swore without thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">I knew that wouldn't make me feel any better, but I couldn't help but do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, how could I even begin to accept it?</p>
<p class="null-p">It's my right hand, you know?</p>
<p class="null-p">Every part of my body took the hit, but it just had to be my hand to end up like this!</p>
<p class="null-p">After telling me I could never use it again in my life, what do you expect me to do?</p>
<p class="null-p">"At this point, I can't even hold the camera properly…" Shit, don't joke with me!</p>
<p class="null-p">Out of everything that could've happened, why did…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I did escape the loop, but how can I come to grips with something like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Goddamnit…</p>
<p class="null-p">Knock Knock!</p>
<p class="null-p">As I was sunk in my thoughts, I heard a reserved knock on the door. As I hurriedly wiped my eyes and responded to it, my voice came out trembling a little. I silently took a deep breath during the short time it took the door to open.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, it was past 10 oclock now. The only one who'd come right as the visiting period started was her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Riichi."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl - Natsumi had a heavy expression on her face as she entered the sickroom, as if she came here to get scolded.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fact that she was grasping her coat to the point of wrinkling it made it seem as if she was hurting far more than me despite not having suffered any injuries.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, Natsumi. You came again? Thanks for doing that during this valuable winter vacation."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it's okay. But sorry. If I'm being a bother, I'll return…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even now, when I imagined Natsumi jumping off the rooftop, I just couldn't let myself be sunk in grief. If I showed her a gloomy expression now, I was sure she'd seriously jump off the roof.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You idiot. There's no way that could be true. I was just feeling bored too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it cold outside?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Still snowing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, man, what a waste. It was a rare White Christmas, and I ended up missing it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again, I'm telling you it's not your fault."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Okay. I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless of what I said to her, she either responded with an absentminded nod or apologised. She looked to be lacking in vitality, perhaps because she was not sleeping at night.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her like that day after day depressed me. Her deep emotional scar made it look painful to watch her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I saw the Doctor leave your room earlier… Did anything happen?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she squeezed out her voice to inquire about it, I didn't know how to respond for a moment. But I wasn't sure what would happen were I to lie to her right now and tell her the examination results were good.</p>
<p class="null-p">Would she be happy? Perhaps so. Ever since they carried me to the hospital on Christmas Eve, she has never left my side. Even when they told me the examination results for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, she knew.</p>
<p class="null-p">That I may never be able to use my hand again. And just how much of an impact that revelation had on me.</p>
<p class="null-p">So if I lie, she would surely be happy. But…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, the results came today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐!"</p>
<p class="null-p">As I started to talk, Natsumi's body jolted in an eerie manner. The coat she was grasping slipped off from her knees.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your hand will heal right…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As she asked me fearfully, I silently shook my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment she heard that, Her face grimaced, as if she was about to cry. Seeing her like that made me feel like I was looking at my own self. I was on the verge of tears myself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sorry, Natsumi. I still can't tell you such a dreamlike lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems the nail that dug into my arm that day damaged my nerves.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether it improves or not… only time can tell."</p>
<p class="null-p">My heart creaked as I forced out those words. It was a fact that I was forced to acknowledge when I spoke it aloud.</p>
<p class="null-p">And it felt awfully heavy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, are you going to remain like that forever…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That, too, is something only time can tell."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is...that...so…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She dropped her shoulders in complete disbelief. As time passed without any conversation going, I didn't know what I should be feeling right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">My right arm that got injured when I fell from the pile of trash might never be useful again. I couldn't move the part starting from the elbow even a bit, so I couldn't even eat properly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu...Hic…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, I noticed Natsumi was crying. Her tears were spilling without hiding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry, Riichi… I'm sorry… Because of me…" I wasn't sure what to say to her as she apologized to me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Persuade her gently that it was not her fault?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if I myself haven't properly come to grips with it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Give me a break.</p>
<p class="null-p">I lacked that kind of courage now.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, it took my all just to hold back breaking into tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I knew that if I cried now, that would injure her even more…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I missed my footing..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you go there, I was the one who suggested climbing up there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, if only I paid more attention…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not your fault. It's not your fault, so please don't cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">My words never felt so empty. Even if I said that, there's no way that could comfort her. If I told her everything now, that might have changed things, but I couldn't even do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was crying in front of me, was there nothing but these meaningless words that I could tell her? Was I really this..powerless...?</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will do anything. For your sake, I will do anything. I did something so terrible to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's something you want, I'll do it whatever it may be. That will be my punishment. So…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with those words, Natsumi laid her hands on the buttons of her blouse. First, second, she undid the them one after another. Her white skin was exposed. Her soft bulges were covered in lace decorations.</p>
<p class="null-p">My mind couldn't keep up with the sudden development. What in the world was she doing…?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hurt me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her words reverberated in my heart. That shock finally brought me back to my senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What...are you doing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the end of those repulsive words, Natsumi stood while hanging her face. Her hair spread out and covered her face, so I couldn't see her expression. The contrast between her dark hair and white skin was awfully dazzling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, what in the world are you doing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"….."</p>
<p class="null-p">She said nothing. She was weakly embracing her body with one arm in a helpless manner. It looked as if she was trying to restrain herself to remain in this place. As if to say that was her punishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Filled with sorrow, I couldn't control my trembling voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">The corners of my eyes felt hot, but my tears stayed inside as if I had forgotten how to cry at all. My throat was on the verge of breaking into sobs, but it wasn't able to cross that final line.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's up with that. What are you doing…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her miserable state, my heart almost burst from sadness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her heartrending state, I could feel some indescribably ill feelings filling the depths of my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please stop, Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">You don't have to go so far.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Natsumi, please stop… I beg you…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Along with those words, I sorrowfully reached out towards her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her shoulders twitched. Avoiding touching her body even a bit, I tried to fix the buttons of her blouse, but her arm was getting in the way and it didn't go as planned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi, what are you…? You are going to wound me, right? If you don't, that won't serve as a punishment."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't...Don't say something like that. Please…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi. Just how much have you been cornered? A punishment…? And you are presenting your body to me for that?</p>
<p class="null-p">You are wrong, Natsumi.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's certainly not what I desire.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing. No, stop it, Riichi! Stop treating me so kindly!" "Be quiet and stay still."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because my right arm was useless, I had great trouble with buttoning her shirt. She kept squirming, but I made her sit still and somehow finished buttoning her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stop… Don't be kind to me. I'm not worthy of something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Please, Richi, hurt me… If not, I'll go crazy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her words sounded as if she was desperately trying to find salvation, and they made my heart tremble. Her eyes, dyed in sinful colors, were stirring up my carnal desires and drawing me in like a light trap.</p>
<p class="null-p">I was certain she would not refuse it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She accepted me, and she desired it as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that's exactly why I could not do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why? Why are you shaking your head? Please Riichi, punish me. Don't hold back, hurt me. Scream at me that I did something horrible to you, come on, please."</p>
<p class="null-p">She pleaded to me with tears, but I still shook my head. Even if I did it, the ashen sadness filling my heart would still remain the same color.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you really desire a punishment...then live together with me. Live on through this sad and painful future that has lost many things." I was surely saying something very cruel right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was harbouring such immense guilt, yet I was telling her to live.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if she wanted punishment, that was only appropriate, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your sin would only be cleared if you keep on living." And, it was the same for me too.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have hurt her this much.</p>
<p class="null-p">My sin could only be cleared by keeping on living together with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that really okay? Can I really remain at your side…? I did something terrible, but can I still stay with you…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked at me as if clinging to me, looking just like a lost child. Unreliable, anxious, completely lost and on the verge of being crushed…</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichii…"</p>
<p class="null-p">When I noticed, I was hugging her with my remaining left arm. I hugged her small head, pressing it on top of my shoulder. As she continued sniffling and couldn't see my face anymore, I found it a good opportunity to silently shed tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You can. You can...Natsumi."</p>
<p class="null-p">I sustained a wound that may never heal again.</p>
<p class="null-p">I even heartlessly damaged the love I held so precious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, there was a future that I obtained.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was the best thing to do? Was there any other way I could have handled it? I keep thinking, but the answer is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hence the cruel conclusion.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't even choose it, I was forced to choose it. The endlessly priceless and fleeting thing that we call future. At the cost of sacrificing many things in exchange.</p>
<p class="null-p">I could not agree with it.</p>
<p class="null-p">I couldn't even sort my feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps I will keep on regretting it for the rest of my life, thinking there might've been another possibility, another way to do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, if this is the future we have arrived at, then we have no choice but to do something about it from now on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi's love was painted over by the feelings of guilt in her heart…</p>
<p class="null-p">And I couldn't even embrace her with my wounded arm…</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, we have no choice but to aim for the future and live on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ueeh…uuuh….hic…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐Kh!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if that means I had to get soaked in two person's worth of tears. Even if we keep on remembering this sorrow every time this time of year visits us.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, there will be no Christmas that fun ever visiting the two of us again.</p>
<p class="null-p">▼</p>
<p class="null-p">After Natsumi cried herself out, she returned home with a miserable expression. I remained alone in the sickroom and fell into thought as I gazed at the moonlight shining in through the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">About the future and the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">Will there be a day when I can accept this sorrow in my heart?</p>
<p class="null-p">"The moon sure is beautiful tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It's so dazzling it's almost making me cry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's okay if you cry, you know? Even if you can't cry in front of</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi-san, please cry in front of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought you already returned back to the future, Rinka."</p>
<p class="null-p">The door closed with a light sound. Making her way through the dim light was a girl with white hair and fluorescent blue eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">I haven't seen her for the past few days, and now, she was in a pitiful state with bandages covering her head and thighs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much, Riichi-san. Because of you, the future can be protected."</p>
<p class="null-p">The serenity of the words she said while lowering her head seeped through me as if to comfort my heart that was worn down from sorrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, what did you come here for today? And at this hour, no less."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are so cold. Do you not want to at least see my face?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks who's talking. You never showed your face these past few days."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I had things going on too."</p>
<p class="null-p">I could only respond to her with a small nod of understanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem out of it. Is everything alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"More or less, after realising I finally escaped the loop. Hey, was I able to obtain anything?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You did, I'm sure of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">My question amused her, making her leak a faint smile. To think there was something I obtained in this future where only sadness and pain remained.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You pushed Natsumi off at that time, didn't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"‐‐So you noticed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I would."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka's expression I saw just before my consciousness was cut. It contained neither worry nor impatience, but instead, all I could discern was the bitterness caused by acknowledging the end result.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this the right outcome in the future?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then it can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...It makes me relieved to hear you say that, but are you really fine with this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course, if you ask me if I'm fine with it, my answer would be a definite no. But it's already in the past. Which means...yeah, it can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riichi-san, you've become strong."</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka's expression...It looked strained, as if she was forcing herself to laugh. Right, she surely suffered from this just as much. She suffered from what she did, the result it caused, and finally came here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How is Natsumi-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's awful. Honestly, I can't even bear to watch."</p>
<p class="null-p">She hurt me. She was surely thinking that, unaware of Diva's existence or Rinka's identity. That's why she harbored unbelievable guilt and was being crushed by it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really did something horrible, didn't I..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, it had to be done, right? So we have to carry that burden.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both you and me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, as I took a breather, another thought appeared in my head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Truth be told, I might not have desired the future at all." I spoke as I gazed outside the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you regret it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Rinka asked back with a clear voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, I do. Natsumi is crushed by guilt, while I sustained injuries that may or may not ever heal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yet, your tone suggests otherwise."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, that must be because I'm tired. It must be that."</p>
<p class="null-p">My heart was calm as if it were the most natural thing. When Natsumi was here it was full of grief, but now it was still like the surface of a calm lake.</p>
<p class="null-p">I felt calm, but at times, I also felt dreadful. Surely this calmness would be thrown into disorder once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Due to regrets, attachments and grief.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was not how the future should have been, it would surely not be something that unseemly and uncool.</p>
<p class="null-p">But still, I'm sure I would rethink it every time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, I arrived at a future where I get to live with Natsumi. Everything from now on depends on the two of us. "Rather, I can't do it unless I keep thinking like that." The future was synonymous to suffering.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was overflowing with sadness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still, the two of us swore to live on. We embraced each other's sorrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, from now on, I have to be by her side. If the guilt she is feeling my fault, then I have to dedicate the rest of my life to getting rid</p>
<p class="null-p">of it."</p>
<p class="null-p">That's why, this is my decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is my resolution, as well as what I've sworn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From now on, it will be a harsh path. For as long as she feels that guilt, Natsumi-san will never confess to you, and even if you confessed to her yourself, she would never accept it. She would not allow herself to be happy with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">It would surely be exactly as she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Currently, her heart was full of her guilt towards me, with not the slightest room left for love, and even if it did blossom, being who she is, she would surely entrap it in her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's the same for you, Riichi-san. Inside you, there's the guilt of injuring her. That's why, the two of you can neither part nor grow any closer. This curse-like relationship will continue for a long time, until that time comes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her fluorescent blue eyes shined beautifully in the dark room. As she directed those eyes straight at me, I responded with a firm nod.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will do my best. I finally arrived here after going through so many loops. Besides, after all's said and done, I really do want to be with</p>
<p class="null-p">Natsumi. I mean‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love Natsumi, after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, that was what I truly felt. Regardless of how much I suffered or grieved, those feelings alone would never change.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. I'm relieved to hear that."</p>
<p class="null-p">She bloomed into a warm smile. It looked so much like the one Natsumi would make I spontaneously opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, what would you call my and Natsumi's relationship? This relationship that's neither friendship nor love."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I don't know the answer to that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Thought so. In the end, we have to discover the nature of our relationship as well from now on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are me and Natsumi of the future...happy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I'm sure you are. From now on, the two of you will be exposed to the threat of Diva. But even so, it will be alright. If it's the two of you, you would surely arrive at a happy future."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How can you be so sure about that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I am the very proof of it… Father."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What...did you just…?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who knows? That's something you'll find out in the future." With those words, Rinka turned on her heel and opened the sickroom door. She took a step into the dim light permeated by silence and closed the door behind. The words she left behind at that time will forever remain within my heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then, enjoy your future and enjoy your life."</p>
<p class="null-h2">To be continue...</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">To those I'm meeting for the first time, nice to meet you. To those who I've already met, It's been a while. I'm Fujimiya Kazuki.</p>
<p class="null-p">One year since my previous work, I finally managed to get my second work out. The tastes have changed quite a bit in this one compared to the previous work, but I hope you enjoy this book just as much.</p>
<p class="null-p">The stories, Light Novels included, are things that dye the life in colors, enriching it. In fact, my life has improved after encountering countless stories. And because of that, I hope that the stories I create manage to improve others' lives even a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">And now it's time for the words of gratitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fal Maro-san. Thank you for drawing the illustrations that touched my heart. Pictures have so much strength, don't you agree? I cried when I saw a certain illustration of Natsumi. Yeah, this is her alright, I thought. I can't express my feelings with words. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chief editor, W-san. Once again, thank you. I've really, really caused you a lot of trouble. If not for you, I would not have completed this novel for sure.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were many others who helped me create this book. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that I have finished writing it, I once again think that there is still so much more I can do for creating a story. I will keep on writing books from now on too. I'll be in your care from now on, too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Winter 2017</p>
