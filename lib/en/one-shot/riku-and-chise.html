<p class="null-h1">Prologue</p>
<p class="null-p">This Summer, you have taught me lots of things.</p>
<p class="null-p">How pretty the color of the evening sun was as it set down between the mountains to the West. How passionate the scent of the green grass in the blooming summer could be. How the gentle colors of the starry night were all too dazzling. I knew nothing at all until this Summer came.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not even know that there is such a beautiful place in this village I grew up in.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world is so vibrant, and I have found everything in it so moving, but all I saw in those eyes all this time has been your lonely self.</p>
<p class="null-p">During this Summer, we were always together, Like Vega and Altair, so pure, so full of bliss.</p>
<p class="null-p">And even though the memories in my heart will stay forever,</p>
<p class="null-p">The Summer is about to come to an end.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus-</p>
<p class="null-p">We shall have to say goodbye.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 1</p>
<p class="null-h2">The Lonely Summer Vacation</p>
<p class="null-p">One moment, the white ribbon sparkled in the dazzling light of the sunset, the next, Chise's straw hat fluttered up high with the summer breeze.</p>
<p class="null-p">The white ribbon of the straw hat danced gently in the orange sky, like a feather coat, before finally perching itself at the tip of a large tree branch.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What do I do now…)</p>
<p class="null-p">The tree in question, dyed red by the sunset, was like an impish boy raising his hand up high. Chise could only look up at her hat worriedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was about an hour ago when she told the Andou-san, the homemaker, "I shall be going on a stroll," and went out of the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">The roads here were not concrete and pavements, but simple dirt paths, and everything was a brand new experience to Chise, whether it was the lush greenery, or that the brook was so clear that the rocks at the bottom were visible. As she had walked on, her eyes had grown wider and wider until the moment when a sudden gust of wind had ruffled her straw hat and carried it to the branch.</p>
<p class="null-p">The brook trailed off into the glitter of the sunset. There was much greenery by the wayside, and the large tree on which the straw hat was hooked was rough and scary looking. Chise took a single feel of it, and the skin was grazed off her palm.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been raised in the city and was never particularly good at sports, let alone tree climbing. Moreover, she was dressed in summer clothing - a white one-piece dress and fancy sandals. The waist-length hair would also be a hindrance in an attempt to climb the tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">The water in the brook moved along slowly into the distance, it's murmur the only sound that could be heard. Until suddenly...</p>
<p class="null-p">A bicycle headed straight down the path basked in the orange sunlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">A boy, looking to be just a little older than Chise, probably no more than a high school student, was riding it. He was dressed plainly, wearing a sweatsoaked shirt and faded jeans, the thin arms and the tense face bare to bake under the sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked towards Chise, and the girl tensed up at his standoffish expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">His lips curled together, and he slowly approached on the bicycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had assumed he would ride off but, unexpectedly, he parked next to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And even more surprisingly, this standoffish boy suddenly looked up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Straight towards Chise's straw hat with its white sash dropping down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tanned hands reached for branches, feet wedged against the bark, and he quickly scaled the tree. Then, he reached out to nudge the straw hat which fell straight to Chise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes widened as she caught it with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the boy saw Chise catch the hat, he hoped down from halfway up the tree and landed on the grass patch.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ground trembled slightly. The girl's slender shoulders followed suit.</p>
<p class="null-p">The orange sky turned scarlet in the meantime, making the world a little darker and things harder to see. The boy, appearing content with mission accomplished, hopped onto the bicycle and left towards the large setting sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise wanted to call out to him, but all that was left was his skinny back growing smaller in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was left standing there, holding onto the straw hat with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">(He kindly helped me out…but I did not thank him.)</p>
<p class="null-p">She dropped her shoulders, disappointed at how slow her response was.</p>
<p class="null-p">(But I should be able to see him again… for I will be spending this summer vacation here.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, she would make sure to thank him when they met again.</p>
<p class="null-p">She bowed deeply towards where the boy had left.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sun had set completely by the time Chise returned to the villa, and the housekeeper went out to welcome her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is late. I was worried that you were lost."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san was an elderly woman in her 50s, genial in appearance and kind. When Chise saw her for the first time, Andou-san kindly welcomed her in with a smile and a "Well, welcome." The girl immediately took a liking to her, so she felt really bad for making the elderly lady worry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's different here compared to the city. Everything is dark outside at night, and you can't see anything. There aren't many people walking outside either. Do ensure that you return before it gets dark."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's parents had never showed this much concern, so she was both a little dumbfounded and elated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I will be careful."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's honest reply made Andou-san's face relax.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What would you have first, dinner or bath?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, dinner please."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alright, I will go about preparing it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I shall leave it to you then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise lowered her head in gratitude. This caused Andou-san to narrow her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really are polite, Chise-san. It's rare to see a proper, polite princess like you. I suppose this grace of yours comes from being raised in a private girls school in Tokyo since kindergarten, no?" she said, sounding impressed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise blushed furiously and muttered, "th-that is not the case...I-I am normal," before hurriedly evacuating to the washroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was unused to being praised and did not know how to answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back in school, she was a genial, dull girl. "You're spacing out again, Chisechan," had been how she had often been teased. Never once had she been called classy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Being praised like this caused her to feel overly embarrassed, and even after washing her face in the washroom, her cheeks remained red.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her ablutions done, she went to eat the dinner Andou-san prepared for her. The meal consisted of lots of summer vegetables in a consommé risotto, herb-fried sautéed chicken, and a grapefruit jelly. She was being more mindful of her etiquette, and her usage of the knife and fork, than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each dish tasted delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is delicious," she remarked so bashfully that Andou-san narrowed her eyes happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Pleased to know that it suits your tastes well. Is there anything you can't eat?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was momentarily gobsmacked, which seemed to surprise Andou-san a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't worry. Please do say if there is anything," the woman prompted gently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise stammered,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I...cannot really eat, green peppers."</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san beamed further, her eyes narrowed again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My younger daughter never wanted to eat green peppers until she graduated from elementary school. Right now, she's still calling back to ask how to get her elementary-school-age son to eat them."</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that case, what should I do so that I can eat them?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I'll keep that a secret for now. If I reveal the answer now, Chise-san, you'll be flustered and keep wondering where the green peppers are hidden in every meal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all. A-and, it is not that I cannot eat them at all. Please serve them as normal."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, no. Please leave it to me. Is there anything you hate other than green peppers?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-everything else is fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise blushed in response, and upon seeing that, Andou-san beamed away.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sweet and sour cold grapefruit jelly was covered with sweet milk sauce.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise picked it up with the silver spoon, nibbling at it. It was really delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">While she was eating, Andou-san asked a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How does it feel outside?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps,‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"There might be not that much of anything out here, but the scenery is beautiful. You are in your third year of middle school, and did well on your entrance exams, haven't you Chise-san? Ah, but your school doesn't require any admission exams, does it? Oh yes, oh yes, if you take the bus to the town center, there is a cinema and a shopping mall."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she continued happily chatter throughout the meal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise only nodded somewhat apprehensively here and there, adding an odd question now and then in a teeny-weeny voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, she recalled that aloof looking boy. She thought of how he had helped her retrieve the straw hat from, and her heart started to race. She started to worry if Andou-san would notice her acting differently...</p>
<p class="null-p">"It would be great if your parents could finish work early and get here sooner…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san's carefree words stabbed Chise's heart like a needle.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the girl immediately ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, that would certainly be nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for the meal. It was really delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">After dinner, Chise intended to clear the cutlery, but ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, but that is my job."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ Andou-san stopped her firmly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-erm, then please at least allow me to bring them over to the kitchen." "Really, you make me question just who is the one hired to work here," replied the woman, rebuffing the girl with a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really obedient for a middle schooler. Your parents surely must be glad to have you."</p>
<p class="null-p">The compliment was muttered gently, but the words hurt Chise deeply once more. And yes, embarrassed her too. Therefore, the girl hurriedly gathered the cutlery, brought it back to the kitchen sink, and went up to the second floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's room, the place where she was going to spend her summer vacation, was an empty space facing the courtyard. The bed, desk, and chair were already lined neatly, all being old but sturdy, and made from wood that gave off a warm feeling. The curtains were in tender grassy-green with white lace resembling clouds. It was all really pretty.</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside, the girl leaned her back against the walnut-colored door and lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The long hair was draped down her cheeks, hiding her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was nobody else here, other than her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">So she stood there, frozen in that position for a long time until, finally, the edge of her lips regained a hint of life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even without looking into the mirror, she knew without a doubt what expression adorned her face. A feeble smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to be sincerely 'happy'.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a way that would allow her to smile a happier smile than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, she sat down on the chair facing the desk and took out the letter set she brought from Tokyo.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were illustrations of fish, clouds, watermelons, and fireworks on the envelopes and the postcards, spreading a perfect summer vibe. Just looking at it filled her with elation.</p>
<p class="null-p">She laid the color pens on top of the table, wondering which colors she should use for which postcards. The more she thought about it, the happier she felt.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, she picked a deep blue pen and a card illustrated with blue fish, and began to write to her bosom friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I arrived at the villa today.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back before the summer vacation, we talked about a distant relative of my father, called Shiori-san, who lived alone in this house.</p>
<p class="null-p">I imagined it to be a dilapidated, haunted place. Now that I look at it in person, however, it is a cute wooden cottage, one similar to a hut found in foreign illustrations. There are vines climbing the walls, vines that have leaves the shape of a heart. There is an allotment space in the garden where cucumbers and tomatoes can be harvested. There is even a red postbox at the side of the door. It is really cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">There is a brook nearby, and I can see farms ridges, fields, and a vineyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">The air feels refreshing. It feels comfortable living here."</p>
<p class="null-p">One by one, Chise started to recall all the wonderful things she had seen with her eyes, heard with her ears, and felt on her skin on this day. Perhaps writing about this to her friends excited her more than expected, because then she chose a sky-blue postcard, an orange pen, and started to write a message to her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Andou-san told me that the previous owner of this house was Father's distant relative, Shiori-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"She would visit twice a week, but only to help with housework, and hardly spoke with Shiori-san. She mentioned that Shiori-san was a really kind person, genial in tone, and everyone in the village called her a sage.</p>
<p class="null-p">I also heard that she was the prettiest person in the village when she was young."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that the desk, chair, and bed I am using now were used by Shiorisan. I found the poems Shiori-san wrote in the desk drawer, not on paper, but on the drawer itself, written in pen. I wonder how old Shiori-san was when she wrote it? The handwriting is pretty and elegant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"When you arrive, I will show them to you‐‐ "</p>
<p class="null-p">At this point, Chise stopped writing, stared at the text, and struck the words off with a pen. Then, she covered everything with correction fluid and wrote something different instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love this house, this village, from the moment I arrived. What beautiful scenery will I see tomorrow? I am looking forward to it. I will write to you again, Papa, Mama."</p>
<p class="null-p">'It would be great if your parents could finish work early and get here sooner…' That was what Andou-san had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her father was busy with work, and her mother was even busier socializing. Both of them hardly had the time, to begin with, but Chise knew very well why they did not come by.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them were back home, in Tokyo, discussing porce.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, they had arranged for Chise to come to this house, and spend her 15th summer here. This house had once belonged to a distant relative of her father, and that person had just happened to die this spring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe they had done it out of consideration, thinking she would be unwilling to hear their disputes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, for as far back as Chise could remember, the relationship between her parents had always been frigid. Even when the three of them ate together at the same table, they never smiled, and the atmosphere between the adults had always been tense. Surely, right now they were saying spiteful things to each other with a scowl on their face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise could imagine it, easily in fact, and her heart turned into a block of ice at the thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hand holding the orange pen stopped once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I cannot be thinking about this.)</p>
<p class="null-p">The more she thought about this, the heavier and colder her heart and body would become.</p>
<p class="null-p">Instead of that, perhaps she should find some joy, a wonderful thing, and tell her parents all about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely that would make them happier, and maybe even tempt them to come by instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, papa and mama would surely come then, smiling and loving each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is quiet here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The air puts me at ease."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise filled the sky-blue postcard with words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The orange ink looked very warm on the paper, almost akin to the color of sunset.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mind recalled the fluttering white sash and the sight of the boy handing over the straw hat. Recalled his thin face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The thin lips that were dyed orange.</p>
<p class="null-p">The standoffish eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sweaty shirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bicycle that departed before Chise could utter a word of thanks. The silhouette of the boy's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her frozen heart was slowly melting, and her lips broke into a natural smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a wonderful, amazing thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had always stayed at a girls school, and never had a proper conversation with a boy of the same age. On the train ride to and back from school, the boys were always together, chatting loudly, something she always found intimidating.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy who had got the straw hat down for her might have looked grim, but he had also looked earnest and had carried about him an air that was as serene as the morning sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will be nice...to see him again..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise whispered, feeling her cheeks heat up slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the first day of Chise's stay at the villa, she met the boy, and the meeting promised a wonderful start to her summer vacation. Just thinking about it caused her heart to throb.</p>
<p class="null-p">She slowly opened the desk drawer. Immediately, the graceful handwriting appeared before her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who is he?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did he sigh?</p>
<p class="null-p">These words were probably written by the previous owner of the house, Shiori-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">They also happened to be a very apt fit for Chise's personality, and the girl was mesmerized by them.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What is that boy's name...? If only we could meet again.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Her smile turned dreamy.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning, there was a 'ting' sound… Half-awake Chise heard a bell chime somewhere outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, there was a sound of a passing vehicle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise opened her eyes. The curtain, green like a young grass, dazzled as it absorbed the morning light.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was 5am.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whole two hours earlier than the usual time Chise tended to wake up.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put on her glasses, got off the bed, and looked out of the window. A truck just happened to pass by her doors.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Going to work this early? Must be hard,) she thought, her mind all fuzzy with sleep. Right at that moment, though ‐‐ ‐‐ She spotted a bicycle opposite the passing truck.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shocked, she brought her face closer to the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a boy riding on that bicycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slightly tanned skin; long, thin limbs; a skinny face...</p>
<p class="null-p">That was ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">(The person who retrieved my hat...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise thought that she was still dreaming.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy had stacks of newspapers on the back seat and in the basket of his bicycle. He parked in front of Chise's house and, never getting off the bicycle's seat, he inserted a layer of papers into the red postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">(So he's the newspaper boy!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart suddenly raced.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy's palm left the newspaper.</p>
<p class="null-p">He would be leaving!</p>
<p class="null-p">She had to hurry and thank him!</p>
<p class="null-p">Panicking, Chise opened the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">The windows here were old-fashioned and required her to use both hands.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/riku-and-chise_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">BAM! A loud noise exploded around the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">It shocked Chise and seemed to attract the boy's attention, for he lifted his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy's aloof eyes caught sight of her, arms still up, holding the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their eyes met.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those of the boy widened slightly in mild surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that was the moment when Chise remembered that she was still dressed in wrinkled pajamas and her hair was a straight-out-of-bed mess.</p>
<p class="null-p">Embarrassment roared in her thoughts as if her mind had been set ablaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sizzling heat spread onto her face, cheeks, and eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">(My face is red now!) she thought, all shriveled on the bed, hugging a pillow. She was so ashamed she even left the window open.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, with nothing to hold it in place, said window fell, with a loud thud.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise buried her face into the pillow, despite the fact that she was still wearing glasses. After brooding for a moment, a realization struck her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The window falling shut suddenly made a loud noise! Their eyes just met, and yet she made such a violent bang with the window. Would he not have a bad impression of her?</p>
<p class="null-p">Probably not? ...Maybe? It was so sudden…Chise kept feeding herself excuses as she inched her head towards the edge of the window, peeking at the outside again.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was the old gate of stacked stone.</p>
<p class="null-p">The red postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the boy on the bicycle had already disappeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do I do...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise hurriedly grabbed the comb, tidied her hair, removed her shabby pajamas, and put on the sleeveless one-piece dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she could not straighten her ruffled hair at all so, making do with the straw hat, she ran down the stairs with her glasses on, hastily put on her shoes, and headed towards the courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">The cool morning breeze gently caressed her bare arms and her heated cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Slightly gasping for breath, she went towards the postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once there, she peered onto the road outside, but naturally, the boy was nowhere to be seen. Chise lowered her head and looked towards her feet. There were bicycle tracks on the dirt path, and a newspaper was inserted into the postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">She took it with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she felt a tender warmth on her fingertips, like that of a bread loaf fresh out of the oven.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This is not a dream...)</p>
<p class="null-p">The warmth slowly spread over her, and even her heart too was warmed.</p>
<p class="null-p">(That boy had been here just now..)</p>
<p class="null-p">With this warmth, he delivered the newspapers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since he was a part-time newspaper courier, surely she could meet him again!</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise embraced the newspaper, hugging it firmly to her chest, and her heart filled with delight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chise-san, what is the matter?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san approached the door full of worry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had opened the window, then slammed it shut, hurried down the stairs, and went out into the courtyard. Surely Andou-san had heard all the noise involved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-sorry, did I wake you up? I got up too early, s-so I wanted to read the papers..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise embraced the papers firmly, lowering her head in apology.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, it's fine. I just woke up. I'll go prepare breakfast right away."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is fine. I-I will read the papers. Please take your time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise lowered her head and apologized again, before heading back up the stairs, straight to her room.</p>
<p class="null-p">The flooring had a cool rug laid over it. Chise gently knelt on that rug and, still excited, unfurled the newspaper.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a blush on her face, she started reading. From the headline news, through the social column, economic column, book reviews, personal advice, reader submission, classifieds, and even the weather report, she read all of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the contents never entered her mind, for, again and again, she kept recalling the tanned, skinny boy. How he parked his bicycle before the red postbox, and his expression when he lifted his face up towards Chise. By the end, the girl was blushing furiously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back at her home, in Tokyo, Chise's father had been the only one to read the papers. She had never touched one, not once. Thus, laying out the large black and grey printed sheets on the rug was a refreshing experience for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every time she flipped the pages with her fingers, the thin paper rustled, its faint scent tickling her nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was this the scent of ink?</p>
<p class="null-p">The window by the bedside remained open, and the grassy-green curtains were half-opened letting in both the sunlight and the cool morning breeze, allowing the sun to shine upon the black words.</p>
<p class="null-p">(We met again.)</p>
<p class="null-p">The grey background appeared to be glittering, and the pamphlets inserted between the pages scattered upon the floor like a colorful fan. Chise had a careful look at them too.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared there was a discount offer at the supermarket for cabbage and cucumbers. There was also information about second-hand vehicle sales and special summer sales at the department store. The large red '30% off', '50% off', and so on tugged at her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, Chise folded the newspaper, her cheeks now thoroughly red, and she looked up the TV schedule. The ink had stained her fingertips at this point.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I can meet him tomorrow again.)</p>
<p class="null-p">The swirling elation finally settled down into a faint sense of delight, spreading throughout her body little by little. Only then was she able to experience the next feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ah, but...)</p>
<p class="null-p">She recalled the attitude she had displayed, and she felt like somebody doused her in cold water.</p>
<p class="null-p">He might be angry. He was so kind to her, yet she slammed the window on him and hid. Maybe he wouldn't want to meet her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, her heart accelerated again, but this time for a different reason. She was still brooding over this when Andou-san's voice came from downstairs,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chise-san, it's about time for breakfast."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise looked up at the clock on the wall and saw that an hour had passed already.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes, thank you. I am heading down now."</p>
<p class="null-p">She folded the newspaper neatly, picked up the pamphlets that were laid out all over the floor, stacked those on top of the paper, and hurried down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I k-kept you, waiting. I'm sorry"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise panted as she stepped into the living room. Andou-san's eyes widened at the sight and she just said, "oh my."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise panicked, not knowing what exactly was so weird about her. Andousan explained with a stifled chuckle, "you are still wearing the straw hat."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise reached up and touched the brim of the hat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks sizzled. She removed it at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, erm…I also have yet to wash my face, and my hands are all dirty with ink…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl shriveled, intending to head straight to the washroom. But Andousan just smiled and said, "it appears you really like to read the newspapers. Is there anything interesting today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, not at all..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought a young princess like you wouldn't read newspapers, Chise-san. The previous owner ordered a year's worth but, after she passed away in</p>
<p class="null-p">Spring, I requested that they no longer be delivered for the time being. Now I'm glad they continued nonetheless."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was way too embarrassed to admit that she had never read a newspaper in her life back in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="null-p">So she did all she could to bluff her way through the conversation and quickly slipped out into the washroom to clean her hands and face.</p>
<p class="null-p">As she picked up the soap to scrub her fingers, she suddenly hesitated for a moment, unsure if she should wash away the black staining her fingertips.</p>
<p class="null-p">That feeling was too much even for her though and she conjured soap bubbles on her palm. Carefully scrubbing the newspaper stains away, she muttered to herself,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow... I will... Wake up earlier… And thank him... Properly..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ Chise had set the alarm clock to ring at 4.30am, but she woke up at 4am anyway and started fumbling about in the darkness trying to wake up and prepare.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put on a different one-piece dress than the one she wore the previous day and combed her hair neater than usual, actually managing to straighten her bed hair for once.</p>
<p class="null-p">She waited until the first traces of dawn appeared at the peak of the hill that before creeping into the courtyard while making sure not to wake up Andousan. The morning air was somewhat refreshing, yet chilly, and the courtyard was still covered in the pre-dawn gloom.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What time do the newspapers arrive...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky got gradually brighter as she waited. The crisp morning light shone at the ground and grass in the courtyard, and at the tomatoes and cucumbers in the garden, causing a slight change in their hue. Various uneasy thoughts went through her head while she was watching this process.</p>
<p class="null-p">(If it happens to be a different person today, what do I do...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Will I scare him by standing next to the postbox?)</p>
<p class="null-p">But there was no place in the courtyard for Chise to hide and, if she was to talk to him from behind the fence, it might make him feel wary.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was also afraid that, if she hid, she might be too embarrassed to come out, just like the previous morning…</p>
<p class="null-p">After much thought, she remained as she had been, waiting next to the postbox, all stiff and tense.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was listening carefully as she looked towards the road again. The boy on the bicycle appeared on the other end of the path right at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart throbbed loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hands grasped at the hem of the dress from both sides.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like on the previous day, there were newspapers stacked on the back seat and in the basket of the bicycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy seemed to have noticed Chise next to the mailbox, and raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise saw the grim look on his face and felt a wrench in her gut.</p>
<p class="null-p">(He-he is angry about what happened yesterday after all...)</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">But her legs were stiff, rooted in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bike approached slowly until it parked in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could not run away.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was right to wait by the postbox. Her heart was palpitating. She was so tense she feared she was about to explode. But having come this far, she had to follow through.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy remained aloof, watching her with some skepticism in his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My-my straw hat landed on the tree two days ago, and you helped me while</p>
<p class="null-p">I was wondering how to get it down. Thank you very much for doing that...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She put too much force into the bow and her hair slipped as a result. Her voice grew more shrill with every word.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she managed to express her gratitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">She lifted her head timidly and saw the surprise on his face, wide eyes and all.</p>
<p class="null-p">That caused her to tense up again and her shoulders started to shiver.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-and, yesterday, I shut the windows and hid. I am s-sorry for that too. I-I did not know you are the newspaper boy. I was… so rude."</p>
<p class="null-p">She apologized once more before lowering her head again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy's vague, deep voice gently caressed Chise's ears with his reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...It's fine," he said indifferently.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the first time Chise had heard his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she straightened back up she saw the boy was troubled by her apology. Once their eyes met, he hurriedly looked aside, drew a layer of printed sheets from the basket, and handed it to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's voice unwittingly became as soft as the boy's.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment her hands touched the newspaper, the moment her fingertips felt the same warmth as the previous day's, her heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy didn't look straight at her again and, after offering a vague hint of a bow, he sped off.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bicycle raced down the unpaved dirt path, quickly gaining distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise heard it leave, transfixed to her spot, watching it go.</p>
<p class="null-p">The warm newspaper remained in her hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐...It's fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">The exchange between them was brief, not even a conversation. However, Chise was on cloud nine as she returned to the house replaying the words in her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Great. I finally managed to thank him properly!)</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 2</p>
<p class="null-h2">Under The Skies Of August, My Heart Thinks Only Of You</p>
<p class="null-p">(Will the girl at that cottage again wait for the newspaper this morning?) It was 3.30am.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku was at the village's store, in the process of strapping the freshly printed papers onto the back seat of his bicycle. He looked up at the dark skies.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rain had been pouring for half the night already and, while the wind was muted, the girl, her long, pretty black hair, and her dress of clear colors, would all surely be soaked by the rain if she waited outside in this kind of weather.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had been an evening, a week ago, when Riku had met the girl from Tokyo.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a straw hat that rode the summer breeze amidst the last vestiges of the dazzling sunset. There was a pure white ribbon, untainted by the red sunset, that fluttered in the sky as the hat landed on the branch of a tree growing by the brook.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a girl standing beneath the large tree, with long, black hair and slender of body, looking up at the hat with worry in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was dressed in a pure-white, one-piece dress. Her white legs were wrapped by the straps of her little sandals. Her arms and neck were equally pale, so slim, feeble, and posh that they threatened to snap at any given moment. One could tell she was fresh off the boat.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the girl living at the villa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Behind the bridge over the brook, there was an old house with walls covered in vine and lush greenery in the garden. One that had been empty ever since its previous owner had died in spring.</p>
<p class="null-p">According to what Riku had heard from the boss at his part-time job, the house was finally taken over by a Tokyo-based relative of the late owner, and the new owner's daughter would be living there during summer vacation. Thus, the boss had requested that he started to deliver newspapers there again.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared that the girl, like Riku, was a middle schooler.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, she was a princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku had delivered the evening newspapers, and was on his way back to the shop when his bicycle passed the brook.</p>
<p class="null-p">He braked hard and stopped before the girl. The girl's slender shoulders shuddered as she watched him warily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, it was because of his standoffish demeanour.</p>
<p class="null-p">In silence, he grabbed a branch, scaled the tree, reached the straw hat with the white ribbon tied to it, and nudged it over to the wide-eyed girl below.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her petite white hands hurriedly caught the straw hat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku hopped off the tree and landed on the patch of grass dyed in orange. The girl, still very tense, clutched the straw hat to her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Erm..."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was about to say something, but he had already leapt onto the bicycle parked by the side of the path, and pedalled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was unused to communicating with others, let alone those who would not have any relation to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">To him, she looked like a moneyed princess from Tokyo. But he did hold some curiosity towards her, for she was a relative of the lonely 'fairy'.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐I am a fairy.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had happened two years ago, in summer, when Riku had been in his first year of the middle school.</p>
<p class="null-p">He took his painting utensils and walked into the forest by the village, intending to draw the marshes there.</p>
<p class="null-p">She, Shiori Hamuro, was old enough to be called an elderly lady. Her hair was white, and the flow of time had carved scars on her little face.</p>
<p class="null-p">That did not hinder her in the slightest, however. There was a lush patch of grass between the massive trees and she sat there, on the edge, in a blue dress, back straight, knees of her thin legs held together. All very elegant. There was something sacred in her innocent smile and her voice sounded gentle and warm. She looked completely unlike the depiction of her painted by the villagers, one of a lonely, hopeless, senile old lady.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐The Princess of the Hamuros has been the prettiest in the village once, but she never got married and grew to be spinster. Her family has passed away, that the old house is the only inheritance she has left. Such a pity. Why didn't she marry? There were rumors that she was duped by a bad man, and dumped. But she's a daughter of a rich family, and so pretty to begin with. Why is it that nobody has proposed to her?</p>
<p class="null-p">He had heard plenty of rumors like those, and more.</p>
<p class="null-p">But none of it mattered to Riku. So he just lowered his head and turned to leave, only to hear Shiori speak with an elegant singing voice,</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐So you can really draw? That is good. This place is said to be the most beautiful place in the world. Especially during summer nights, when those who come here turn into fairies and cowherds.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was the warm breeze, the rustling greenery, the pure white clouds floating in the sky, the clear light shining upon the land.</p>
<p class="null-p">The diminutive old lady, that stood amidst the vibrant wildforest at noontime, only spoke of whimsical things. However, there was an adorable presence surrounding her, a rather refreshingly peculiar one.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, one might think that she was a real fairy.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while, he recovered and found himself thinking that the summer sun remained strong and a blurring of consciousness could be a symptom of heatstroke. The temperature here was falling, but it was still probably better to rehydrate in the shade and head back home before the sun set completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment Shiori narrowed her eyes and said, "thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku turned around and left, sent on his way by a song sung in a gentle voice. He heard words like "apple flowers", "Katyusha", and so on. It appeared to be a foreign folk song… Its upbeat melody was swaying gently in the wind accompanied by the fragrance of the green forest .</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku only had that one conversation with Shiori, and never went back to that place again.</p>
<p class="null-p">For him, that clearing was simply an arts classroom during the period of the school break. For Shiori, it seemed to be something altogether more sacred. Riku felt that an outsider should not trespass there callously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori did place an order for the morning newspaper, and Riku would deliver them into the postbox of that house covered by lush greenery. But the days passed by and he never met Shiori again.</p>
<p class="null-p">He tried to recall the face of the fairy, and reconcile it with the girl with the straw hat, but the age gap between them was too great, and he couldn't tell if they really resembled each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like it had happened with Shiori, it was unlikely that he would meet the girl again.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, Riku returned to his two-storey wooden apartment, eschewed dinner as usual, and spent the time sketching in the empty room.</p>
<p class="null-p">The space was six tatami big, and he was kneeling upon the faded floor as he drew everything he saw on anything he could draw upon, whether it was the back of a pamphlet, the bottom of an empty box, or the back of a school contact list. With bated breath, he let the charcoal pencil fly, and purged everything other than the act of drawing from his world.</p>
<p class="null-p">His mother probably would not be back tonight. Nobody would disturb him. The sweat gathering on his forehead trickled down his cheeks, falling upon the tatamis, but he paid it no mind as he continued to draw.</p>
<p class="null-p">His next meeting with the girl was the following morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning sun was vaguely peeking out from behind the mountainside and the skies slowly turned brighter. This was the moment when Riku arrived at the house by the brook, the temporary residence of the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">He picked up the still warm newspaper and was about to insert it into the postbox by the fence when he heard a loud bang from the direction of the house. He lifted his head, and saw the girl on the second floor, holding the window in her raised arms. She was staring wide-eyed, straight at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today she was dressed in mint-green pajamas and glasses but, surely, it was the girl from the previous day.</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as their eyes met, she hurriedly lowered the window, and hid.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she think he was dropping by to peep on her?</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Riku felt like he did something bad, and hurriedly drove away from the fence of the residence.</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day, the girl was standing by the postbox dressed in a plain, one-piece dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">That morning she was not wearing glasses and her little white hands were clutching the hem of her dress. She looked extremely tense.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once she sensed Riku's arrival, her back straightened out of fear, and her cheeks reddened.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she started to fidget, alternating between averting her eyes and looking back at him. Only when Riku parked the bicycle before the postbox did she lift her head up high, and suddenly bent her back down.</p>
<p class="null-p">The long, straight hair immediately fell down her petite shoulders.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My-my straw hat landed on the tree two days ago, and you helped me while</p>
<p class="null-p">I was wondering how to get it down. Thank you very much for doing that...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice was a little shrill, very shy even, but she did her best to say her words, and lowered her head with great sincerity.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a princess living at this villa, and yet she was extremely humble. This was a shock to Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fine threads of hair were draped by the side of her white cheeks, her eyebrows slumped weakly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still skeptical, Riku pulled out a newspaper from his bicycle. The girl timidly reached out to receive them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much," she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment the long slender fingers touched the paper, something caused them to shiver. Riku's heart too seemed to sense this shiver, for a warm sensation rose up his abdomen, so he nodded slightly, and hurriedly pedalled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he thought of the ethereal eyes watching him leave, his breathing turned more frantic than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">(She waited for me just to say thanks... Such an earnest person.) Surely, she was raised well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body still looked immature, but her lips were fine and pink. That appearance etched itself into Riku's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The demure little face truly resembled the fairy he had met in the marsh that summer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since then, the girl at the villa would await Riku's arrival.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each time, she would be holding a flowering can, pretending to water the plants in the garden, only to peek out of the gate every now and then. As soon as she spotted him, she would shrug, lower the watering can, and bashfully emerge from inside the villa grounds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go-Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she would lower her head and greet him politely.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku would hand over the newspaper while remaining seated on the bicycle and the slender hands would slowly reach forth to accept it carefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you," she would say, lowering her head again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl would then lift her head to look at him with noticeable bashfulness in her black eyes and vivid red staining her cheeks. This would make Riku blush too, and he would head off to his next stop with a lowered head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The same scene would play out on the following day.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the day after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl would always wander around within the fenced-off villa grounds, regularly poking her head out of the gate. Whenever Riku's bicycle showed up on its slow approach, she would head out of the gate to wait by the postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the fourth morning, Riku arrived to deliver as usual, but the girl was not there.</p>
<p class="null-p">(She isn't around today...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">He was downhearted and could feel his own disappointment.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Maybe she was really just watering the flowers all the time, and not waiting for me after all.)</p>
<p class="null-p">That thought made him feel really empty. He held the newspaper in his hand. His lips pursed as he lifted his head towards the window on the second floor. The girl had showed her petite face there once. There was much longing in his eyes as he turned to look in that direction, and then, suddenly -</p>
<p class="null-p">- The main door to the house opened. The girl hastily stumbled out of the corridor with a straw hat on her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sun had yet to rise, so why was she wearing the straw hat?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was still early. Where was she intending to go?</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku sensed that she might have some important plans for today. Was she breathing heavily because of that?</p>
<p class="null-p">Doubt gripped his heart and, at the same time, he wondered if the girl would realize that he was looking forward to seeing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-sorry. Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl held down the straw hat with one hand, and bent down to offer her greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice was as soft, as usual. If Riku did not strain his ears, it could have slipped away with the wind, and he would have missed those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">He lowered his head deeper than usual, and quickly handed the newspaper over.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl reached with her hands to receive them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the conversation ended, Riku pedalled off, leaving the girl behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">(That girl is definitely waiting at the courtyard every morning just to meet me, right?) he thought, yet he couldn't quite make himself accept that it could be true.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Why was she wearing a straw hat?)</p>
<p class="null-p">So he focused on the completely unimportant question istead. Then came the next morning, this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">(It's raining today. Will she be waiting even in this weather?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku was wearing a raincoat, and the rain happily pattered against its surface. Visibility was poor. He could only watch his path through narrowed eyes as he rode onwards, making his way forward with much difficulty as he delivered the newspapers into the postboxes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Eventually, he arrived at the villa by the brook and was taken aback. The girl was waiting at the gate this morning as well, holding a red umbrella in one hand. Blue, clumsy looking boots covered her slender legs. They did not fit those legs at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the girl spotted Riku, a faint smile danced on her lips, part-delight and part-bashfulness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing that, the usually poised Riku felt his heart thumping loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">(She's here today.)</p>
<p class="null-p">That caused his heart to race and his body to heat up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku handed the newspaper over, and spoke to her, his tone sounding strangely aloof even to himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Why are you waiting...for the newspaper, every day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl seemed to be rattled. She looked down at her feet and brought the umbrella handle close to her flat chest. Then, while her fingers awkwardly fidgeted around, she replied in a teeny-weeny voice, "I am interested...in the serialized novel."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks and collarbone were beetroot red. The raindrops pelted the umbrella and the raincoat threatening to overpower the girl's already soft voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Novel?" asked Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl nodded back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ye-yes. I want to read the next installment as soon as possible, even a minute sooner if possible…"</p>
<p class="null-p">She lowered her eyes, trying her best to keep the conversation going.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that, in turn, made Riku listen with bated breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That novel is...really interesting... It feels warm, happy, everyone gets along well..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The tips of the girl's elegant lips rose slowly, forming a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It describes a wonderful family..."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's gentle smile and genial voice caused Riku's heart to skip a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, he felt a sharp pain of anguish, and sweetness, and lots of other conflicting emotions ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">- he muttered an emotionless response.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl continued to smile, her happiness genuine and clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku averted his eyes and stepped on the pedal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It must be tough for you to have to deliver even on rainy days...! Please take care of yourself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The slightly old-fashioned words mixed with the murmur of the rain caught up with him as he was leaving.</p>
<p class="null-p">A feeling of warmth spread over his face. It lingered there even though the spacious skies above remained heavy with leaden clouds of rain.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku never read the serialized novel.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way he would know anything about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">But he saw the girl being so elated, and the novel might certainly be as she described it - one depicting a harmonious, happy family. Since she was looking forward to the novel every morning, she was surely living in such a warm, kind family.</p>
<p class="null-p">That must have been why she looked and sounded so clean and gentle, without a hint of malice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku imagined the girl reading. The room was filled with gentle lights, and she was kneeling on the floor, the newspaper laid out, her eyes sparkling as she followed the story. Next to her, there was a warm, gentle presence. Riku could feel that presence just by imagining the scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, he was growing increasingly convinced that he should not interfere with the girl's life and his pursed lips squeezed shut tighter than before.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">(He spoke to me for the first time.)</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy with the raincoat wrapped around him pedalled off. Chise watched the slender, feeble, immature looking back vanish in the rain. She embraced the newspaper and the umbrella handle firmly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks were scalding.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had just received her newspaper and spoke to the boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Maybe he might find it weird however, since I have been waiting for him every morning...)</p>
<p class="null-p">The boots on Chise's feet had been borrowed from the housekeeper, Andousan. She trudged across the damp mud in the overly large footwear and returned to the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">(But even so, I am happy.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise recalled the deep voice that rumbled in her ears, and her heart raced.</p>
<p class="null-p">Over the week, Chise had been at the gate every morning, waiting for the boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Initially, she had worried that if she kept waiting for the boy like this every day, he might feel perturbed, or even weirded out by her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But when the sunlight showed itself from behind the peak, Chise would naturally wake up, and loiter around at the garden with the watering can, fiddle with the cucumber vines, or pinch at the tomatoes, waiting for the sounds of the bicycle arriving.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, looking down the path, she would see the skinny boy with cold eyes riding on the bicycle all the way to the postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would hurry over to him, and gingerly receive the newspaper with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go-good morning.Thank you very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">A polite bow and greeting from her, a quiet bow from him, and he would leave again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The more frequent it got, the bolder Chise started to feel. At times, she would wonder whether it would be unnatural for her to not go out on this day since she had been receiving the newspaper in person every morning. That would, unwittingly, cause her to brood, and she would keep struggling with it alone in her room.</p>
<p class="null-p">But in the end, her desire to meet him would triumph, and she would skip out to the courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the second and third day, she could see that he was somewhat shocked by her actions. But on the fourth, Chise accidentally overslept. She was late, so she snatched the straw hat to cover her messy hair and huffed and puffed hurrying to the outside. The boy had parked his bicycle before the postbox and was looking up towards her room.</p>
<p class="null-p">He seemed to be wondering why she hadn't showed up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once the boy noticed her, he hastily looked aside, and would not look her in the eyes when he handed the newspaper over.</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked more aloof than usual, but yet, somehow, it seemed that he was being shy.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Was he, waiting for me...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise felt her heart throb as she thought that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still looking more aloof than usual, the boy reached out with his tanned, lanky arm and handed over the still-warm newspaper.</p>
<p class="null-p">A simple touch alone caused warmth to spread from her fingertips, and her lips naturally bloomed into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">The freshly printed pages surely felt warm. The boy would sort them before the sky was bright, lay them into the basket and on the backseat of his bicycle, and then deliver them to countless households. Did he too watch the rays of sunlight appear from beyond the peak like glowing shafts of arrows illuminating the ground as he cycled?</p>
<p class="null-p">She watched the silhouette of his back fade away with those thought at the back of her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Chise laid out the newspaper on the floor, and would continue to look at the words and photos printed on the pages until Andou-san's call for breakfast from downstairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">She saw news of a building fire near a certain train station at Tokyo resulting in major delays, and was inadvertently worried as a result. When she saw that a Japanese player did well at a world tennis tournament, she cheered. When she saw news of a puppy saved from a flowing river, she beamed heartily.</p>
<p class="null-p">She read the 4-koma, and chuckled. She read the unexpected developments of the serialized novel, and her palms covered in sweat. There were many questions in the life advice column, like "There is a graveyard being built next door and I still have a 35-year long mortgage on my house. What do I do?", "My boyfriend is being transferred to the Galapagos Islands. Should I go along?" and Chise started to wonder seriously what she should do if these events were to happen to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise also loved to spread the pamphlets out like a fan, inspecting them one by one.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked at them with excitement, muttering to herself, "ah, the green peppers seem cheaper today... There is an exhibition of Kyushu produce at the department store. The instant dangos look delicious. And red beans poured on piping hot sweet potatoes too... Ah, there's a doll festival of the local mascots at the top floor."</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, she had never experienced visiting a supermarket or a convenience store, but just looking at the pamphlet alone was enough for her imagination to go wild. The thin grey paper had a faint fragrance similar to that of the newspaper's and everything printed on those pages represented a vast world Chise knew nothing of. There were various opinions and thoughts published inside, none of them being what Chise expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">For such things to be happening in the outside world.</p>
<p class="null-p">For such major events to actually have happened in the past.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was unlikely that Chise would encounter and experience most of the incidents described, so reading about them made her gasp.</p>
<p class="null-p">(News are interesting.)</p>
<p class="null-p">From that day on Chise watched all the TV programmes, and even in them, she found various delights and new discoveries.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was amazed by the multitude of TV channels and began to watch various different fantasy shows.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would also get into a habit of cutting out clippings of her favorite news or advertisements, and pasting them into a sketchbook.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she would use signature pens with pastel colors to write down her thoughts, or would put stickers of animals or cakes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just thinking about these alone caused her to feel elated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, before writing to her parents or friends, Chise would always check the sketchbook. By doing so, paragraphs like-</p>
<p class="null-p">"Dad, mom, I am feeling energetic every day. I am enjoying myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">-would come naturally with no pretense in those words. Every morning, Chise would be happily waiting by the postbox, waiting for the boy riding the bicycle. She was always looking forward to opening the newspaper the boy delivered, and for every article she read, for every clipping she pasted, she felt a heartfelt bond with the boy, which delighted her to no end.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the boy had talked to her!</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise kept flipping the pages, her thoughts returning to that moment over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">-...Why, are you waiting...for the newspaper, every day?"</p>
<p class="null-p">His voice was deep, mature.</p>
<p class="null-p">The raindrops flowed down the cap of the raincoat, and the expression hidden beneath looked colder than usual. Chise's heart was jumping madly, and she answered that she was interested in the serialized novel.</p>
<p class="null-p">-That novel is...really interesting...it feels warm, happy, everyone gets along well...</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, that was right.</p>
<p class="null-p">The newspaper the boy delivered did contain such a wonderful story.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was set amidst the old streets of post-War Japan, and the family described in it was full of kindred feelings, warm and calming, yet grasping at Chise's heartstrings. Their everyday life was so...</p>
<p class="null-p">Her pink lips smiled on her own.</p>
<p class="null-p">-It talks of a wonderful family…</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise muttered that phrase again, warmth filling her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">-...Is that so?</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy's answer was emotionless and he cycled off while ignoring the rain falling on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I spoke to the delivery boy)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was simply elated by this.</p>
<p class="null-p">(How old is he? What is his name?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she realized, she was thinking only about him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The newspaper boy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"He-he appears to be...a high school boy. Is he a part-timer?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise dug into the mushroom omelette, stammering as she questioned Andou-san. The woman smiled and replied without hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That should be Riku-kun, I guess."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riku-kun...?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So the boy was Riku-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise carefully stored the name in her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riku-kun is not a high school student, though. He's a third year of the middle school, just like you, Chise-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">(We are in the same year!)</p>
<p class="null-p">The delight could melt her cheeks, filling up her heart along with the surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy looked so mature and poised, that Chise had mistakenly assumed him to be older by a year or two. Unexpectedly, he was a ninth-grader, just like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even then, Chise could not possibly become his classmate, for she studied at a girls school. Her heart was beating madly all the same, though.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku had no father, and lived alone with his mother. He had been delivering newspapers since the first year of middle school, to earn some extra income for the family.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was an honest, admirable boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise too found Riku to be pretty independent.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun is the same year as me, but is already working for his mother...his mother needs him, and he became his mother's support...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Even without a father, he could live on with his mother, both of them depending on each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, Chise imagined a kind, happy family.</p>
<p class="null-p">-It talks of a wonderful family…</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, just like the happy family depicted in the newspaper's serialized story.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's heart started to fill with warmth again, but there was some loneliness there too.</p>
<p class="null-p">She finished her breakfast. The rain outside remained strong. She looked out of the window, reminiscing about Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun should be done delivering newspapers…) How did he spend the summer vacation?</p>
<p class="null-p">Did he go out to play with friends?</p>
<p class="null-p">He always had his lips pursed. His eyes looked so cold and mature all the time. Was he able to smile in front of his family and friends?</p>
<p class="null-p">(How does Riku-kun look when he smiles…?)</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wish to say a few more words...to Riku-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The summer downpour kept drenching the window pane. The trees in the garden, the fence, and the postbox all stood quietly looking so forlorn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to say a few more words to Riku-kun…"</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as she said this, Chise felt like someone was eavesdropping on her and, shocked, she instinctively looked towards the door with a blush.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ti-time to hurry with the assignments. Sooner I finish, the earlier I can play."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise faked her usual good mood as she muttered to herself, and looked towards the desk again. At that moment, the cellphone on the shelf suddenly came alive and chimed an uplifting melody.</p>
<p class="null-p">She picked it up, had a look at the screen, gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a trembling voice, she muttered, "Mother…"</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're alone, Arimura?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The day after the rain it was sunny ever since morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku finished delivering the newspapers and went to school. His homeroom teacher was a veteran, and immediately frowned once he saw Riku enter the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the last day of the career guidance tripartite meeting period.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before the summer vacation had started, Riku had received a notice that a guardian was to accompany him to school. Riku had left it on the table for his mother to see, but given her state, one had to wonder if she actually had.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe she even had, but even then, she would probably have forgotten about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">That had always been the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is your mother too busy with work?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The homeroom teacher knew of Riku's family circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been Riku's homeroom teacher back when Riku had been in seventh grade. He made a family visit to Riku's house then, an old apartment. Riku's mother came back home late at night.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once she saw the teacher seated in the living room, she slurred a question.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh my, sensei? Did Riku do anything bad? How weird. Riku is a serious boy unlike me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The woman reeked of alcohol, and she kept hammering at the teacher. Then, she just fell asleep on the tatami with the fading makeup still on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku just laid a blanket over her body. Seeing this, the teacher showed neither excessive pity nor much annoyance.</p>
<p class="null-p">All he said was, "if anything happens, come talk to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since then, the parent-teacher talks would only involve Riku and the homeroom teacher.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, hearing the teacher's question that morning, Riku merely muttered, "she's not at home now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">The teacher gave him a serious look, but did not pursue the matter further and just had Riku sit down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's mother was often busy for various reasons, but never because of work. Whenever she left home for longer, nobody could guess when she would return.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's teacher knew this very well.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Riku sat opposite his teacher.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Arimura, have you been eating well?" asked the man nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku answered tersely. The teacher nodded in approval, brought out the progress plans Riku had submitted and proceeded to the matter at hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You filled in just one desired option."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...That's the only public school I can study at."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Given your grades, you can try for any school. Why not aim for a private high school? We can give you a recommendation to attend Izumigaoka."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Never thought about it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The discussion ended soon after that. Riku lowered his head and bowed before leaving the classroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the afternoon, and the corridors during the summer vacation were rather quiet, but there still were a few students here and there attending club activities. There was the sound of clashing bamboo swords coming from the gym, or balls bouncing, or even the rare faint chirpings of the crickets.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku arrived at the arts classroom near the gym, situated at the first floor. It was also the room of the Arts Club.</p>
<p class="null-p">The middle school Riku attended mandated that all students had to join a club, so Riku joined that one.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a canvas on the rack, with half-done scenery drawn on the surface. It was the path Riku had to pass every morning when he delivered the newspapers, and the hills behind it on the horizon.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku sat on the chair, picked up a brush, and started applying colors.</p>
<p class="null-p">Initially, he wanted to draw a morning scenery.</p>
<p class="null-p">But for some reason, the colors on the canvas turned out to have the palette of a sunset.</p>
<p class="null-p">-Given your grades, you can try for any school. Why not aim for a private high school? We can give you a recommendation to attend Izumigaoka.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/riku-and-chise_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Izumigaoka High School was the only one with an arts module in this area, which was probably why the teacher asked. He surely must have seen Riku drawing alone in the arts classroom after school, or during the breaks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku liked to draw.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the moment he could think for himself, he had not involved himself with soccer, baseball or video games. Instead, he had spent his childhood drawing pictures everywhere, even on the back of adverts or on the dirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely it was because this form of entertaining himself did not require money and he could keep playing alone. Whenever Riku drew, he could focus to the point of ignoring the existence of the surrounding noises, voices, time, or even himself. That was why he loved to draw.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever he started to draw, he would turn oblivious to whether his mother was home, or even forget his meals. Many times, he found it was morning by the time he was done.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku really wanted to keep drawing, but he had to stop and go out to deliver newspapers. Whenever he left home, he would feel something was being torn out from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to draw more.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to keep drawing for entire days.</p>
<p class="null-p">If possible, he wanted to attend a school with an arts module.</p>
<p class="null-p">As the teacher had said, given his grades, surely he could get a recommendation to Izumigaoka.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the family finances would not allow for him to attend a private high school. Izumigaoka in particular was really far away and an exorbitant amount of money would be required for commuting alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever his mother found a new lover, she would not return to the apartment. Thus, Riku had to find his own way to earn a living for those periods. So far he had barely managed to scrape by with the salary earned from delivering newspapers and he knew very well Izumigaoka was not a school he could attend.</p>
<p class="null-p">He faced the canvas, flicking his wrist, and nearly forgot to breathe. For him, moments like this one were the 'real reality'.</p>
<p class="null-p">From time to time, he could hear the energetic yells, the sounds of the bouncing balls, or the clashing sounds of the bamboo blades. However, while Riku was alone in the arts classroom, the room became so tranquil it seemed to be secluded from the world outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Riku focused on applying colors. At this moment, someone suddenly opened the door with a loud bang.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you're here after all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Witha a noise so loud that it caused ears to ring, a girl ran into the classroom. A closer look at her clothes revealed that the hem of her blouse and skirt were shortened.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was Ozaki Suzuka, Riku's classmate.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl had short hair, waxed to keep it fixed in position. Her eyelashes were long and curly. At school, she was considered to be eye-catching, trendy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since the two of them had became classmates in their third year of middle school, she kept clinging to him. Truth be told, however, Riku did not want to get too involved with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You had a parent-teacher meeting today, so I thought you'll come to the arts classroom. I was right!" she said with glee, opening her bright red lips and mouth wide with every word.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wondered how did she know that his appointment had been set for today, but he said nothing. He rather disliked interacting with others, let alone people like Suzuka who would intrude on other people without a second thought. She was the kind of person he had the most difficulty handling.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, he remained silent and kept drawing. Suzuka paid no attention to Riku's attitude as she took the initiative to head to his side, brought her face close to the canvas, and stared at his work.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the path by the brook, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm, sure seems like it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This looks like the entrance to the forest. Am I right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"This sunset looks really pretty. I love the sunset, when the sun's about to disappear, the clouds glow, and the skies turn pink."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku showed no reaction to anything Suzuka had said. The girl lost her patience and brought her face close to Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Arimura," she muttered, "you're always drawing scenery or still art. You haven't drawn a person before. You are not very interested in people, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you want me to be your model? I can let you draw me right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...No need."</p>
<p class="null-p">If Riku was to remain silent, Suzuka might really end up posing on the table, so he forced himself to reply while facing the canvas, not lifting his head up.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Just go back.)</p>
<p class="null-p">He swallowed those words, barely holding back from giving them voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka puffed her cheeks up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do you say that? Why are you so annoying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">(If you find me annoying, just leave.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku had no intention of being alone with a person he could not get along with.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka continued to bend over and she leaned towards Riku slowly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You always keep a frown, Arimura. You look gloomy and bored, your eyes are cold. I've never seen you smile before. Have you never felt happy in your life?" she grumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Riku just felt she was sticking her nose where she wasn't wanted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing to do with you, Ozaki."</p>
<p class="null-p">"See, you're so cold when you talk. I don't mind, but any other girl would cry. That's why you have no friends. If you keep this attitude while looking for a job, I bet that you'll fail your first round of interviews."</p>
<p class="null-p">(I don't have anything to do with you,) Riku thought impatiently, (so just...) Suzuka smiled once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So I want you to be a little happier. Try drawing me. Make me pose however you like."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku continued to scowl. Suzuka would not budge.</p>
<p class="null-p">So he decided to just let her continue talking and keep ignoring her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say something already!", she yelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">His mother was an emotional person, prone to random episodes of smiling and hollering, or sudden outbursts of rage, only to bawl her eyes out and cup her shoulders soon after.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever his mother was not at home, the cramped two room apartment seemed exceptionally quiet. Whenever his mother broke up with men however, the room got rowdy the very moment she reached home.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka really resembled Riku's mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or perhaps was it that all women were so boisterous and prone to mood swings?</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku kept applying orange colors of the sunset to the branch filled with rich green leaves. At the same time, his mind thought of the white ribbon fluttering in the air.</p>
<p class="null-p">(If it's the girl from the cottage…)</p>
<p class="null-p">An apprehensive smile appeared in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was unlike the women Riku knew, different, serene and innocent.</p>
<p class="null-p">He recalled the fairy he had seen by the brook in the forest. There were hints of that fairy in that girl with long flowing black hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just this morning, she was again waiting apprehensively at the entrance for Riku, and upon seeing him, bashfully approached the postbox, reached with her delicate hands, and received the newspaper.</p>
<p class="null-p">--Thank you.</p>
<p class="null-p">She thanked her with that teeny-weeny voice of hers, and then slowly lifted her head, as if waiting for him to speak up.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it had been that gentle, demure girl, if both of them were together, the atmosphere would be peaceful. Riku would never be annoyed hearing her soft, delicate voice. Even if it happened over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka continued to yap away next to him, but he ignored her callously. Unwittingly, he thought back to the girl wearing that straw hat. He wondered what he should say to her. Of course, he knew very well she was a princess of a high standing who was spending her summer holiday in a vintage residence, attended by a helper. She was not a person he could easily approach.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What...is that girl doing now?)</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">With a serious look, Chise flipped over the pudding cup and put the contents on the plate.</p>
<p class="null-p">What dropped out of the container was not pudding, but something with three layers of color - green, pink, and yellow. Once she saw the thing land perfectly onto the plate, she broke into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is done."</p>
<p class="null-p">She had prepared it according to a recipe published in the newspaper, one for a summer appetizer jelly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The layers were green okra, pink crab meat, and yellow sweet pepper.</p>
<p class="null-p">The completed jelly was vibrant in color, dazzling, and cute. Chise heaved a sigh of relief, and Andou-san too couldn't take her eyes off it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, how pretty," she marvelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was lunchtime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had requested for Andou-san to allow her the use of the kitchen to make the dish. Outwardly, it appeared to be a success.</p>
<p class="null-p">The plate ended up containing the jelly, salad made from spinach and cherry tomatoes, and the chicken mushroom quiche Andou-san had baked the previous day. The meal was topped off by a freshly baked baguette and honey. It was served with mixed vegetable juice, and the after-meal drink would be warm milk tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truly it was the best of lunches.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise picked up the fork, cut off a bit of the jelly, and placed it into her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Delicious…"</p>
<p class="null-p">The ingredients were mixed in correct proportions, just as described in the recipe, which made it all the more delicious. The natural sweetness of the vegetables and crab gradually melted away on the tongue, and the smooth texture certainly helped the taste.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the summer heat went along very well with the cooling saltiness, making it even more delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">She cut the piping hot baguette in half, and ate it together with the jelly. The interplay of hotness and coldness sharpened the sweetness of the crab.</p>
<p class="null-p">(In the next letter to Father and Mother I shall write that I made a delicious dish for lunch, and that I want them to taste it.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise thought of how she had another 'wonderful experience' she could to report to her parents, her cheeks blooming with joy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san was all smiles watching her through narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll make a wonderful wife when you grow older, Chise-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I simply followed the recipe from the newspaper. It is easy to understand, and anyone can easily follow it. It is really helpful," replied the girl shyly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank goodness I had the shop deliver the newspaper every day. You really like to read them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise could not reply with her real reason, that she was looking forward to seeing Riku deliver the newspaper every morning, so her voice got shrill when she said, "y-yes...Father always bought four different newspapers to read...so I am interested in them…"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is an amazing interest to have.'</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's shoulders sagged under her blushing cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your parents should be here for summer vacation now, no? Hopefully they have the time to come read newspapers and enjoy themselves."</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san's careless words caused Chise's heart to be gripped by a vise, and the hand holding the spoon suddenly started to feel stone-cold and stone-still.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I have to smile.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks did their utmost to obey the thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise helped Andou-san clear the cutlery, put on the straw hat, took the letter and the postcard she had written the previous day, and went for a stroll.</p>
<p class="null-p">She passed the fence, the sight of the red postbox on the other side made her smile. Green grass grew by the side of the soft brown path outside the villa, so she was wearing her slippers for this outing.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky was clear and cloudless, a dream of a weather compared to the downpour the previous day. The sun was high up over horizon, but was not as violently scorching as when walking the on the asphalts of Tokyo.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's rays after the rain looked brighter than ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">For every step she took, her dress would be ruffled by a pleasant breeze, and her hair would flutter before her chest. The gusts of wind blew at her neck, and it felt really comfortable.</p>
<p class="null-p">The vineyards and farms Chise passed by were all sceneries Chise had discovered on her first day here. She watched the fields excitedly as she slowly advanced down along the brook.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she finally reached the asphalt path. There were a few shops here, a convenience store, a rice shop, a newsagent, and a postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise slipped the letter through the slit, and walked away. She would wander like this for a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once she was tired, she went to a nearby tree to rest.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she took out the bottle of mineral water she bought from the vending machine.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This might be rather inelegant of me...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise looked around to see if anyone was watching, before bringing the PET bottle to her lips, and taking a large gulp. The icy fluid moistened her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just mineral water, yet it tasted especially sweet to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was really delicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">She brought the cool PET bottle to her scalding cheeks, and they felt better immediately. It felt comfortable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she slipped the bottle into the cloth bag slung over her shoulder, and walked off again.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the way, she saw a bus stop. She stopped, and had a look at the timetable. There was only one bus per hour or so. Andou-san had said previously that it would take her to the city, which had a department store and a cinema.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Does Riku-kun go to movies...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">And again, Chise was thinking about Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever she did so, she felt something sweet and beautiful fill her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was still early.</p>
<p class="null-p">(If I go to where I met Riku-kun for the first time, will I meet him again...?) Of course, such coincidences did not happen on demand.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the moment Chise thought about it, she felt elated. She made her way back along the asphalt to the dirt path, and advanced down the brook again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The clear river water trickled between the rocks, whispering of pleasant coolness that made her nearly forget the summer afternoon heat.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she almost reached the forest where she had met Riku on the day her straw hat had been carried to the tallest, thickest tree, suddenly...</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a gust of wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's straw hat was nearly blown away, again, but she managed to hurriedly hold it down with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">The wind rattled the trees revealing a tanned, skinny boy with a mature expression that seemed to stand in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But once the wind stopped, she saw there was no one there.</p>
<p class="null-p">It made her feel despondent.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, the clear sunlight beamed through the trees and the breeze continued to the caress the leaves gently. Chise looked up at the tree of the hat, recalled how the white ribbon had once been dangling from its top, and smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">She approached it slowly, wrapped her arms around it, and leaned her ear against the bark.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could barely hear what seemed to be water flowing inside the thick trunk.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the sound of a tree.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This tree is alive...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, this tree would remember the day she had met Riku. And not just that day and the two of them. There had been many more people who had rested under its shade, or passed by its trunk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise herself had lived for a mere 15 years, and this tree had lived at least ten times that. She listened to the pulse of the tree, her sadness slowly seeping away. She was calm again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The previous day, her mother had contacted her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She reminded Chise that while the girl could enter college without needing to sit through exams, Chise should not be slacking off in her studies. Then she added one more thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Your father and I are discussing certain matters. We will notify you of any developments.</p>
<p class="null-p">She ended the call with that line.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was this 'development'? The word made her heart freeze. Chise's parents had intended for her to spend the summer vacation at the villa, and she had a feeling she knew what was happening.</p>
<p class="null-p">But...</p>
<p class="null-p">By closing her eyes and embracing the warm tree trunk, she felt she could make her sadness be carried away by the water flowing through the tree. (Once I get back to the villa, I will write another letter.) One each to her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">With only happy words full of wonder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a nice place."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It makes me feel happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will be happier if everyone can come here."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku opened the packet containing two slices of bread, and started to nibble on the food as he kept drawing.</p>
<p class="null-p">His uncompromisingly aloof stance made Suzuka exclaim, "none of the other boys ignored me like this!" and storm out of the arts classroom in a huff.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku did not really pay any heed to that. He just kept quietly nibbling away at the bread in his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back when Riku had been doing his sketching at home, he found eating to be too much of a hassle, so he just filled his stomach with bread as a substitute for proper meal. Ever since then, he would sate his hunger with bread whenever he was alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not use butter or jam.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was fine with eating bland stuff, as long as it filled his stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">His mother never once cooked at home, and thus Riku himself was not too picky about the taste of food.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka said that Riku "always looked bored." But he had simply never understood the concept of joy..</p>
<p class="null-p">The joy Riku felt when drawing seemed a little different from the 'joy' his classmates talked of.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart was barely moved by things when he wasn't drawing. Perhaps it was for this reason that he had always looked bored, as Suzuka had said.</p>
<p class="null-p">But to lose control of emotions was a dangerous thing, and it was better for him to remain as he was</p>
<p class="null-p">Back in elementary school, Riku had once experienced outrage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back then, a boy in his class bad-mouthed his mother in a cliché manner. The words used wer nauseating, crude, but the boy was telling the truth. And that enraged Riku all the more, his eyes blazing with flames of hatred.</p>
<p class="null-p">A wild beast seemed to have awakened to run rampant within him, and the next moment, he leapt towards the that classmate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku pinned the offender down, grabbed him by the collar, and slammed two, three punches into the face.</p>
<p class="null-p">One moment, his classmate was so uppity, full of slanderous, filthy words. The next, his head was busted, and he lay shrivelled on the floor, begging for mercy. The other boys, that heaped scorn on Riku just a moment before, too were terrified, and stumbled back.</p>
<p class="null-p">These guys are weak.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after a few years, recalling that incident now, Riku remembered that after calming down, a thought had occurred to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Humans were fragile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Punch them, and they would bleed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And break.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not just physically, but also emotionally.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he wanted to beat the person up, his hands could easily do so. They might even kill.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Riku understood this, he chained his own soul to prevent himself from losing control ever again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since then, no matter what anyone had said about his mother, Riku had only responded with silence. After a long time like that, nothing could rattle his heart easily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Bitterness, pain, sadness, joy, elation, he felt none of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">All that remained in Riku's heart was a desire to draw. At any given moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">He remained alone, in the empty classroom, drawing and thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Soon, he would have to leave the school building, and head to the shop to deliver the newspapers.</p>
<p class="null-p">To deliver the evening newspapers, return home, do some sketching, and go to sleep early so that he could deliver newspapers the next morning...</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku never thought of having ordinary parents, or wanting a luxurious life.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no hopes for his own future.</p>
<p class="null-p">Truth be told, the matter of further studies did not matter to him either.</p>
<p class="null-p">His one wish was to keep drawing, without any distractions.</p>
<p class="null-p">With a stoic look, Riku swallowed the last bit of his bread.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's dinner today was tomato soup Andou-san had cooked, followed by summer vegetables, a large lump of mashed potatoes, mūniēre, and finally, milk-flavored bavarois with lots of muscat grapes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each dish was delicious, especially the bavarois. The well-rounded sweetness filled the mouth with every bite, and so enthralling it was that Chise was reluctant to finish it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Where did you go today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I went to the convenience shop, the rice shop, and the newsagent's..."</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, Andou-san took the initiative in the conversation. Chise did her best to describe what she had seen outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I felt really happy, even though it was just a stroll," said the girl with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I never got to meet Riku-kun, but I went to lots of places. I really enjoyed myself)</p>
<p class="null-p">She had a delightful day.</p>
<p class="null-p">She dropped the cutlery into the washbasin, returned to her room on the second floor, and sat at the desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">The envelope she took from the drawer had refreshing summer motifs - fish, watermelons, and fireworks. Just looking at the illustrations delighted her to no end.</p>
<p class="null-p">On this day too, the desk was laid out with coloring pens, and she pondered which color she should use.</p>
<p class="null-p">The first message of the day was to be written to a good friend from her class. That classmate went to Hawaii this summer vacation with her entire family.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just this afternoon, Chise received a postcard from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The postcard was of a blue ocean, white beach, and coconut trees. The girl wrote, in a neat round handwriting, that she was spending the vacation with her parents, and they were enjoying themselves together.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at the very end of the letter she added one more line.</p>
<p class="null-p">"PS: I'll send you some messages!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise checked her inbox and did indeed find a few photos of her family attached to the messages from her friend. The entire family was dressed in Hawaiian shirts, dancing hula, or eating blue ice pops.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Yuina-chan's parents...have patched things up... Good for you, Yuina-chan.) Chise looked down at the photos, smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐My parents may be having a porce!</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuina, crying her eyes out, had dropped that bombshell on Chise on the first day of their end of terms exams.</p>
<p class="null-p">It started when Chise saw Yuina look all worried after the exams were done for the day.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The comprehension part was really difficult. I did not finish it either," she said, trying to console her friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuina just bawled in reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chise-chan, what do I do now? Papa just had a huge argument with Mama, they want to porce."</p>
<p class="null-p">She sobbed constantly in-between the words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The tea ceremony club activities were suspended for the exam period, so Chise and Yuina went to the clubroom. Having asking about the details, Chise soon learned why Yuina's parents had their argument.</p>
<p class="null-p">On her mother's birthday, Yuina's father unveiled a massage chair with the words, "this is what you wanted, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuina's mother had been hoping for some branded jewellery or a fancy handbag, so seeing this threw her into a fit of rage.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're giving what to your 39-year-old wife for her birthday!? Is this supposed to mean that I'm an old hag who needs a massage chair? That's just what you want! Didn't your mouth water when you saw the message chair at the electronics department store? Didn't you say that you want it? You just bought it for yourself!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What?! Aren't you the one who said, 'This is reeaallly useful' before sitting in it for so long? And when I said it's my turn, weren't you all like 'ah, wait, let me sit a little longer. Ahhhh... This is heeaaaven!'"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This never happened! And where are we going to put such a large machine?! This apartment is so small!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Small?! When we were looking for a house, I said to take the 3LDK at Hikifune, but you were like, 'we're staying in Shirokane'. You're reaching above your worth!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now you're blaming me?! Didn't you agree and say that we'll move once you get promoted?! So?! When are you getting promoted?!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And eventually, in the heat of the argument, her mother blurted out suddenly, "I had enough of you. Let's porce!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Humph! Let's! Once I move out, this house will feel bigger!" snapped back her father.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuina, you'll stand by mama's side, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You'll come with papa, right Yuina?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them turned on the dumbfounded Yuina at once, putting her in a corner. They then told her she would have to decide who she was going to live with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can't choose!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuina bawled again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yuina-chan, do not worry. Your parents are just temporarily cross with each other. They will make amends once they calm down."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise kept encouraging Yuina like this over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, on the final morning of the exams, Yuina was beaming away when she arrived at school. Before Chise could say good morning, Yuina hugged her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They said they won't be porcing!" reported Chise's friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Papa and mama asked me, 'have you decided who do you want to live with?' and I fell to the floor, crying that I want the three of us to live together. They panicked and apologized to me. And said that they're not going to porce after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuina said happily that they decided to go to Hawaii together for the summer vacation. She continued to prattle carelessly, saying things like, "thank goodness papa and mama argued"...</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed the family was enjoying themselves in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in any case, they simply had a little quarrel.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was quietly relieved that Yuina's parents never got porced but, at the same time, she felt a weak sting of pain in her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Yuina's parents are different from mine.)</p>
<p class="null-p">A gentle, graceful father and a mother as pretty as a flower, who would do her nails at the salon once every week.</p>
<p class="null-p">When standing next to each other, the two of them resembled a young couple, but Chise had never seen them quarrel before.</p>
<p class="null-p">According to her memories, their relationship had always been frigid. She could sense that both of them were trying to not talk to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Other parents she could see were always smiling, looking happy, staying</p>
<p class="null-p">close to each other. Why were her parents always scowling and silent?</p>
<p class="null-p">Did father not like mother?</p>
<p class="null-p">Did mother not like father?</p>
<p class="null-p">The young Chise was always worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">The matter of her parents not liking each other was really terrifying to the little girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">What should she do so that they could get along well?</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise kept thinking about it. So much so, that her little head was overheating at times. When she was in the 4th grade, she bought a shiny glass brooch for her mother's birthday. She had the pretty big sister in the shop wrap it real nicely and print her father's name on the card. She then left the package in her mother's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mother would definitely assume it was a present from her father, and maybe, just maybe her parents would start getting along well like other parents did. The whole family might be able to eat together and enjoy a meal happily. The whole family might go out to play together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise went to sleep full of hope. The next morning, when she went to the living room, her mother gave her a red box with a cold look on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the very same little box that contained the brooch Chise had prepared, the one she had bought at the trendy store popular with girls. Once Chise realized this, her little face froze. Her mother spoke with voice as cold as her own face, "this brooch is too juvenile for me. This shall be for you, Chise," she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise felt her body go numb with coldness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mother knew it was her who had given the gift.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now that she thought about it, Chise's father, surely, would not choose this cheap trinket of a glass brooch.</p>
<p class="null-p">And, surely, her mother would not wear such a thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few days later, Chise heard a rare conversation between her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">She woke at night, wanting to use the toilet. While on the corridor, she overheard their voices.</p>
<p class="null-p">She ended up eavesdropping.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you returned the brooch to Chise?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her father seemed to be reproaching her mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise shivered, and inadvertently held her breath as she listened intently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For what occasions exactly do you want me to wear that fake brooch? That child might at least look cute wearing it instead," retorted the woman impatiently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As a mother, you should have pretended not to notice and accept it happily. You cannot even do that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? And what right do you have to be angry? You never went to supervise Chise's school lessons or attend her sports festival. Most of the time, you tend to forget that you have a daughter. Seeing you try to act like a father now is laughable."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lady, you are cold as ice. Terrifyingly so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And you always excuse yourself by criticizing me. Any birthday present you give me is a ruse. Chise will understand when she grows up. Her parents are not a marriage, just registered strangers."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise shivered, and quietly walked away from the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">She returned to her room, ducked under the sheets, and blocked her ears. However, her parents' conversation kept echoing in her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">With each repetition, the heart area oh her chest would tighten, and she would struggle for breath drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's actions had been futile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Moreover, they backfired.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her father rebuked her mother, and her mother was furious at her father.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was all her fault.</p>
<p class="null-p">It is her fault for using father's name to gift mother such a cheap, childish brooch.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had never realized before that mother would only wear real gemstones.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's eyes threatened to tear up, but she willed herself calm with the thought that she should not cry. She bit the edge of her blanket, trying her best to suppress her tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she cried, her eyes would be swollen.</p>
<p class="null-p">If her father saw that she had cried, he would blame her mother, and her mother would think she was a troublesome child.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Right, I cannot cry! I just need to pretend that I did not hear those words.)</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, her parents would not look each other in the eye. The atmosphere in the living room was heavy and dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Chise too was to show a gloomy face, the atmosphere in the family would worsen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, her parents would not wish to stay in such a house.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had to smile and pretend not to know anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Chise maintained a cheerful façade in front of the duo.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps her parents would be happy seeing her like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Yuina-chan and her parents...are all smiling so happily...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she knew it, Chise's hand stopped writing. The photo Yuina had sent was still on her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">A chill started to crawl up her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how cheerful a façade she maintained, Chise's parents would not smile at home.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Maybe it is better...if I do not smile after all.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart was turning colder and colder...</p>
<p class="null-p">She was sad, yet unable to cry...</p>
<p class="null-p">She had desperately prayed in her heart, but now she saw might have been doing it wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she should be as honest as Yuina, and cry her heart out, tell her parents honestly that she still wanted the three of them to be together. Would her parents willing make amends if she did so?</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body was as heavy as lead. If her room were the sea, she would have sunk all the way to the bottom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise looked towards the fish-motif postcard uneasily. At this moment, an upbeat melody suddenly rang from the cellphone on the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Mother!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise recalled the message her mother had delivered the previous day. -We will notify you of any developments.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her past bad feelings were becoming flesh before her very eyes. They wanted Chise alone at the villa, for they did not want her to know what they were discussing.</p>
<p class="null-p">So what was that development?</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise reached for the phone with a trembling hand, and brought it to her ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-hello...Mother?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps, it was be good news.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps, they would reconcile and come to the villa Chise was staying at.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Please, please, let this be the case.)</p>
<p class="null-p">But the cold voice crushed Chise's fleeting wishes the moment it entered her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have spoken to that man. We are definitely porcing. Do think whose family name you'd rather have, Chise."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks, the hand holding the phone, everything froze immediately. ‐‐Papa and mama asked me, 'have you decided who do you want to live with?'</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuina's smile and cheerful tone when she had talked about her parents' porce brouhaha appeared in Chise's mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐I fell to the floor, crying that I want the three of us to live together. They panicked and apologized to me. And said that they're not going to porce after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Chise had cried in front of them...</p>
<p class="null-p">If she had sobbed and choked, saying that she hoped they would not porce, that she hoped for the three of them to live together...</p>
<p class="null-p">Would her mother think about the porce just a little more?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Mother, ‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">(Is it okay for you two not to porce instead?)</p>
<p class="null-p">This was what Chise wanted to say, but her throat suddenly tightened, and she could not force the words out.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ Yuina's parents are different from mine.</p>
<p class="null-p">The undeniable fact was stabbing viciously at Chise's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she wailed and objected, her mother would have just found it annoying.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yuina's parents were on good terms from the start. But Chise's parents were different. They were on bad terms, and never needed Chise.</p>
<p class="null-p">The image of her mother formed in the girl's mind. No matter how she had tried to fawn over her mother, she would be invariably rewarded by a frown and a cold stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, her father was the same...</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise went silent, and her mother's voice remained as harsh as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are an adult now. You can decide on your own, no?" she said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's throat finally managed to eke out some sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I-I understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Such, such feeble words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will get that man to call you."</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, her mother hung up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's phone remained by her ear as she collapsed onto the desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her parents, their expressions aloof, had turned away from each other, leaving her standing between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Weak and helpless.</p>
<p class="null-p">And finally, still facing away from each other, they drifted apart. Chise could not call for them, could not pull them back. All she could do was to feebly watch them go.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just... Drift apart.</p>
<p class="null-p">(They do not need me.)</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why she could not pull them together!</p>
<p class="null-p">They had never listened to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a proverb - "A child is the rope that binds a couple's feelings." But to this couple, she was just a useless baggage…</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise felt utter despair. She couldn't even hold her head up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nobody could see her, yet she could not find the tears to cry. She was heartbroken, and felt herself fall into the deepest, darkest of pits.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riiiikuuuu, open up. It's me."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was night, almost bedtime, but Riku was still up. He was drawing on the back of the advertising leaflets with pencils and could not stop. Until, he heard the knocking from the corridor, along with a sobbing voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku stood up and went to the front door. The slamming did not relent even for a moment during the brief time it took him to reach his destination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riku! Riku-kun! You're at home, right!? Have you abandoned me too!?</p>
<p class="null-p">Stop fooling around! Open up! Or I'll die here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Barely-coherent sobbing voice kept pestering him from the other side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku unlocked the door, and opened it. He was hit by the stench of booze and, then, a pair of cold hands wrapped itself around him. It was a woman with breasts so large, they almost spilled from the tank-top as she leaned onto his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That man two-timed me! He said he was just playing around! That he's getting married to a young girl from work! Terrible!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tepid tears started flowing down Riku's throat and collarbone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku held up his crying mother, closed the door, and locked it.</p>
<p class="null-p">His mother, mother he had not seen in two months who reeked of alcohol, cigarettes, and perfume. It was a familiar scent, scent he had become accustomed to since childhood - the scent of a woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's mother gave birth to him at the young age of 17.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had said that his father had died before he had been born, but he did not know whether it was true or not. The village's rumor mill had it that his mother dated too many people to tell, so many that nobody really knew who his father was.</p>
<p class="null-p">His maternal grandfather had died while his mother had still been in middle school. As for the grandmother, Riku had used to live together with her but she had died when he was just 2 years old. He hardly remembered anything about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since then, Riku had spent his childhood alternating between being in his mother's custody and in the care center.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, he began to attend middle school and work part time delivering newspapers during the morning and evening. It was then that he learned all the life skills he needed to live by himself even with his mother gone for several days.</p>
<p class="null-p">One might say he was more comfortable being alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever his mother had a new boyfriend, she would leave without even taking her set of keys. Luckily, she never brought those men into this 40-ishyear-old apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most of those his mother dated were senior bankers, dentists, architects, so thankfully none of those gigolos had ever abused him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riku, you're all I have left. The one I really love is you, my blood. Everyone else is an outsider."</p>
<p class="null-p">His mother's makeup was completely messed by her tears, and the sticky face was rubbing the mess into Riku's cheeks as she embraced him. Riku found it painful, but he could not push his mother away.</p>
<p class="null-p">All he could do was to maintain this posture until she cried herself to sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku knew this very well, so he gave up on drawing for the night, and let his mother embrace him. He might have to drag his weary sleep-deprived body out to deliver the newspapers tomorrow, but tonight nothing else could be done.</p>
<p class="null-p">His mother bawled still, snot and tears gushing in equal measure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now and then, she would mutter she loves him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mother was in her 30s, but looked to be in her 20s with a bit of makeup and fashionable clothing. She was diminutive, but blessed with curves and beauty. That give her high self-esteem.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, for that she had never learned, and would fall into hopeless relationships time and time again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're all that I have left. I won't go anywhere. I'll stay together with you, Riku. It's decided now!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She would always make such a promise. But, eventually, she would have a new lover again, would leave Riku behind once more, leaving home without taking the key.</p>
<p class="null-p">She needed her son only when she had been dumped. Whenever she had an affair, she would never even think of the fact that she had a son out there.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she had never ever felt guilty for abandoning her own child.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the kind of woman she was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you, Riku. I love you. I love you. I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She proffesed her feelings over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">These words sounded so frivolous.</p>
<p class="null-p">These words sounded so hollow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing them, smelling the stench of booze from his mother's mouth, Rikku dropped his arms and only his empty eyes hinted at the anguish that followed. His limbs became cold, his head heavy, his heart hollow, like a spring that had dried up. No matter how many times his mother swore to love him, her words were empty air.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">(I am not a cute child. I cannot shed a single tear...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise ended her call with her mother, and lowered her head. She put the vibrant rof of color pens back into the plastic pencil case.</p>
<p class="null-p">(That is why I never had a chance to keep Father and Mother together...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, she noticed a pocket knife used to open the envelopes, and she stared intently at it.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much she were to cry, her parents would remain unmoved.</p>
<p class="null-p">But...</p>
<p class="null-p">If she opened her wrists with this knife...</p>
<p class="null-p">Would they both panic over this?</p>
<p class="null-p">Would they then hurry over to this villa instead?</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise could not tear her eyes away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her slender, feeble fingertips were slowly inching towards the lemon-yellow knife.</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened the foldable blade, the steel glinting sharply in the daylight.</p>
<p class="null-p">All this time, she had been able to wield it so easily to cut paper. But once she saw the shiny edge, she became terrified, and goosebumps arose behind her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise put the knife to her wrist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body started to shiver, stronger with every heartbeat.</p>
<p class="null-p">This would not kill her. All it would do was… cause a minor loss of blood. For the sake of conveying her feelings to her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">This toy-like knife could not kill at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, this was fine. All it would do was leave marks on her wrists.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as her parents mended their relationship, she was fine with having scars all over her body!</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise held her breath as she stared at the knife and her wrist. She tried to bring the bade to bear against the blue veins.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would not budge. No matter how much strength she attempted to muster.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am a coward...!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her lips moved in quiet despair.</p>
<p class="null-p">Still holding the blade, and dressed in her usual dress, she lay down on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I cannot cry.)</p>
<p class="null-p">She had kept repeating this silent mantra over and over again, ever since that tragic night when she had overheard the cold dispute between her parents.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was suffering because she could not cry, but these were the first words that arose in her heart whenever she felt sad, and thus, not crying was all she could do.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was unwanted by her parents and never doted on. Her IQ was average. She had no courage. Her existence was worth something only because of her smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not want those around her to feel bad, even if they never liked her. She did not want them to hate her, at the very least. Thus, she had to keep smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">She kept seeking wonderful, happy things.</p>
<p class="null-p">She should not be overly dependent on others, for she would turn into a hindrance, but she had to remain optimistic.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart was hurting, painfully so. Her throat felt as though it was being ripped apart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise grabbed the bedsheet firmly, murmuring hoarsely again and again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have to smile...Smile...Smile...!"</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riku, why do you look so gloomy? Aren't you happy to see me return?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's mother grabbed him by the chest, her face covered with tears as she asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart remained unmoved.</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyes surely looked distant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please, Riku. Just smile...Smile. Riku, why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you being kind to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fingertips topped with scarlet-red nails were shaking him violently.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, his heart remained unmoved.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had no hatred for his mother, held no grudges against her.</p>
<p class="null-p">If a smile was enough to soothe her feelings, get her to release him, and make her obedient, he would like nothing more than to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">But he did not know how to smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Had he ever cracked a decent smile once in his short life?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Smile...Riku, please smile..."</p>
<p class="null-p">His mother's tone was filled with increasing anguish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her words seemed to be cursing him. However, Riku kept on listening as he was, detached and hollow.</p>
<p class="null-p">All he could do was to wonder why, even though his own flesh and blood was next to him, willingly expressing their love for him, did he felt so lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not know how to 'smile'...</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The long night finally started to brighten. Chise slowly got up.</p>
<p class="null-p">She fell asleep without a blanket on. Her body was frigid, her head like stone.</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not remove her contact lenses before she slept, so her eyes were bone-dry, and her eyelids were swollen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, her eyes were bloodshot too.</p>
<p class="null-p">She got off the bed, and dragged her sluggish body out of the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I cannot meet Riku-kun...while looking like this.)</p>
<p class="null-p">She was sure of this without even looking at the mirror. How could she let</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku see her dirty face? Surely he would be shocked by her and disgusted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, it was past the time of Riku's delivery.</p>
<p class="null-p">She entered the washroom, and washed her face with icy water. Her heart felt so heavy, leaden.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put the contact lenses on again. She did not dare to look at herself in the mirror, and kept averting her eyes from the glass the entire time.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Did Riku-kun...deliver the newspapers today too...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">The newspapers she received from Riku's hands were often warm like bread fresh out of the oven.</p>
<p class="null-p">But on this day, the newspaper should have turned cold already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise put on her shoes in the hall, and slowly opened the door.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sun was shining from the other side of the hill, like a blinking arrow of light fired towards Chise, causing her to immediately narrow her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">(The weather is good.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, she would be happier if she was not so sleep-deprived, so downhearted.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the clear morning skies left her all the more despondent.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world did not care for Chise's laments and despair, and continued on as normal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise approached the postbox, intending to withdraw the newspaper.</p>
<p class="null-p">But when she reached it, what she saw stunned her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The newspaper hadn't arrived!</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart immediately tightened.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Today is not a day when they are not publishing... So why?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Such a tragic event had happened to her, yet she did not see the newspaper Riku should have delivered.</p>
<p class="null-p">(God really loves to mess with people,) she thought as her eyebrows started to drop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, she heard the sound of a bicycle's wheels.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed to be approaching. Chise looked in that direction with a gasp.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sun was shining brightly and the long path was dazzling. The bicycle basket and back seat were filled with newspapers. The boy was approaching.</p>
<p class="null-p">He pursed his lips and kept pedalling soaked in sweat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise widened her eyes, as though some sort of miracle was unfolding before her, a brightly colored miracle. She looked at the boy...</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked at Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just a moment ago, she thought her world was about to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it was not being 'destroyed'. It was being 'reborn'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku parked his bicycle by the postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was sweaty and looked more anxious than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">He lowered his head slightly, probably as apology for being late. Then, he took a newspaper from the basket, and handed it to Chise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise looked at Riku in surprise, and received the newspaper.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were really warm.</p>
<p class="null-p">The warm feeling slowly spread through her fingertips, and instantly engulfed Chise's sinking heart, warming it too.</p>
<p class="null-p">The newspaper was so warm. Just a minor thing that left Chise especially elated. She was really delighted to be able to meet Riku at this moment, to receive the newspaper from him. She felt she was being lifted up and away from a dark abyss.</p>
<p class="null-p">She thought she would never be able to smile again. However, her lips naturally bloomed, her dry eyes suddenly moistened, and the color of blood returned to her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise... broke into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was not forcing herself into a febble show of pretended happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was making a heartfelt smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">A happy smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku widened his eyes, looking startled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise said with heartfelt thanks,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku in turned narrowed his eyes as if he was looking straight into the sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">He turned towards Chise again, lowered his head stiffly, and pedalled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">The silhouette of that back slowly faded away. Chise watched him leave as she embraced the warm newspaper tightly, showing a sweet smile able to melt everything.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, Chise wrote a letter to Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">The noon sunlight lit up the desk, and Chise took out her favorite white postcard with a flower attached to it, picked up the adorable lavender colored pen, and - "To Riku-kun</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you for delivering newspapers all the time. It is because of your deliveries that I enjoyed reading them."</p>
<p class="null-p">- in a letter without the recipient address given, she penned down her blissful, sacred feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The newspapers you delivered have always cheered me up, Riku-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yesterday, my world was filled with pain, and it was a really dark, lonely place.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the newspapers you delivered brought light to my world once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment I receive the newspaper from you, I feel courageous, energetic."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, I want to thank you, over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you, Riku-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you for delivering the warm newspaper. Really, thank you very much."</p>

<p class="null-h1">Chapter 3</p>
<p class="null-h2">The Color of The Vast, Vast Sky</p>
<p class="null-p">Three days had passed since Chise's mother phone call.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since then, neither parent contacted each other and Chise could not find out anything more about their porce settlement.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was noon. Dinnertime.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise looked, no, glared down at the dandelion-colored plate in front of her with a frown.</p>
<p class="null-p">The edge of the plate was indented and it really resembled a dandelion. It was so cute it could make you smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as those thinly-sliced green objects were not present on its surface.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or, at the very least, if the glossy-looking green objects were not vegetables known as green peppers.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, even if they were to bear that name, Chise would be fine with them if they did not taste like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chise-san, you don't have to force yourself," said Andou-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I will eat them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise answered with determination on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about I cook them a little? Some bonito flakes should be able to reduce the bitterness and make them delicious. Or maybe, I can add some tomatoes and bacon, and fry everything in olive oil. Or add some minced meat to make patties so that you can't feel the texture… You don't have to force yourself to eat something you don't like."</p>
<p class="null-p">Three days ago, Chise had told Andou-san that she hoped for green peppers to be added to the side dishes. Andou-san was yet to understand why had she done so.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the first day, Chise managed to successfully down the broiled green peppers and, on the second day, she cleared the stuffed green peppers. The third day brought eggplant, green peppers, and shimeji mushrooms with Japanese-styled pasta. On the fourth day, this day, Chise wanted to challenge raw green peppers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I cannot taste green peppers in the meal, I cannot say I have conquered them, no?"</p>
<p class="null-p">So Chise picked up her chopsticks, picked up a slice with just a tiny touch of Italian salad dressing, and brought it to her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">It tasted bitter after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">So bitter it made her groan, but she chewed and swallowed it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Followed by another slice.</p>
<p class="null-p">And another slice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chise-san, you don't look so good."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-sorry... I'll just try to smile."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise fixed a smile on her face, picked up another bit of green pepper, and brought it to her mouth, still smiling as she chewed them.</p>
<p class="null-p">After swallowing, she smiled again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...You don't have to have to force a smile as you eat them either," muttered Andou-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared this approach also would not work.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This is really difficult.)</p>
<p class="null-p">But if she could force herself to like the taste of green peppers, she might be able to gobble them down nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning after she had received the call from her mother, she received the newspapers from Riku. It was because of the encouragement his presence offered that she recovered. Ever since that morning, she had made up her mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to become stronger.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though her parents were going to porce, she wanted to be able to smile with determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to become independent. She wanted to be like Riku-kun, capable of delivering newspapers to supplement the family income.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise asked Andou-san to allow her to not only clear the cutlery but also to do housework.</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san initially refused. "I can't allow you to do this, Young Miss," she said. "You may leave the cutlery to me." However, ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Back in Tokyo, my parents would not allow me to do housework. And I do want to learn some essential life skills."</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ Chise kept pleading with sincerity.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really. You must finish your school assignments first, though." Eventually, Andou-san reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Chise's goals also included conquering the foods she hated.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I am going to learn how to eat green peppers this summer!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise again glared at the plate covered with green peppers.</p>
<p class="null-p">The dandelion-colored plate was filled with the horrible things, giving the appearance of a sumptuous meal. Chise couldn't help but marvel at the sight as she chewed on the green peppers one by one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, the last green pepper was swallowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for the meal." This time, her smile was genuine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san looked impressed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, there were three full green peppers on that plate," she said. "You managed to finish them all."</p>
<p class="null-p">The rest of the menu consisted of chicken gomoku rice, yuzu and mizuna lettuce, and shiitake soup. Each of them was delicious too. Chise also helped to cut the daikon and ginseng.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be fair, she had cooked a few dishes with her classmates during the culinary classes in the past. However, she had only ever been in charge of a few menial tasks back then, like peeling yam, sieving flour, cleaning the used utensils, and so on. Thus, it was a refreshing, interesting experience to have an experienced helper like Andou-san guide her in how to cut vegetables and season a meal.</p>
<p class="null-p">If her parents were going to porce, her entire life would change completely, and there might not be any happy things awaiting her thereafter. But ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">(After Riku-kun delivered newspapers to me, I became really enthusiastic. Andou-san taught me lots about of housework too.)</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ her heart remained filled with thanks to Riku, and a bunch of hopelessly sweet thoughts.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the following morning, she waited for Riku at the gate as usual and, when a thin ray of light appeared at the crest of the hill, the boy arrived on his bicycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go-good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise approached the postbox and lowered her head as she greeted Riku. The boy did likewise in a shy response.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The weather is fine today too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the day when Riku had been late delivering the newspapers, both parties started talking a little more.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's demeanor remained standoffish, and even though he did talk, he uttered only a few words. Chise, in turn, was overly tense, stammering for a few moments before going silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">But one could truly sense a certain change between those two since that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise might not be the only one who realized this. Riku might have as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">His words were often terse and cold, but he did respond to Chise. There were times when he appeared to want to speak to the girl, staring at her face only to hurriedly avert his eyes when handing over the newspapers. Or looking back while getting into the saddle when he was about to cycle off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last time, when Chise's and Riku's eyes had met, the girl's heart threatened to jump out of her chest. Riku too raised his eyebrows in shock and immediately turned his face away.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun just looked at me!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's mind went blank, her sizzling cheeks were so hot they threatened to self-ignite.</p>
<p class="null-p">She went back indoors with her cheeks red, her heart beating wildly. After hurriedly climbing the stairs, she laid out the newspapers on the floor. The contents somehow seemed to be a lot sweeter than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to say many more things to Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to know Riku a little better.</p>
<p class="null-p">These desires kept intensifying, but Riku had to deliver his newspapers within a certain time, and Chise could not keep delay him for too long.</p>
<p class="null-p">On this day, having received the newspapers as usual, as she was about to thank him, Riku spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I read... that novel," he muttered, as always avoiding looking at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">This startled Chise quite a bit and she looked at him again</p>
<p class="null-p">"...The one serialized in the newspaper," he added, maintaining his gloomy look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did Riku grow curious about the novel because Chise had mentioned she was looking forward to the continuation?</p>
<p class="null-p">(Waaah...! What do I do now?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face immediately flared bright red. Riku had remembered what she had said, had developed an interest in that novel, and was willing to tell her about it to boot. She was really happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The story is great, isn't it?" she whispered with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">Having said that, Riku muttered a goodbye and pedaled off faster than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">The frail figure slowly faded in the distance, taking with it the sound of tires grinding against the dirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise suddenly recalled that she was yet to thank Riku on this day so, holding the newspapers down to her chest, she yelled, "thank you for delivering the newspapers!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not know if her voice reached him because he didn't look back.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I will be waiting for you tomorrow too.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise embraced the newspapers once again and, with a sweet smile and heart full of bliss, she returned indoors.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her feather-light feet carried her up the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened the door, knelt upon the thin carpet, and laid out the still warm newspapers and the colorful advertisements.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, next to them, she placed a scrapbook, glue, pair of scissors, and colored pens.</p>
<p class="null-p">It made the floor look like it was blooming with flowers, and just by looking at this Chise felt her heart was bursting with excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">She started reading. The horizons of her world expanded, and she started imagining various things.</p>
<p class="null-p">She soaked the new experiences with her eyes, her ears, and her skin, encountering the unknown, hearing the unknown, and obtaining new knowledge.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, Chise saw depressing, terrifying incidents amongst the articles.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she also saw delightful reports, heartwarming anecdotes, or some surprising information.</p>
<p class="null-p">The counselor's answer in the life advice column was crisp and clear; the 4koma left her chuckling; even the quarreling couple in the serialized novel finally conveyed their feelings to each other, the heartwarming development soothing her soul.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is great that Saburo-san and Wakako-san are finally able to get along."</p>
<p class="null-p">She heaved a sigh of relief, but also suddenly recalled the conversation she had with Riku earlier in the morning, and her cheeks immediately sizzled.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun is reading the same story...)</p>
<p class="null-p">What were Riku's thoughts after reading today's chapter? It would have been great if she continued the conversation tomorrow, but could she? Would he think of her as a strange girl?</p>
<p class="null-p">(I really want to talk to Riku-kun a little more…but…I guess that is impossible…since he is different from me. He is a middle schooler that is already helping his mother through work, delivering newspapers...)</p>
<p class="null-p">She found this Riku to be really admirable.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at the same time, she was very envious of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun's mother really depends on him...)</p>
<p class="null-p">There were times when Chise would imagine Riku's daily life with his mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">Theirs was not a big family, surely it was peaceful and filled with warmth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How nice," she muttered to herself with envy.</p>
<p class="null-p">(If Riku-kun's family is like this...)</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be great if Riku-kun was living a happy life...</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku really did not want to see his mother, so after delivering the newspapers, he went straight to school and stayed in the Arts Club room alone, drawing.</p>
<p class="null-p">He applied the warm colors of sunset to the canvas and, at the same time, he recalled the adorable memory of the thin, fluttering white ribbon, and the clean looking, long, black hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The apprehensive girl with white, delicate skin, and a petite body…</p>
<p class="null-p">On the night of Riku's crying mother return after she had been dumped by her latest boyfriend, the woman kept clinging to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Just smile...smile. Riku, why aren't you smiling?</p>
<p class="null-p">His mother kept shaking him, reproaching him. Every corner of his world was hollow and filled with darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was he destined to spend his entire life in such darkness?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was he destined to trudge on with this hollow, parched heart?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was this really 'living'?</p>
<p class="null-p">Was there a reason to keep living on this planet?</p>
<p class="null-p">It was almost midnight when his mother finally calmed down. She slept like a child, her arms latched around his neck. He couldn't be bothered to pry them off and leaned onto the wall until it was dawn.</p>
<p class="null-p">The newspapers delivery was due soon after, so he had no intention to fall asleep but unwittingly did so nonetheless when dawn approached.</p>
<p class="null-p">He woke up and found that it was 30 minutes past the usual time he left home.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was late!</p>
<p class="null-p">He hurriedly laid his mother onto the floor, put a blanket over her, washed his face, and dashed out of his apartment.</p>
<p class="null-p">He forgot to leave a key at home.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not that she would use it even if he did. Whenever she was at home, in- or outdoors, the front door was always opened. But no thief would steal from such a tattered apartment even if it was empty. And even if one tried, there was nothing to steal.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku rode upon the bicycle, huffing and puffing, towards the newsagent.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riku, you're late!" growled the owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry," he apologized as he rushed to stuff the sheets of marketing material into the freshly printed newspapers, before placing everything into the back seat and the basket of the bike.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Careful out there! If anything happens to you, the shop will be in trouble!" Riku heard the boss growl before stepping on the pedals hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku had never been late before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because he was a middle schooler, no other place in this rural village was willing to give him work. Thus, not to lose this one, he was often tense and cautious to avoid mistakes.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, he bought two alarm clocks from the 100-yen shop, but they never got to ring.</p>
<p class="null-p">He always woke up before the alarm time, prepared himself, and went to the shop. He would then collect the newspapers and deliver them to every household that placed an order.</p>
<p class="null-p">This had always been the case for at least two years now.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Riku was late this time. Peevish, he remembered that his mother would remain at home until she fell in love again and he felt frustration.</p>
<p class="null-p">If his mother really wanted to know why he did not smile...</p>
<p class="null-p">Just imagining his crying mother embracing him, asking him to smile, left him increasingly frustrated, as if someone was clawing away at his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">He inadvertently hated his mother's immaturity and insensitivity.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what he thought of his only kin. Surely, he had not been quite right in his head. Perhaps he was unable to communicate with anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku never thought of getting involved with anyone. He was at his most relaxed when he was drawing alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">But his world was like a newspaper page, rough, dry, and filled with dull grey. No matter how he moved forth, he could not see the end and felt no urge to carry on.</p>
<p class="null-p">The emptiness, mixed with rage, filled Riku's heart, and all he could make himself do was to keep delivering the papers like a robot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aren't you later than usual today?" grumbled the early riser old man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku could only lower his head and murmur an apology. After dealing with half of the route in his manner, he finally arrived at the girl's house.</p>
<p class="null-p">The old, majestic-looking villa surrounded by a fence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Where the girl stood apprehensively at the fence every morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">On this day too, she stood next to the postbox, her head lowered uneasily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she was disappointed that the newspapers had not been delivered.</p>
<p class="null-p">How long did she stand there, staring at the empty postbox?</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt his heart be gripped by something and, at that moment, the girl suddenly lifted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once she saw Riku approaching on the bicycle, her adorable black eyes grew wide like saucers.</p>
<p class="null-p">She seemed taken aback. Perhaps she had assumed Riku would not come.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tender lips widened slightly, her eyes wide open as she stared at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, he had kept her waiting for a long time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, Riku lamented the fact that he was late. He took out the newspaper from the basket and handed it over to the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">And this time, her face seemed full of shock, just as when she had received the newspapers from him for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">She kept staring at Riku, who inadvertently held his breath as he studied her little white face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The slender arms slowly reached out, and the pure, speckles hands received the newspapers from Riku's with a little shiver.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment, Riku noticed the girl's eyes were a little red and he was quietly startled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also at this moment, the girl's cheeks and lips seemed to ignite fiery red and a clear glint shone in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She smiled a blissful smile, one akin to a blooming mountain flower of purity unknown to man. When it bloomed before him, his heart throbbed, and he kept staring at her startled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku did not know why would she smile so happily.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/riku-and-chise_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Was it because she had been waiting for him to deliver the newspapers? Was it because he finally arrived?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just because of that?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Like usual, the girl thanked him bashfully. However, Riku could sense from the tone of her voice that she was filled with boundless joy and gratefulness. All because of some newspapers!</p>
<p class="null-p">Just because of this, her eyes dazzled, her cheeks reddened, and she brought the crude, grey pile of papers Riku delivered close to her chest like a treasure...</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment, a ray of warm light shone into Riku's hollow heart, and the dull, colorless world brightened immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that girl's smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">For she really treasured the newspaper so much and was hugging it firmly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's world seemed to come under a spell. All he saw, the meaning to everything changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything was being purified by the girl, becoming crystal clear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku wanted to remain at this place, to keep looking at her blissful face, and yet, at the same time, he had the urge to flee from her immediately. Those conflicting feelings left him rattled, and thus, he lowered his head, and gingerly pedaled off towards the next customer.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since that day, the girl at the villa seemed to be a special existence to Riku's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not understand in what sense she was special.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, Riku had never paid particular attention to others, let alone girls. However, this girl was different from his classmates, and he found her to be important.</p>
<p class="null-p">He started to worry about how the girl would view him, and really did not wish to offend her with his crude words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever he delivered newspapers to the villa, his heart would speed up a notch. As soon as he saw the red postbox, his heart would skip a beat. When he would see the girl standing apprehensively by the postbox, his chest would fill with warmth and his breath would be taken from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to talk with her a little more. He wanted to hear just a little bit more of her voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">These thoughts were a lot more intense compared to before, almost spilling out of his mouth. He was flustered by this, and at the same time, he tried to chat with the girl many a time, only to fail every attempt. However one day, they finally managed to have a decent conversation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I read... that novel."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl exclaimed in shock, probably due to how unexpected his sudden words were.</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, Riku was remorseful and anxious, but he muttered once again, "...the one serialized in the newspaper."</p>
<p class="null-p">It took effort to eke out those words. This time, the girl looked perturbed and seemed to hesitate.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The story is great, isn't it?" she asked with a tender smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's kind understanding caused his heart to sizzle and race. He found himself embarrassed. Then, with a forlorn heart that felt like it had been doused in cold water, he flatly muttered, "…Yeah," and quickly pedaled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt happy to be able to talk to the girl, but why did he feel so forlorn?</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, it was because, even though he had read the novel the girl liked, he was unable to have the same feelings as her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The story depicted a large family living on the old streets after the War. Theirs was a bustling, heartwarming daily life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each character was earnest, understanding. They would laugh and cry as they continued with their busy lives...</p>
<p class="null-p">Such an ordinary, peaceful story as witnessed by his cold eyes seemed to be a fantasy of a distant world.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if this story could bring a gentle smile to the girl's lips and cause her to say that 'it was great', surely, it resonated with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, the girl had a 'family' she could rely on, one like in the story.</p>
<p class="null-p">(That girl... She's different from me. She's a Princess, a rich person living in the city. People dote her.)</p>
<p class="null-p">This fact cooled his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at the same time, the girl really saved him. Her upbringing in an affectionate family allowed her to become a girl who could share this warmth with others. These thoughts made his heart tighten.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was startled, and the thin contact lens slipped off her finger, falling into the drainage hole.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was night.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise removed her contact lens in the washroom and pinched it with her thumb and index finger as she washed it with tap water, only for the tragedy to strike. "Uu..."</p>
<p class="null-p">She frowned dejectedly as she looked down at the bottom of the sink.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had first started wearing contact lenses in the spring of her second year of Middle school.</p>
<p class="null-p">Initially, she had been wearing the hard lenses, rather than the soft disposable ones, to correct her astigmatism. She had to put them on in the morning, and remove them at night. Back then, she would plug the drainage hole with a special stopper, and then carefully wash them. It was only when she had gotten used to the habit that she would not necessarily use the plug all the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once, she had accidentally washed her contact lens away.</p>
<p class="null-p">That had caused her to be a little cautious for a period of time, but it appeared she had just let her guard down again.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how she peered into the drainage hole, the washed away contact lens could not be seen.</p>
<p class="null-p">So she put on her glasses and sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made a mistake again..."</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared that since she made the same mistake again, she was far from being the ideal independent female. One might however also say that these things just happen, and even an independent female may lose or break her contact lenses once every while.</p>
<p class="null-p">She let her thoughts run wild with no rhyme or reason until, suddenly, in her shock, she realized something.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What do I do tomorrow morning!?)</p>
<p class="null-p">It was night. There was no way she could obtain new contact lenses before daybreak.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she took a bus to the town, she would probably be able to find an optician capable of producing contact lenses she required, but the earliest that could happen was tomorrow during business hours.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's natural vision in both eyes was no better than 0.04. Without her contact lenses, she could not read words located beyond 30cm away.</p>
<p class="null-p">But she found it embarrassing to meet Riku while wearing glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">There had been that one time that she had been wearing glasses when she had looked out of the second-floor bedroom. Their eyes had met before she had hurriedly pulled the curtains down. He had probably never seen her clearly in that short moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this time, Riku would clearly see her wearing glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">It required her lots of courage to show him an appearance that differed from her usual self.</p>
<p class="null-p">(And I am...unsuited to wearing glasses... Also, mine have a black frame. It does not look cute at all...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise suddenly felt strong regret. If she had known this would happen, she would have made a cuter pair of spectacles instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put on her black-framed glasses, stood before the washroom mirror, and stared back at herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Reflected on the surface of the mirror was a plain, dull girl with no charm. She resembled a disciplinary committee chairperson. or a bookworm of the kind that only appeared in gag manga.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I look ugly!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise immediately frowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">She covered her glasses with both hands and knelt in front of the basin with a groan.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uu, I should not be showing this ugly look to Riku-kun!"</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning, after much thinking, Chise decided at the last moment to go out with only the right contact lens on.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she could see with one eye, things might somehow work out.</p>
<p class="null-p">The plan of having one good eye and one blurry eye, however, fell to pieces the moment she stepped outside. She instantly felt groggy and stumbled about.</p>
<p class="null-p">Within a few seconds, she felt discomfort and sat down just inside the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I-I will stay here for a moment...)</p>
<p class="null-p">If she closed her eyes, she could maybe hang on.</p>
<p class="null-p">She just had to head out when Riku was about to arrive, approach the postbox, and wait to collect the delivery.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be but a moment and she should be able to endure this little bit of discomfort.</p>
<p class="null-p">But gathering her wits took longer than expected. By the time she opened the front door, Riku had already arrived by the postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Uh oh!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise ran out in a hurry.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment, her field of vision shook violently, and her body tumbled forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise wanted to run forward, but her feet were stumbling about, not willing to obey her instructions. A thought occurred to her that walking slowly with her eyes closed might be safer, but she wanted to arrive by the postbox just now. At this moment ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">- a pair of thin arms supported her stumbling body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku caught Chise.</p>
<p class="null-p">He saw that she was stumbling, and left the bicycle to approach her, perhaps irate by her tardiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise crashed into his hard chest, catching a whiff of the scent of his sweat. Her thoughts were utter chaos.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ri-Riku-kun is carrying me...! Riku-kun's arms are on my shoulders‐‐Riku-kun's smell‐‐his chest ‐‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">While Riku did look gaunt, he was strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">He held up Chise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...You don't have to come out if you aren't feeling well."</p>
<p class="null-p">The deep voice muttered flatly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it is n-not that. I am feeling fine, but..."</p>
<p class="null-p">If Chise was to say that she was only wearing one contact lens, she would have to explain everything that had happened since yesterday night.</p>
<p class="null-p">And that she could not do, for the reason was that she did not want to show Riku her ugly self while wearing the black-framed glasses. That was why she had been stumbling about.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could never, ever say that aloud.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she did, Riku might look down on her, thinking her a girl full of fake humility.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just imagining it caused her cheeks to sizzle immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your face is red. Having a cold?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was so tense, she was breathless. To Riku, she appeared to be in discomfort. Thus, he carried her to the hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">He then returned to the bicycle and handed the newspapers over to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-thank you..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise held her newspapers, her head lowered bashfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...No problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku muttered. He wanted to say something but did not. He ran back to the bicycle and pedaled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I caused Riku-kun so much trouble...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise returned to the washroom dejectedly, removed the lens from her right eye, washed it, and returned it to the case. Then, she put on her glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her vision became clear. The mirror showed a devastated girl wearing blackframed glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her shoulders lowered, she returned to her room on the second floor and opened the newspapers. There was a promotional pamphlet from an optician stuck between the pages, one that appeared to sell contact lenses too. Thus, after she finished her breakfast, she took the bus to town.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was morning, and the bus was full of people. She managed to find a seat, however.</p>
<p class="null-p">The vehicle rumbled on, past the plains and fields, down the quiet countryside road. Half an hour later, a tall building finally appeared outside the window.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bus stopped before a department store, with a banner that read 'Summer Special Sales' on the door. Almost all the passengers alighted here.</p>
<p class="null-p">The glasses shop from the pamphlet was on the town's main road and Chise found it immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">She did a vision check and ordered the same brand of contact lenses as the one that had washed away.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the clerk reported that they had just sold out on this brand and there would be at least two days wait.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Would you try a different brand?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise really wanted to obtain new contact lenses. After much thought, however, she decided to stick with the brand she was familiar with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I can come back to collect in two days."</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise wore her black-framed glasses and stood in the courtyard, waiting apprehensively for Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had been wearing a single contact lens the previous day, causing Riku trouble. Thus, she made up her mind to wear glasses this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was dressed in the white dress she liked, but she was worried that it did not match the black frames causing her appearance to look off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though worried, she left earlier than usual so that she would not miss out on Riku's delivery time. Riku, on his bicycle, as usual, approached the residence slowly as she lazed around behind the fence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, her heart pounded loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her slightly reddened face frowned as she stood by the postbox, full of expectations.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Riku saw Chise's face, his eyes went wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's face started to feel hotter and hotter by the second, and sweat started to trickle from her armpits.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stared at her face more intently than usual, and it left her flustered. Perhaps the glasses looked weird after all?</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had a sudden urge to explain to Riku that she would only be wearing glasses these two days, that she would be wearing contact lenses again after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once he noticed her blushing face, Riku realized he was staring too intently, and awkwardly averted his eyes, handing the newspapers over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise received the newspapers with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No worries."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku muttered and lowered his head respectfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he looked towards Chise's eyes again, averted his eyes again, and hurried off.</p>
<p class="null-p">On this day, they did not talk to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise lowered her shoulders dejectedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She spent that morning finishing her remaining assignments, and during afternoon tea time, she pinched the muscats chilling in the freezer.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put the icy-hard green muscats onto her palm and, at that moment, she immediately felt a cold sensation spread out from the point of contact. She rolled them gently and peeled them.</p>
<p class="null-p">The crystal-like, transparent fruit had a refreshing taste of sorbet which, combined with the soft fruity flesh, formed a unique flavor. The frozen fruit left behind a stinging cold sensation that slowly melted away in the mouth, leaving Chise elated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This really is a unique way of eating it," said Andou-san to Chise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The newspaper recommended it. It was written that various frozen things can taste unexpectedly delicious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So it was you who put the baumkuchen, red bean bun, butter buns, honeydew buns, fruit Swiss rolls, chocolate croissants, and cotton candy into the freezer, Chise-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's cheeks reddened as she whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">The muscat was to Chise's liking, and she wanted to try other foods, so she wrapped everything she could get her hands on in cling wrap, and put it in the freezer.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would probably take quite a while before she finished it all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Feels just like an elementary schooler's summer experiment," said the housekeeper with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise once again blushed, tucking her head in as she pretended to adjust her glasses.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The next morning, Chise appeared with her glasses on, and Riku kept staring at her all the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">He could have asked why she was wearing them, but he didn't and kept himself to simply studying that part of her face. It was all the more embarrassing for Chise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps even more embarrassing than wearing a swimsuit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-erm, it seems…there will be rain, this afternoon," she said in a shrill voice deliberately avoiding the subject.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I have been talking about the weather recently.)</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she did not know what to talk about, especially at this critical juncture.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's response was a terse, "yeah." He then handed over the newspapers and left, but not before one last long look at her face and glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Th-thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise deliberately lowered her head so that Riku could look at her face no longer. However, her bow was too deep and the glasses slid down her nose. She barely managed to hold them back in place with one hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">Later that afternoon Chise took the bus to the city once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I can wear contact lenses again tomorrow.)</p>
<p class="null-p">She held her hand to her chest with relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning was clear and sunny, but before she knew it, the skies were filled with dark clouds. Perhaps the weather report was accurate and there might even be a thunderstorm.</p>
<p class="null-p">(It will be good if I can return in time...)</p>
<p class="null-p">But the optician was busier than she expected, and collecting the order took her some time. She managed to procure two sets of contact lenses, had the shop attendant help her, and boarded the bus with a smile preparing to head back.</p>
<p class="null-p">But once the bus started to move, its windows started to be pelted by raindrops.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ah, it is starting to rain...)</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just a drizzle at first but, slowly, the downpour hitting the windows grew stronger and stronger. Just as Chise was starting to worry that the rain might break the glass, there was a bright flash.</p>
<p class="null-p">She gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Lightning!?)</p>
<p class="null-p">The next moment, a sharp, deafening noise roared through the skies on the way to her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I-I hate this.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was scared of thunder.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Chise found flashing lights in the sky pretty, she hated the loud boom that followed immediately after. She hated all kinds of loud sounds, like the noise of human commotion, animal growls, or the crash of falling and breaking objects. But amongst all of that, Chise hated the powerful boom of thunder the most.</p>
<p class="null-p">She shriveled on the cushioned seat, covering her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, the thunderclaps kept coming, the earth-shattering noise reaching her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was already terrified to hear thunder at home. Having to hear it inside the bus had her heart beating wildly. She imagined the dazzling lightning accompanying the tremendous noise, striking the roof of the bus. That image made her shiver all over.</p>
<p class="null-p">She heard that electricity was drawn to metal and the bus so happened to be metallic.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Please do not land here.)</p>
<p class="null-p">She prayed quietly in her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt like she was riding a roller coaster in a theme park. Whenever the alluring lights flickered in the skies outside, she would instinctively jolt, and the boom that followed would cause her heart to race faster. The rain kept getting increasingly stronger, pelting the windows without mercy.</p>
<p class="null-p">How many stops had it been?</p>
<p class="null-p">The rain and thunder did not relent.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared as though the lightning was pursuing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Another four stops and Chise would get off the bus.</p>
<p class="null-p">She brought a folded umbrella along, but if she was to alight from the bus at this point, she had no confidence in her ability to return home in this weather.</p>
<p class="null-p">If this kept up, she might not be able to do so. This troubled her.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Please stop, rain.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise covered her ears and looked out of the window timidly. At this moment, she noticed a boy riding a bicycle alongside the bus.</p>
<p class="null-p">(No way!)</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy was dressed in a white shirt and black pants. It appeared to be a school uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">(It really is Riku-kun...!)</p>
<p class="null-p">The bus slowed down to stop at a red light.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku kept pedaling next to the vehicle and he charged across the junction at the last moment before the lights changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">His hair and shirt were drenched by the rain and stuck closely to his thin body making him look frailer than usual and yet, somehow, stronger. He charged forth with narrowed eyes and a scowl on his face, as though challenging the storm itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The red light turned green and the bus started moving again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's hands, which were covering her ears just a moment ago, were now firmly pressing against the glass while as she sought for Riku's silhouette in the gloom.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once she saw that familiar silhouette, her heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he passed her by, she saw the rain-soaked sidelong face. He looked grim, extremely manly. Her heart felt concern because Riku kept charging forth in the midst of the thunderstorm without even an umbrella. That amazed and excited her.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she were to open the window and call for Riku, could he hear her voice?</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Chise had forgotten that she hated the sound of thunder.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart was driven by one impulse. She wanted to run to Riku's side, even if she got drenched in rain, even if the lightning struck her. However, the bus just overtook him again and left him behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun...)</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment, she felt like a thousand blades stabbed her heart at once.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I hope that Riku-kun can return home safely and that the rain will stop sooner. I hope the lightning will not strike him. I hope his bicycle will not crash because of the slippery road.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise stared at the wet window and kept praying with bated breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time Chise reached her stop, the lightning was starting to fade away, and the rain had weakened greatly.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Has Riku-kun...returned home?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise thought of Riku cycling in the rain with a scowl on his face, of his delicate and feisty silhouette, and her heart ached tremendously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely this pain was a result of her own weakness. Riku was strong, able to get through this thunderstorm on his own. She, on the other hand, was a lot weaker and unable to stand on equal footing with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The dirt path leading home had not been paved with asphalt, so all the rainwater had turned it into soft, mushy mud that stained her sandals and the hem of her skirt. By the time she reached the villa, she looked tragic.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">(I want to draw that girl.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku gritted his teeth and pedaled on through the thunderstorm, thinking about the girl at the villa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Earlier today, Riku drew a sketch of that girl while in the school's art clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Using a pencil, he drew her silhouette on the canvas, the thin and long black hair, white skin, and petite body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Typically, he would not draw people.</p>
<p class="null-p">His classmate Suzuka had often leaned over in this direction, saying, "Use me as a model then!" only to be ignored her coldly. She would always growl that he was petty in response, or say, "Besides, you probably don't want to show it because your drawing is too terrible!".</p>
<p class="null-p">But no matter how she would try to taunt him, he did not want to draw her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither Suzuka nor any other girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">But lately, whenever he was at home or the club room, instead of wanting to draw scenes from around the village, as usual, his mind conjured one image on the canvas or the back of the adverts. Image of that apprehensive, bashful girl standing on the cold morning air next to the red postbox, her long hair dancing slightly with the wind.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to draw, those fine threads of hair, the petite lips, the large, watery eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">That desire took a hold of his heart more than once.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when she had come out to meet him while wearing her glasses, the desire to draw her discreetly took firm root.</p>
<p class="null-p">The glasses were large, black-framed, and loomed over her bashful reddening face. That sight shook Riku greatly for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">She just seemed so different from usual...</p>
<p class="null-p">These uncanny differences caused his heart to throb. He stared at the girl intently, to the point of rudeness even, and she eventually lowered her eyes in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression was more mature than usual, cuter. Riku wanted to draw this face, the impulse to do this held sway over his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">So, once he was done delivering the newspapers, he changed into his uniform at the newspaper shop, went straight to school, laid the sketchbook on the rack, and focused on his image of the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face was probably like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her lips, her eyebrows... like this probably.</p>
<p class="null-p">The eyes deep beneath the glasses had a round look to them. Apprehensive, reserved.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's appearance from earlier the morning lurked in Riku's mind like a ghost, her fleeting presence leaving him anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once he was done, however, he gritted his teeth. The girl on the canvas was a lot less charming than the one his eyes had witnessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This isn't how she looks!)</p>
<p class="null-p">The eyes should be purer. The lip smaller, softer...</p>
<p class="null-p">(It's completely different!)</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Riku, unable to produce a sketch that satisfied him, tore up all the attempts he had made that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the next morning, the girl from the villa wore glasses again as she stood by the postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Right, this should be the look.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's heart beat wildly again.</p>
<p class="null-p">(The actual person looks best. Better remember this face well. Especially the balance of those glasses. Better make sure I get a good look.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku narrowed his eyes at the girl, but his gaze was probably a little too intense because the girl reacted as if he had been glaring at her. She said in a shrill voice, "there might be rain in the afternoon."</p>
<p class="null-p">But Riku never heard her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He hastily handed off the newspaper and pedaled away hard. This morning he was focused on making his round as soon as possible so that he would be able to finish the drawing of the girl on this day.</p>
<p class="null-p">But in the end, he ended up tearing the pages of his sketchbook again.</p>
<p class="null-p">To make things worse, on the way back home from school, there was a sudden downpour, accompanied by thunder. The terrible weather seemed to reflect his mood. He frowned as he glared at the rain, pedaling hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lightning flashed several times accompanied by loud booms. Each thunderclap inflaming his frustration and anxiety.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I worked so hard to look at her, so why can't I draw her well!?)</p>
<p class="null-p">He roared from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl in his mind was adorable, charming. The moment he would try converting that image into a drawing, the result was so ordinary, bereft of all the colors it should have.</p>
<p class="null-p">Angst gnawed at his mind and he wanted to scream out loud.</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew it was dangerous cycling too quickly in the rain, but he forced his way past a bus and jumped the traffic lights at the junction seconds before they turned red.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was unable to draw the beauty formed in his heart, and the rage this caused gradually became a desire that burned hot within him. He wanted to draw her well no matter what.</p>
<p class="null-p">(How do I draw her?)</p>
<p class="null-p">If the girl was standing before him, perhaps then he could capture her charm perfectly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Should he ask her to be a model?</p>
<p class="null-p">(That's impossible.)</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way he could ask the Princess of the Villa to do this. The village was small, and everyone would know immediately. He must not cause trouble for the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, she was shy and introverted. There was no way he could convince her to accept his request.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, the skies were cloudless, endless, and blue.</p>
<p class="null-p">The ground remained a little wet though, and there were was an occasional droplet of water visible here and there on the grass and the vines.</p>
<p class="null-p">On her way back home yesterday, Chise bought blue rain boots with white water droplets pattern from the village's convenience store. She went out to wait for Riku wearing these boots, muscat green T-shirt, and a cyan flared skirt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hair was tied into twin tails that she had draped along the chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today, even if it rained, there was no need to worry about rain or mud getting onto her shoes or dress. Of course, she was wearing contact lenses</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku finally appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">His face looked as aloof as usual, but he appeared otherwise unscathed and did not seem to have caught a cold from getting drenched. Chise heaved a happy sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">And her cheeks naturally raised to form a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">But once Riku saw her, he was taken aback and his face immediately stiffened.</p>
<p class="null-p">His eyes grew wide and he was staring at her intently.</p>
<p class="null-p">At her face and eyes to be precise, and for quite a while too.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed he was struggling with something, wondering why was Chise not wearing glasses perhaps? Should she explain? Wouldn't it be a little too late?</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku was so mesmerized by Chise's face that he even forgot to take out the newspapers</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was inadvertently terrified.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-erm..." she muttered timidly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only then did Riku recover, and he hurriedly took out a newspaper from the basket.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she reached for the newspapers with both hands, she whispered, "Mymy contact lenses fell off, so I had to wear glasses until I got a new pair."</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not ask, and she sounded like she was giving an excuse. It felt really, really embarrassing, so much so that she felt her face go bright red.</p>
<p class="null-p">In reply, Riku looked up at the sky and just said, "Ah, okay."</p>
<p class="null-p">Did this mean that he understood, or that he was just answering for the sake of it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise felt a sudden urge to mention that she saw Riku riding on the bicycle during the thunderstorm. However, she figured she might end up delaying his newspaper delivery, and cause him trouble again if they were to chat longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">She brought the still lukewarm newspapers to her chest,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, she lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed Riku wanted to say something but, before Chise could ask, he acknowledged her with a slight nod as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">But just as he was about to pedal off, he lowered his head slightly, and whispered with a voice only she could hear,</p>
<p class="null-p">"The glasses...do suit you very well."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he averted his eyes again, and in a flash, he was gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise remained rooted to the spot, completely stunned.</p>
<p class="null-p">(...What... did... Riku-kun... just say...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, the cold, deep voice rang in her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Suit you.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Do suit you very well.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Suit, the glasses, he means...? The black framed glasses...! Is he referring the disciplinary-committee-chairman-like glasses?)</p>
<p class="null-p">For a moment, she was confused as to whether she should be happy or sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that usually reticent Riku did speak up to praise her.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I-I guess so. He praised me...)</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not like to wear glasses, but just now the usually aloof Riku noticed Chise's look and said that it suited her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She should be elated.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once all doubt vanished, a sweet feeling arose to take its place, one as sweet as honey. Still wearing the long blue droplet-patterned boots, she jumped-</p>
<p class="null-p">"How delightful."</p>
<p class="null-p">-and the mud splattered everywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">But-</p>
<p class="null-p">"So happy, so happy. Riku-kun..."</p>
<p class="null-p">-Chise just skipped back into the house happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">On this day, she maintained had a smile on her face all the time, no matter whether she was making newspapers clippings, or helping Andou-san with housework.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the afternoon, she helped the housekeeper clear the storeroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">First, they laid out plastic sheets in the courtyard, on which they then stacked old vases, hanging scrolls, and books.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How great that the sun came out and dried the ground," said Andou-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">The items removed from the storage did not appear to be antiques and were not of high value. Everything that had been worth something had been purchased by an antique dealer when the original owner of this house, Shiorisan had died.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your father did say to discard anything unnecessary, Chise-san, but I can't bring myself to do so. Also, there is a need to see if these are really just of no use."</p>
<p class="null-p">The deliberate words of the housekeeper warmed Chise's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a sky-blue bale of cloth in the pile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Chise unfurled it, she found it to be pretty wide. It appeared to be bought with curtain making in mind, and while the color was a little faded, it still retained its unique charm.</p>
<p class="null-p">(It does look like a slice of a summer sky.) Chise was mesmerized by the look of the fabric.</p>
<p class="null-p">"May I have this cloth?" she asked, eyes dazzling.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were instructions on how to sew a dress in the morning's newspaper. The guide was as detailed as a cooking recipe, and Chise felt she was able to do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as Chise explained herself, Andou-san narrowed her eyes and responded,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh, making a dress by yourself! That sounds great. By all means, you can use this cloth however you want. I think I recall a sewing machine lying around somewhere."</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san returned to the storeroom for a brief while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, here it is, Chise-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">The housekeeper was holding a portable sewing machine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was initially worried that the machine would be powered by stepping on the pedal, but while the implement was old, it ran on electricity. Andousan then found an ornate sewing box.</p>
<p class="null-p">The box was large, embroidered with flowers on the outside, and looked heavy. Once the lid was opened, it revealed scissors, needles, rulers, and all the other necessities. There were also zips and buttons, and a large variety of threads.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared she would not need any additional tools or materials.</p>
<p class="null-p">(It will be great if I can finish it this summer vacation.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise imagined the sky-colored fabric becoming a dress, her own self wearing it, and was mesmerized in her own fantasy.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I really want to wear it and show it to Riku-kun.)</p>
<p class="null-p">It was time to do her best!</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise brought the sewing machine, sewing box, and the sky blue fabric to her room on the second floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">But hauling the sewing machine upstairs was a little tough on her</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phew..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sewing box, sky blue fabric, sewing machine. Chise laid out these things in a line, exhaled, and smiled faintly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened the sketchbook and had a look at the dress sewing guide she had just pasted into it this day.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was written there that it is possible to make a dress even without a template.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise laid out the page with the guide, opened the sewing box, and checked the items inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">The box was three-layered. The second layer was crammed with thread reels and buttons which explained the extraordinary weight. The third layer contained a pile of pieces of cloth and felt, but there seemed to be something hidden underneath too.</p>
<p class="null-p">(A book...？)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise removed the material and found not a book, but a diary. It had a handmade cover of sky-blue cloth with a white flower embroidered upon it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise opened it and found the dates and words recorded in blue ink.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Is this, Shiori-san's...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had a look at one of the dates. It appeared to be a diary Shiori-san wrote when she was sixteen.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I do not know if I should read it...)</p>
<p class="null-p">She should not be reading another person's diary. She should really return it to the sewing box.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Shiori-san had died.</p>
<p class="null-p">And Chise was curious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had never met Shiori-san. There had been a funeral service, but it was a private affair and she was not allowed to attend. Ever since she came to this house, she had found herself intrigued by this lady, this Shiori-san, who had lived alone in this cute house. Chise wanted to know what she was like as a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">The villagers called her a fairy. Undoubtedly, she was the prettiest in the village, so why did she not get married?</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she not feel lonely living alone?</p>
<p class="null-p">What kind of life had she lived on her own?</p>
<p class="null-p">When did she write that poem inside the desk drawer? What emotions did she harbor in her soul?</p>
<p class="null-p">If she could understand the young Shiori-san, might she be able to work out the clues and learn what had happened thereafter?</p>
<p class="null-p">After some hesitation, Chise opened the cover of the diary and flipped through the yellow pages.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like Chise, Shiori-san studied at a girls school. From her fine handwriting, it appeared she had a serious personality. She jotted down the minutiae of her school life enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori-san's daily experiences and thoughts were basically no different from Chise's. She would admire flowers with her friends, or discuss the books they liked. There was a passage saying, "this is what XX-chan says, but this is what I do think." Shiori-san would never say what she thought at that time, however, and was devastated for quite a while. There was also an instance of her breaking an egg and being elated when she found two yolks inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise felt similarities with Shiori-san's daily life, and at the same time wondered, (why did Shiori-san leave behind this diary she wrote at the age of sixteen?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise learned from the diary that Shiori-san was a member of the arts and crafts club. In that case, she probably had this sewing box by her side, at a place she could see every day.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet she put her teenage diary inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely it was not a coincidence.</p>
<p class="null-p">This diary Shiori-san had written when she had been years old must have been pretty special to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise kept reading and discovered a reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">During the sixteenth summer of her young life, Shiori-san had fallen in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">A college student came to this village from Tokyo to recuperate due to an unspecified issue. Shiori-san encountered him while he was reading by the forest marsh. After that, they met a few times more, and soon after, fell in love.</p>
<p class="null-p">The words in the diary clearly unveiled the frustrations and excitement he had brought her, so vividly in fact that Chise's cheeks blushed from the lecture and her heart pounded wildly.</p>
<p class="null-p">When it rained, the pair took a stroll sharing an umbrella. Shiori-san was worried that they would be seen, so worried that her heart nearly stopped at times, but she was also really happy, and her face and head were so hot she was feverish, nearly fainting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori-san found a poem collection he was browsing through on that first day in the school library, and as she kept reading, her heart fluttered. She borrowed the book home and recited it alone, her heart racing, bitterness and sweetness filling her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">She did some embroidery on his handkerchief, and when he accepted it, she felt really elated</p>
<p class="null-p">She was on cloud nine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise could understand this feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face would redden, and her heart would jolt whenever she saw him. So elated she was to hear his voice that she nearly ceased to breathe, and the world seemed so dazzling.</p>
<p class="null-p">And at the swamp they first met, Shiori-san made a promise with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">They knew that once he recovered, he would surely return to Tokyo. However, he vowed that he would come back to meet her again.</p>
<p class="null-p">So Shiori answered, "I shall make a new dress, and wait for you. When you return to see me, I shall welcome you in this dress."</p>
<p class="null-p">But the diary did not mention what happened to the two of them thereafter.</p>
<p class="null-p">The diary ended with that entry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori-san never left this village and remained single though. From this, one could tell that he never came back to her…</p>
<p class="null-p">What feelings did she have when she waited for him? When she thought about this, Chise's heart winced.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Did Shiori-san keep believing in him, and wait for him until her death...?) Was that why she did not marry and kept living alone at this house?</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise only learned what she read the diary, and could not answer those questions.</p>
<p class="null-p">All the diary contained was that dazzling love story.</p>
<p class="null-p">What did Shiori-san want to do with this sky blue fabric?</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ I shall make a new dress, and wait for you. When you return to see me, I shall welcome you in this dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise recalled these words, and her heart, brimming with sweetness and sadness, tightened more than ever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori-san's feeling had never been answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the feelings in this diary were so concentrated, so pure, so beautiful, that the whole affair was mesmerizing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori-san had copied the poem she liked so much into the diary.</p>
<p class="null-p">The title was: "Who exactly is he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the title, Chise understood it was the same poem as the one written inside the drawer.</p>
<p class="null-p">The author was a Russian poet who also wrote the folk songs 'Katyusha' and 'Ogonek'. Shiori-san had been taught those by her love.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would recite them often. The more she recited them, the closer she felt to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise too started to recite the verses aloud.</p>
<p class="null-p">"At sunset, a young man,</p>
<p class="null-p">Passed by my door.</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked at me.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without a word.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who exactly is he?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why does he look at me?" "Whenever I left for a stroll,</p>
<p class="null-p">He danced and sang.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever I faded from view beyond the wooden door,</p>
<p class="null-p">He turned aside with a sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">Who exactly is he?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why is he sighing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise opened her lips, sighing. There was some lingering sweetness in her fading breath. The silhouette in her mind somehow changed from Shiorisan's lover to Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who exactly is he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The sun darkened because of him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who exactly is he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A deliverer of mysterious letters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who exactly is he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My heart is about to melt."</p>
<p class="null-p">With every phrase she muttered, her mind conjured an image of that frail boy, his tanned skin, his matured look.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Who exactly is Riku-kun?)</p>
<p class="null-p">When Riku had embraced her with his strong arms when she had stumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Riku, still wearing his uniform, had ridden his bicycle through the thunderstorm with a scowl on his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Riku had paid particular attention to her when she had been wearing her glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise wanted to know Riku more. She did not want to know him as just a newspaper delivery boy, but also about him as a middle schooler. She wanted to know more about those aspects of Riku she knew not of.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 4</p>
<p class="null-h2">The Boy She Knew Not Of</p>
<p class="null-p">The canvas on the stand depicted a serene, slender girl with long hair. Her apprehensive eyes were looking towards Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku added glasses to her face, emphasizing her introverted, pure look.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last Monday, the morning after the rain, he had a conversation with the girl at the villa. Ever since then, he had been focusing wholeheartedly on drawing her image.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before that day, the more he wanted to do her justice, the harder her introverted, serene smile became to grasp, leaving him extremely anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">That morning, Riku went out on his newspaper round with a gloomy look.</p>
<p class="null-p">And like usual, the girl exited the villa grounds apprehensively.</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not wear her glasses this time. Her hair was tied into twin tails, and she was wearing boots with a water droplet pattern.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once she saw Riku, she smiled bashfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her face without the glasses made him a little disappointed. The girl seemed to notice that, her smile froze, and she appeared to be at a loss as to what to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku hurriedly handed the newspaper over. The girl, looking a little nervous, reached out with her hands as usual, but added with blushing cheeks, "Mymy contact lenses fell off, so I had to wear glasses until I got a new pair."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her like this hit Riku hard, just like when he saw her wear glasses for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was clearly not wearing them now.</p>
<p class="null-p">But her whole appearance now was as cute as when she had been wearing the black frames.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her shy look, a little on the immature side, was so pure that Riku's heart fluttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared to him now that he was too focused on the balance between the eyes and the face; all his problems ended up amounting to just a question of a minor touch up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her appearance was simply that of an ordinary girl's.</p>
<p class="null-p">And thus, no matter how Riku tried to capture her likeness, the image on the canvas could be nothing but that of a rather unremarkable, common girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if he could somehow add a little natural, inner charm...</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely he would be able to draw her well now, the girl that made his heart flutter!</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku felt enlightened and just muttered, "ah, okay," in reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">As per usual, the girl cautiously received the newspaper with both hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Also as usual, she lowered her head in gratitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked so apprehensive, so serene.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, Riku felt certain that he would be able to draw her well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was not wearing her glasses, though she was wearing rain boots, and though she looked a different kind of cute with her long hair tied into twin tails draped down her chest. Despite all the changes to her appearance, the pure presence surrounding her remained unaffected.</p>
<p class="null-p">He should request her to be a model after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku felt an irresistible urge to ask the question aloud, but the moment he opened his mouth to speak, he only managed an, "erm…" He stammered for quite a while, and the remaining words withered away stuck in his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Don't get too greedy,) he warned himself silently.</p>
<p class="null-p">He held the bicycle handles firmly, and stepped on the pedals.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The glasses...do suit you well."</p>
<p class="null-p">He hurriedly pedaled off with these words still hanging in the air, not wanting the girl to see his burning face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku never got the girl to be his model and said the most embarrassing line of his life, but he never regretted it.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart was aching, but he was feeling calm. He believed that, as he was now, he would surely be able to draw the girl well.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was alone in the arts clubroom, drawing the girl on his sketch pad to his heart's content.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl wearing the glasses.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl with twin tails.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl wearing the straw hat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl looking up at Riku timidly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl with her eyes wide with shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl holding the newspaper with both hands, looking apprehensive.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl watching him with fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku continued to move the pencil, giving form to the image in his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">The different variations of the girl appeared on the sketchbook as if it was alive.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Not enough...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku could add more charm to her. The image of the girl filled his mind, and he wanted to draw out her presence from within.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were various noises coming from the other end of the gym, including the clashing sounds of the kendo club's bamboo swords, and the bouncing balls of the basketball club. But Riku remained undistracted as he dismissed these noises, and continued to draw.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment, the sliding door of the arts clubroom suddenly opened, and Suzuka appeared at the threshold.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Again you're here. It's like you've moved in here recently. Don't you have any interests other than drawing, Arimura?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka skipped towards Riku, and leaned over to take a peek at the sketchbook.</p>
<p class="null-p">He closed it immediately to the girl's displeasure.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehhh, you're making it seem like what's inside is really improper," she grumbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Anyway, you're probably drawing those boring things again, right? All the grass, trees, fruit... Don't forget I said I'm willing to be your model. Blame yourself for saying no."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku said nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's too late for regrets now, you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's expression remained cold and he himself remained silent. Seeing that, Suzuka pouted and raised her eyebrows high.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmph! Even if you kneel and beg to let you draw me, I'm going to ignore you!" she said in a deliberately loud voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku just hoped she would hurry up and leave. The sooner, the better.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he stayed at home, there would be his mother slobbering around all day, painting her fingernails, calling men on her cellphone.</p>
<p class="null-p">And once he started to draw ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're really gloomy. Do you really want to continue with this boring hobby?"</p>
<p class="null-p">-she would tease him, and start to grumble about the lovers who abandoned her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You mustn't become that kind of man," she would say.</p>
<p class="null-p">That would invariably lead to a longer rant. She would get agitated, say something like, "you're going to abandon me anyway, aren't you!? Why else aren't you smiling when you're with me?" and end up crying her eyes out once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">For that reason, to avoid his mother, Riku had been spending more time in the quiet clubroom. Only to end up encountering Suzuka, the exact same type of person as his mother, who would harass him too. It was really frustrating.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was already glowering at her in silence trying to convey that she was a bother and should leave him alone. For some reason, however, the fouler his mood appeared to be, the closer to him she leaned.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka's appearance and personality were pretty striking, and she was popular with the boys. Perhaps she was miffed that her charms had no effect on Riku, and took his indifference as a challenge?</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way Riku could feel attracted to Suzuka. For a moment, he wondered if he should be frank with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He rejected the idea. If he did so, Suzuka would surely involve the other girls and cause a fuss. This would lead to a long period of frustrations for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">It appeared his only choice was to remain silent until Suzuka left in a huff. So he remained seated on the chair, with his head turned aside unhappily. Suzuka put herself back in front of his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She held a ticket and waved it before his nose. "Arimura, I have a goal for this summer vacation!" She showed an impish smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku did not want to know.</p>
<p class="null-p">But before he could say it, Suzuka's eyes sparkled, and she declared,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm definitely going to make you smile, Arimura!" This time, Riku was truly dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's ridiculous," he muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly, Suzuka showed a hearty smile,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, you're always frowning," she answered. "Arimura. I want to see a smile only I can see!"</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she hastily corrected herself,</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-erm, what I mean by that is, well... Hmph! You realized it already, haven't you!? It's so obvious already. Don't tell me you don't understand? If you say you don't, I'm going to kiss you right here!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She yelled all that out at once with a completely flushed face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The revelation left Riku utterly speechless.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way he did not know. Of course, he did. Suzuka was pursuing him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He maintained this cold demeanor precisely because he did not want Suzuka to misunderstand. And yet she decided to play her hand like this!</p>
<p class="null-p">If Riku remained silent, Suzuka might really kiss him. He could only sigh, and say, "I get it, Ozaki... but I have no intentions of pursuing anything like that right now. I'm already busy just trying to earn money for my living expenses. I don't intend to go out with anyone, you included. I hope you understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka gulped loudly and lowered her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Don't you have the time to draw?" she muttered half to herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she firmly looked straight at him again, raised her dropped shoulders, and shoved the ticket in her hand right in front of Riku's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is a ticket for a band performance at the outdoor stage in town. My friend will be going there and gave me this. Come with me! Arimura, just give me one chance to capture your heart!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka challenged Riku staring straight at him, but soon her eyelids dropped uneasily and tears started to glisten in her eyes. He just looked back at her bitterly.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">It was morning a few days after Chise had begun to work on her new dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku behaved a little strange when he came by to deliver the newspapers today.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was no longer looking at Chise's eyes and, as he handed the newspapers to her, he seemed even more distant than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Did I...do anything rude to Riku-kun?)</p>
<p class="null-p">His back seemed to move even farther away from her eyes, and her heart ached as she watched him leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even when she returned to her room on the second floor and laid out the newspaper on the floor, she was no longer as excited as she used to. All the same, when the smell of ink filled her nostrils, the anxiety in her heart seemed to slowly afflict all her body starting from the fingertips.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Was Shiori-san this lonely and uneasy when she longed for her lover who returned to Tokyo...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise would now reread Shiori-san's diary before she slept. It had become a habit for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mind was always thinking of Shiori-san and her lover. She was unable to rid herself of that fixation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such blissful were the words that narrated the days they spent together.</p>
<p class="null-p">The surging sweet and sour feelings.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sacred promise.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this promise was ultimately unfulfilled. Shiori-san died alone in this</p>
<p class="null-p">house…</p>
<p class="null-p">(No, the ache in my heart grows the more I think about sad things. Must think of some happy things instead.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise put the newspaper aside and prepared the sewing tools.</p>
<p class="null-p">Next, she laid out the incomplete dress, and a piece of blue sky unfurled on the green carpet pouring balm on the restless heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Once the dress is done, I can go out in it. Surely it will be fun. It would be so much better if it was with Riku-kun...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Having a dream never hurt anyone so Chise imagined herself wearing the handmade blue dress, walking alongside the aloof-looking boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Filled with bliss, she began to work on the dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">She started by holding the cloth down with a pin so that she could cut it and sew the pieces together with thread. The little white traces of thread she had chosen streaked across the blue cloth, like cute wisps of rainy clouds.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise kept working the needle, over and over again. Only when Andou-san informed her that the breakfast was ready did she go down to the living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Breakfast consisted of homemade cornbread and yogurt, with summer-orange jam, green peppers, sour-flavored herring, and sweet ketchup on an omelet. Chise finished her breakfast, brought the utensils to the basin, washed everything with the detergent-soaked sponge, and then wiped it all clean with a dry cloth to a high polish.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once done, she scrubbed the basin, mopped the floor, and scrubbed that too. After all the housework was done, Chise felt like her heart was purified as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">She returned to her room and resumed the work on the dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had agreed with Andou-san that they were going to bake a meatloaf pie later. She also planned to finish her assignments today and write letters to her friends and family.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was still a lot of things to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">(It is good to be busy.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise beamed as she tied a loop. She cut off the tip with a pair of round, cute scissors.</p>
<p class="null-p">The meat pie was well done. When the kitchen knife pierced the thin, crispy outer layer, it immediately cracked with a whiff of buttery fragrance. The meat filling within released strong, rich of aroma. The prepared meal had a gentle smell and tasted delicious. Chise munched it together with green pepper salad marinated in yogurt salad sauce.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the afternoon, Chise went to town to buy things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her favorite pastel-green marker pen had run out of ink, so she went to the department store's stationery department to buy a new one and, at the same time, replenish her stocks of postcards, envelopes, and the like.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once she was done, Chise went up to the roof terrace and bought a lemonflavored ice cream soda at the café, with black tea ice cream and a mint leaf as the topping. She ate while resting. At this moment, a group of middle schooler boys holding trays of takoyaki and cola approached, chatting loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Those uniforms...really look the same as the one Riku-kun had on.)</p>
<p class="null-p">The uniforms in question were simply ordinary white shirts and black pants.</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san had mentioned before that there was only one middle school in the area, though. It was therefore likely that Riku too studied there.</p>
<p class="null-p">(...I do have that little urge to look at Riku-kun's school.) This notion arose within her quite suddenly.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I shall go and have a look.)</p>
<p class="null-p">It was summer vacation so there should be few students around. If she just took a peek from the outside...</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be rude to ogle a school one did not attend... but...</p>
<p class="null-p">After a moment of hesitation ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">(Yes, I shall have a look.)</p>
<p class="null-p">- Chise finished her ice cream and soda and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">She took the bus back to the village and alighted at the stop marked XX Middle School, right in front of the school gates.</p>
<p class="null-p">This school looked perfectly ordinary. The baseball club members were training at the sports field, and next to a four-story main compound there was a gym with a swimming pool.</p>
<p class="null-p">But ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">(So this is Riku-kun's school.)</p>
<p class="null-p">- Chise smiled nonetheless, mesmerized by the sight in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">(The track is paved... The gym is big... Ah, so many sakura trees there. There are tennis courts too...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise navigated down the fence and had a good look at the entire school.</p>
<p class="null-p">(So this is where Riku-kun studies...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise recalled him in uniform, and her heart fluttered all the more. The last time she saw him dressed like that, he was soaking wet in the rain. However, she was sure that the simple white shirt and black pants combination suited him well.</p>
<p class="null-p">She made a full circle around the school compound, eventually reaching the gates again to stare blankly at the entrance once more. Suddenly a girl dressed in a plaited miniskirt and a white blouse with the school emblem on passed by Chise from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked pretty. Tall, neatly cut bright-brown short hair, vibrant red lips glossy with moisture.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was probably a student here.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl looked at Chise nonchalantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And since Chise stood in the middle of the school gates ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">- she whispered an apology and hurriedly moved aside.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl sized Chise up, studying her from head to toe. Then, with an unhappy look on her face, she passed Chise by and headed into the school.</p>
<p class="null-p">She might have thought of Chise as someone suspicious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Embarrassed, Chise left the school gates.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since next bus was still a while off, Chise took a stroll back to the villa.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku sat gloomily on the chair in the clubroom, flipping through the sketchbook. The pages were full of the drawings of the girl at the villa.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bashful girl was like a white flower on the yellowish pages, giving off an adorable, yet transparent charm.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt that he had done a good job on those.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku had done his best to bring out the girl's charm. He didn't succeed fully, but he managed to capture a fair bit of her qualities.</p>
<p class="null-p">That didn't seem to have filled the hole in his heart, however.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was delighted that the girl would wait by the postbox every morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing her bashful smile, hearing her whisper, "thank you," all that cleansed and soothed his heart. Every dawn turned into a precious moment to him and he was always looking forward to the next one.</p>
<p class="null-p">But at this point, seeing the pure, innocent face of the girl started to bring him in pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was definitely because Suzuka Ozaki, his classmate, had confessed to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku could not possibly clearly explain to the girl that Suzuka really resembled his mother and the torrential outburst of anxious emotion that accompanied the confession shook him to the core. That it had caused him to realize that, for him, the girl at the villa was such a fleeting, otherworldly existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka was the reality, the girl at the villa was anything but.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe, if they kept having conversations more frequently, the distance between them would shorten. However, as things were, the relationship between the two of them remained nothing more than her receiving newspapers in the morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Neither that girl nor Riku would ever take it any further.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Suzuka had invited Riku to a concert, that girl definitely could not do it. And neither could Riku invite her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not even know the girl's name.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, he had thought this kind of relationship was enough, but before he knew it, he was starting to be unsatisfied. Even though he did understand that it was to be expected...</p>
<p class="null-p">So he turned back on his own expectations towards this girl and let the days just pass by.</p>
<p class="null-p">(If I ask for more... all I am going to feel will be pain...) He should feel fortunate just to be able to draw her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And while he attempted to convince himself with such thoughts ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"Arimura, I brought something to cheer you up!"</p>
<p class="null-p">- Suzuka entered the clubroom with a brazen smile, flashing the plastic bag in her hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I made steamed cocoa bread. Try it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">She pulled the chair next to Riku, sat down, and laid out the bread.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I said I won't be going to the concert, didn't I?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So..."</p>
<p class="null-p">(Just go back already?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku wanted to get straight to the point, but Suzuka stole the initiative as she stared at Riku, grinning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eat it, and you might just change your mind. I haven't gone all out yet and I'm not going to give up that easily"</p>
<p class="null-p">-Arimura, just give me one chance to capture your heart!</p>
<p class="null-p">Those had been Suzuka's words from just a few days ago. She had spoken with a grim determination only to break down into anxious tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">-That's impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">That had been his response then.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had not intended on giving Suzuka the chance. He had turned her down, plainly and unambiguously, but she had just once again declared that she would keep it up until she was given a chance and would never give up. The conversation left Riku all the more perturbed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That unbridled passion made his determination falter slightly. After all, his heart was devoid of any passion at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now, Suzuka, ignoring how gloomy he was looking, unwrapped the packaging from the steamed bread and started eating.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hmm... Pretty nice. The cocoa's sweet, and the bread soft. Yeah, it's great! Too bad you don't get to eat this, Arimura." Her resilience was really impressive.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe if he went out with her for just a few moments, she would give up after a while…</p>
<p class="null-p">After all, Suzuka had never been able to read the mood and Riku was tired of shooing her away all the time by now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Speaking of which, about the house that 'fairy' granny stayed at," she said out of the blue as if she recalled something.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku was quietly alarmed by the words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't there a girl staying there? Heard it's the granny's relative." "..."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I met that girl at the school gates." Riku's heart jolted.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl Suzuka spoke of was the girl at the villa, the very same that Riku had been meeting every morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka met her at the school gates?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was she here?</p>
<p class="null-p">"She was gawking at the school like she never seen one before. Does she think that a countryside school is a rare sight or something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka's words echoed in the emptiness of his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did that girl come to see him? No, that was impossible. Surely, it was a pure coincidence she happened to pass by.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's heart wanted this to be true and false at the same time. His throat felt parched. He deliberately maintained his usual tense expression, not wanting Suzuka to notice how rattled he was.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the meanwhile, his classmate continued to chew and talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's soooo obvious that she's a rich kid. I have heard already that the princess has long black hair, but her skin's so white too. It's like she never suntanned in her life. She looks thin and graceful, you know? She's like a person from another world, completely unlike us."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's head immediately cooled down.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was so firmly in control that the lapse of heart from just a moment ago seemed like a lie.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Yeah, she's different from us.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Just as Suzuka had said, she was someone living in another world.</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">A sense of futility was slowly growing within him.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What exactly am I hoping for?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku was merely a newspaper delivery boy. The girl was simply a princess living at the delivery location. That was the extent of their relationship.</p>
<p class="null-p">He callously grabbed the steamed bread from the table. Suzuka looked up at him in surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ignoring that, he unwrapped the food and bit into it quietly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rich sweetness and texture were threatening to stuff his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">He scowled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...When does the concert start?" he asked with a growl.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today, I went to Riku-kun's middle school. I walked around the walls, looking for Riku-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was nighttime and Chise was writing on a letter paper with a floral pattern she had bought earlier. The message was meant for Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the seventh such missive, neither of them had an address.</p>
<p class="null-p">The six previous ones had all been put in similar envelopes and stored inside cookie jars. The cookie jars were gold and blue, very pretty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There are rows of sakura trees on the school grounds. When Spring comes, the petals will dance with the wind. It will definitely look pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right now, I am imagining Riku-kun reading there, eating a bento, chatting with friends. The thoughts I kept thinking, they were all about you, Riku-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I brushed past a female student at the school gates. She was pretty with a nice figure. She looked about the same age as you, Riku-kun. If only I were studying at the same school as you… I do feel a little lonely thinking about this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise folded the letter cautiously and inserted it into the envelope.</p>
<p class="null-p">(If I do end up studying at the same school as Riku-kun, I may have more chances to talk to him,) she thought quietly while putting it away.</p>
<p class="null-p">If both of them could be in the same class, they could probably enjoy school activities together, things like sports, the culture festival, and so on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or she could end up being her usual timid self, only daring to watch him from afar.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, surely, it would be a 'pleasant', 'wonderful' experience to be together in the same school as Riku-kun...</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise laid on the bed, and closed her eyes, continuing to imagine these scenes, feeling very blessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Again, she quietly recited the poem in her mind. The lines Shiori-san wrote inside in the sky blue diary with a white flower sewn onto it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The sun darkened because of him."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who exactly is he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A deliverer of mysterious letters."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Who exactly is he?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My heart is about to melt."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning, it rained.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise wore her blue rain boots and held a red umbrella as she awaited Riku's arrival.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy appeared soon, dressed in a black hooded raincoat. Once he saw Chise standing by the postbox, he frowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go-good morning. It is raining. Must be hard on you," she spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not at all," he growled in reply.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he bit his lips lightly, averted his eyes, handed the newspapers over, and immediately pedaled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">And even as Chise thanked him, he did not look back.</p>
<p class="null-p">The raindrops landed upon the umbrella with a quiet thrum. Chise heard them and felt sad, her heart turning into a frozen block.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku was shunning her after all.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I suppose me coming out to wait for newspapers... caused him trouble after</p>
<p class="null-p">all...)</p>
<p class="null-p">That must have been why he was unwilling to look Chise in the eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She lost all strength and returned to the villa dejectedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She remained in the room on the second floor and, even as she flipped through the pages reading the reports, her heart remained cold and heavy. She started to wonder about the reasons for Riku's behavior.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Maybe me talking to Riku-kun is obstructing his work, or maybe he found it a bother than I am personally receiving the newspaper from him every day?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Midway through, Chise gave up on reading and instead started up the sewing machine to continue the work on the dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">While sewing, she felt the needle stab at her chest too, so very painful and sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rain continued for several days.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every day, Chise, with the umbrella in hand, was waiting for Riku who would deliver the newspaper with an unchanging scowl and pedal off. Chise was feeling spent just from thanking him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The unfinished newspapers lay in a growing stack in a corner of the room and the dress was midway done. Even when Andou-san was teaching Chise housework, the girl had been listless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san had assumed that Chise was like this because her parents could not come.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's parents had left her at the villa so that they could discuss porce. It appeared Andou-san had known about this, probably directly from them. She really sympathized with Chise's plight, always trying to cook her favorite dishes, or inviting Chise along to make cookies and pies.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise stopped writing to her family and friends. If she tried to continue, she would simply end up venting. Receiving such letters would only make everyone feel uncomfortable and cause them trouble.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had to smile, but she could not.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had lots of summer plans, but nothing to actually do so she kept spacing out by the bedside, listening to the raindrops.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were lots of frozen melon buns and baumkuchen in the freezer. She ate one of these desserts to kill time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had expected the frozen bread to be rock hard but the opposite to be true. The moment she bit into one, the filling would flow around her teeth.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rain caused the temperature outside to drop gradually. The cooling air, coupled with the frosted desserts, left her freezing cold, but her mouth at least was filled with sweetness. Surely, the marvelous taste would but all the more delicious if she ate it while it was hot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while she was sitting in the kitchen downhearted, Andou-san gave her a ticket.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The department store organized a firefly exhibition. The season for them has passed already, but there still should be many photos of them on display. You'll definitely enjoy it."</p>
<p class="null-p">She would only cause Andou-san to worry if she kept lounging around like this so she tied her hair, put on her knee-length dress, and left for the village.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rainboots really did not match the clothing. Thus, Chise wore the brown shoes instead of the sandals so that the mud stains on them would not be obvious.</p>
<p class="null-p">The event was held at the roof of the department store.</p>
<p class="null-p">The space was larger than Chise had expected. The title of the exhibition was 'Firefly Village'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides the photos of the fireflies, there were many others depicting the daylight sceneries. Just as Andou-san had said, one could see the various scenes of this village here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise recognized the brook, the path, the forest.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the photo, the fireflies rested atop the fine leaves, giving off a tender glow and looking really pretty.</p>
<p class="null-p">There also were a few photos depicting fireflies dancing above the water surface, looking really fleeting. Chise paused next to those and was immediately mesmerized.</p>
<p class="null-p">(So pretty...)</p>
<p class="null-p">They resembled dancing stars.</p>
<p class="null-p">And of all the photos, the one Chise stopped at for the longest time was that of a marsh surrounded by forests with the dazzling fireflies fluttering above.</p>
<p class="null-p">Countless fireflies illuminated the surface of the water causing it to dazzle. She couldn't tell if it was the effect of the camera or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori-san's diary too mentioned that the first time she met her lover had been near the swamp.</p>
<p class="null-p">At night, many fireflies seemed to gather there. But back then, under the bright afternoon sun, the only living thing visible was a white-skinned man with tender eyes, seated by the water, reading.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Maybe the swamp in the photo is the place Shiori-san met her lover?) Chise looked at the tagline of the photograph.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Cowherd and the Fairy," it said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was startled.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Fairy?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san once said that Shiori-san was called the 'fairy'.</p>
<p class="null-p">It might have been a coincidence. But at the same time, even though the tagline seemed unrelated to the photo of the fireflies, there certainly was a special connection.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweet images appeared in her mind one by one, and Chise's heart raced.</p>
<p class="null-p">She imagined the multitude of fireflies flickering, fluttering about, their lights fading in and out. And under such an ambiance Shiori-san watched her beloved with a happy smile on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had never met Shiori before, but her mind was somehow able to visualize the aunt's appearance so clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps it was because the diary mentioned, "he praised me, saying 'You're so small and cute, Shiori. I love the large round eyes and the low nose. The red kimono today suits you very well.'"</p>
<p class="null-p">A petite girl in a red kimono, looking innocent with a shy smile on her lips. Yes. Surely, Shiori-san was such a person.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise looked at the photo and felt her chest throbbing, her cheeks burning, her thoughts in unison with Shiori-san.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had really loved him. That was why she had gone to the marshes, to meet him as he had been always reading there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Initially, Shiori-san was sighing in bliss just from the glances of him she had caught from behind the trees.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori had always been scared of stepping out into the open. Until, on a certain day, he had suddenly taken the initiative and spoken to her. That had elevated her to cloud nine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess that is what it means to be on cloud nine. I started to fall in love with that man, unable to stop."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thinking about him, my heart has only space for fluttering fireflies. I am really, really, really happy to think that I can meet him again the next day."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's could almost hear Shiori-san's voice in her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sickeningly sweet voice filled with delight.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Shiori-san might have never gotten to be with her lover... But she really loved him...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise started to think that this much was enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like in the 'Cowherd and the Fairy'. If she could ever fall in love, experience a pretty, warm, fairy-tale-like romance, surely she would be really blessed. So blessed, in fact, that she could ask for nothing more.</p>
<p class="null-p">At this moment, Chise suddenly thought of the tanned, aloof face that filled her world whenever Riku handed over the newspaper to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart immediately turned cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun and I are not friends, let alone lovers...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori-san had only dared to hide among the trees, watching the object of her yearning read at the swamp. Like her, Chise dared not to take the first step.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, that wasn't true. She had taken that step once, and felt their hearts got closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">But as things were, Riku was drifting away from Chise again.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she dared to take another step, would the distance between them shrink once again?</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she want to do so?</p>
<p class="null-p">Half of August had passed already.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise could stay in the villa only for another week or so.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I might have done something to annoy Riku-kun. But... It will feel lonely if I have to leave like this...)</p>
<p class="null-p">What should Chise do to get Riku to look at her once again?</p>
<p class="null-p">What should Chise do so that Riku would be willing to talk for a short moment, just like before?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just this should be enough to satisfy her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise purchased an exhibit book and left the venue. Absentmindedly, she visited the animestation, the stationery store, and the local food shops. She purchased some jelly for Andou-san. By the time she left the department store, it was evening and the skies began to darken.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rain stopped. Surely, the weather tomorrow would be fine.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Thank goodness...if it rained, Riku-kun would have a hard time delivering newspapers...)</p>
<p class="null-p">She would try to converse with Riku this morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">While she waited for the bus at the stop, she browsed through the book.</p>
<p class="null-p">It introduced the portfolios of a few of the photographers whose works were on display. The one who took the photo titled 'The Cowherd and the Fairy' was already dead for at least ten years. The tagline was borrowed from a novel written by Kanoko Okamoto.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I shall have a look at it next time...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Right at that moment, she heard a girl chatting and laughing away.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound came from the other end of the street, from where a boy and a girl of roughly the same age as Chise were slowly approaching.</p>
<p class="null-p">The boy was pushing the bicycle and looked quite gloomy. The chatty girl was walking next to him, holding the boy's hand. The boy attempted to shake her off, but she just said ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. We're out on a date anyway."</p>
<p class="null-p">- and latched herself onto the boy's arm once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Chise's and the boy's gazes met.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/riku-and-chise_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's eyes widened from shock and Riku too looked surprised.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl latching onto Riku was the one Chise had met in front of the middle school, the one brushed by her. Chise vividly remembered her pretty looks and nice figure. This evening the girl was dressed in a very alluring combination of tank-top and shorts.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Is she Riku-kun's girlfriend? Did he have one?)</p>
<p class="null-p">And she looked so pretty, with a lively personality to boot. She was the complete opposite of Chise...</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku was mature, it would not be strange for him to have a girlfriend. However, Chise had never considered this possibility before.</p>
<p class="null-p">With reality suddenly laid out before her, she realized that her emotions were simply innocent delusions. The shame and disappointment left her ears red.</p>
<p class="null-p">She shriveled, lowered her head, and looked at her feet. Riku did not walk up to talk to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before we go to the concert, I want to have a hamburger."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's sweet voice wormed its way into Chise's ears as the duo passed the bus stop by.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise held onto the book firmly and kept praying, hoping that Riku and his girlfriend would leave quickly.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">"That girl waiting at the bus stop was the Princess from Tokyo. Do you know her, Arimura?" asked Suzuka, looking displeased.</p>
<p class="null-p">The duo ordered a hamburger set at a fast food restaurant and she asked the question with a pout the moment they sat down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until they entered the shop, she had been grabbing onto Riku's arm, rubbing her face on his shoulder, leaning her body against his. But now even her voice turned frosty.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You do, don't you?" she asked again, furious, before he could even answer. "I can tell that you're acting strangely, Arimura. You and that girl. That girl was waiting for you outside school because she wanted to see you, right? What's your relationship with her?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I just deliver newspapers to the villa every morning." Riku was scowling, his tone sounding grim.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing else...other than that."</p>
<p class="null-p">His expression and tone remained icy, stiff even. Suzuka seemed a little intimidated by that and said nothing more, just watching him with worry in her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">But just containing his frustration right now took a massive effort and Riku was in no mood to bother about Suzuka.</p>
<p class="null-p">He never expected that the girl would see Suzuka walk with him hand in hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">But he had accepted Suzuka's invitation out of his own will. The girl from the villa lived in a different world from him. He would never be able to comprehend her kindness and innocence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely the girl would treat anyone as earnestly and innocently as she had been treating Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">This had been how he kept trying to convince himself while trying his best to avoid contact with the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, just now, the girl had seen Suzuka holding Riku's hand and she had seemed stunned by the sight. Seeing her like this had rattled him greatly.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt as though the ground was slipping from under his feet. Various excuses swirled in his mind, but his throat was stiff and he was unable to speak up.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, if he did utter an excuse, that would only make him all the more despicable, false.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl from the villa was neither Riku's lover nor a friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew that very well but, all the same, there seemed to be a strange presence within his body that kept destroying his inner peace, never allowing his frustrations to subside.</p>
<p class="null-p">And while he was struggling with his feeling like this ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're kidding... You're really dating Arimura? That's amazing, Suzukachan!"</p>
<p class="null-p">- a few of his female classmates suddenly appeared.</p>
<p class="null-p">This group of girls had always been tight with Suzuka, of a type that also garnered lots of attention.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait! Why are you..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka panicked and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why? Suzuka-chan, didn't you send us all a message-full of emoticons with the bombshell that you'll be going out on a date with Arimura? We were at the game center nearby anyway so we thought we should have a look."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, yeah. I ain't believing that you're wooing Arimura unless I see it with my own eyes. I always thought you wouldn't pull it off."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Same here. I thought that even if it's you, there's no way you could get Arimura, Suzuka-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's Suzuka-chan for you. You boasted that you'll get Arimura this summer and you certainly did it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ehh, looks like Suzuka-chan's the only winner in the end."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her friends were teasing her full-force -</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-enough. I'm not... Eh! Anyway, just leave. Don't disturb us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">- and she tried to shoo them off when she heard a chair being moved.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked back at Riku and saw he had stood up without a word.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Arimura...t-that, this..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku dropped the ticket Suzuka gave him onto the table.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I just remembered I had something else planned. Go bring a friend along," he hissed before turning away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka's friends started to yap over one another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-wait, Arimura, you're angry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Didn't you want to listen to this, Koyama-chan?" Suzuka hurried out of the shop after Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Arimura, wait...! The bet was, just my carelessness... For a long while now, I... Arimura ‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">She desperately grabbed Riku's arm but he shook her off adamantly, leaving her dumbstruck.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It just doesn't feel right whenever a female touches me. You should leave me be, from now on. I'll do that too."</p>
<p class="null-p">With these words, Riku hopped onto the bicycle and sped off.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bicycle smashed through the warm breeze as Riku pedaled hard. Pure rage was roaring in his throat, ravaging his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was the source Suzuka and her friends? A disgust towards himself? Riku could not tell.</p>
<p class="null-p">He knew well that Suzuka had been trying to get him interested in her because he showed no interest in girls. Her friends often joked about romance. Riku himself had no feelings for Suzuka and did not feel that he was somehow fooled.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had understood her intentions. He deliberately chose to accept her invitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it had undoubtedly come at the worst possible moment. Riku was dissatisfied with his current situation and disgusted at his useless mother. While he had swallowed Suzuka's bait, he had always thought of Suzuka as a bad person and ultimately ran away. In the end, he had no idea of what he wanted. His own incompetence appalled him. The ugly jumble of emotions brought the urge to curse everyone on this world.</p>
<p class="null-p">The damp air gripped his throat and arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">He struggled for breath.</p>
<p class="null-p">His boiling head would not cool down.</p>
<p class="null-p">The evening sky got darker and Riku raced head-on into the embrace of the looming darkness. Before he realized it, it arrived in front of the old villa overgrown by ivy.</p>
<p class="null-p">The room on the second floor was lit up. He looked up at the window. His heart seized up.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the girl's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank goodness... She made it back home safely.</p>
<p class="null-p">The shine was vaguely making it through the curtains. Riku looked up at the gentle light, his mind slowly going back to normal, his maddening heart calming down. What replaced the frenzy was sadness rising up from the depths of his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to see her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once he did, he wanted to apologize for his standoffishness, to explain why he was holding hands with Suzuka.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even if he did apologize and gave his justifications, what then? Riku could hear his own admonishments ring in his ears. That girl was the Princess from the Villa, someone different from him. She had parents. Once the summer ended, she would return to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Are you going to corrupt that girl with those ugly emotions of yours?)</p>
<p class="null-p">At dusk, the girl had been standing at the station, eyes widened, in shock at what she had seen him do.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Riku and Suzuka, hand holding hand, passed next to her, she gripped her book tightly and in sad silence lowered her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku did not want the girl to make that face ever again.</p>
<p class="null-p">That girl, and only her, was the single person in his life Riku did not want to hurt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Full of apprehension and hurt, Riku kept staring at the light in the girl's room.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The following morning, while the sky was still a little dark,</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise stood next to the postbox looking a little sleepless and a little red around the eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The previous night, after she had returned home, she switched the lights on in her room and, lying sprawled on the bed, thought about Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku had a girlfriend.</p>
<p class="null-p">He would be annoyed if Chise kept waiting for him like she had.</p>
<p class="null-p">But when she received the newspapers from his hands, it always warmed her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">That day, when she had received a call from her mother and learned that her parents were going to porce, it had been thanks to Riku, who had delivered the newspapers the following morning, that Chise was once again able to smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">For that at least, until the very end, Chise wanted to thank him.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would not hope to be closer to him ever again. She just hoped to be still able to personally receive the newspapers while she was here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, she was going to play dumb in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">At least she had convinced herself she would do so while looking in the direction Riku always came from.</p>
<p class="null-p">And when the light shone from behind the peak, Riku appeared on the bicycle as always.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise took a deep breath, motivating herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I have to...give a proper smile.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks were tense, though, unable to move. This would not do.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku stopped the bicycle in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was worried that Riku would mention what had happened the previous day. However, he kept his mouth shut, silently drew out the newspapers, and handed them over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise received them gladly, lifting the tips of her lips up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She bowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku too lowered his head slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, he turned his eyes aside and pedaled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I just about managed to receive the newspapers without incident... but I cannot be smiling weakly like that. I have to offer a happier smile tomorrow...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise gently brought the newspapers to her face. There was still some lingering warmth there.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">On the following day, and the day after, their interaction remained awkward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku would keep his mouth shut, handing over the newspaper with a grim look on his face. Chise would receive it with a stiff smile, a lowered head, and a simple, "Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Then the boy would bow and depart slowly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The heavy atmosphere would not lift for as long as Riku could be seen. Chise could muster nothing more than her thanks.</p>
<p class="null-p">(...I guess I caused trouble for Riku-kun after all. I made him unhappy...) It might be better for her not to keep waiting.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past, whenever Chise had seen Riku, her heart would feel fuzzy. Now however, seeing him just caused it to suffer spasms of pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was in no mood to read the papers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise returned to her room, feeling downhearted as she flipped through Shiori-san's diary. The romance recorded in there was bright and clear like the summer sunshine. It captivated her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">But unlike the previous times she had read it, today Chise found a white envelope within the sky-blue cover of the book.</p>
<p class="null-p">She removed the missive and had a look at it. It was blank, no recipient's name or address was written.</p>
<p class="null-p">Initially, Chise felt the same kind of apprehension as when she had first opened the diary and hesitated for a long time. But in the end, she could not restrain her curiosity and opened it. There were two letters inside, both filled with Shiori-san's handwriting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To the dearest you:"</p>
<p class="null-p">Those words opened the missive. Chise held her breath as she kept reading.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This Summer, you have taught me lots of things.</p>
<p class="null-p">How pretty the color of the evening sun was as it set down between the mountains to the West. How passionate the scent of the green grass in the blooming summer could be. How the gentle colors of the starry night were all too dazzling. I knew nothing at all until this Summer came.</p>
<p class="null-p">I did not even know that there is such a beautiful place in this village I grew up in."</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a letter Shiori-san had written to her lover.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no address on the envelope because she had most likely never intended to have it sent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like the several letters Chise had written to Riku that had never been posted.</p>
<p class="null-p">She simply wanted to store her overflowing emotions somewhere, to store them... like this...</p>
<p class="null-p">"The world is so vibrant, and I have found everything in it so moving, but all I saw in those eyes all this time has been your lonely self.</p>
<p class="null-p">During this Summer, we were always together, Like Vega and Altair, so pure, so full of bliss.</p>
<p class="null-p">And even though the memories in my heart will stay forever,</p>
<p class="null-p">Summer is about to come to an end."</p>
<p class="null-p">(The Cowherd... and the Fairy!)</p>
<p class="null-p">These words were the same as the tagline for the photograph of the firefly swamp. Chise's heart jolted once she saw this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe, the person who took this photo was Shiori-san's...</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thus-"</p>
<p class="null-p">The first letter ended with this line. Chise had a look at the second and gasped once again.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was just one line of words on the page.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We shall have to say goodbye."</p>
<p class="null-p">The warmth in Chise's thoughts suddenly boiled over the top of her head. She was so shocked by these final words that she was unable to move.</p>
<p class="null-p">When had Shiori-san written these letters? When her lover had been about to leave the village? Or when she had stopped waiting for him to return? Chise would never know.</p>
<p class="null-p">But from the line 'we shall have to say goodbye', Chise felt various emotions tugging at her heartstrings...</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time, Chise realized that her own farewell was imminent.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Once the summer ends, I will never get to see Riku-kun again.)</p>
<p class="null-p">It was inevitable. But surely, if she was to give Riku a frosty smile for that farewell, she would surely be left with much regret.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, she would be neither able to read the newspapers Riku delivered nor the clippings in the sketchbook with much enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise once again began to work on the half-made dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every day, little by little, she worked at the machine, sewing the seams, adding lace to the sleeves, affixing buttons. The dress was nearing completion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her interactions with Riku remained awkward. However, on her last day, she wanted to wear this sky blue dress and receive the newspaper from Riku's hands with a genuine smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was time to put on the straw hat again.</p>
<p class="null-p">For that memorable hat was what had led to their encounter.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku would spend his afternoons in the clubroom and only return to the cramped apartment for the night. He kept drawing the girl. On the sketchbook, on the backs of the adverts, on marketing printouts. Over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had been a while since he had spoken to the girl. Whenever he handed the newspapers to her, he would avert his eyes to avoid looking her in the eyes and leave promptly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever he returned from school, his drunk mother would always await him in the apartment filled with the foul stench of booze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you," she would say, clinging to him. "I really do love you. Just you alone, Riku."</p>
<p class="null-p">She would repeat this ad nauseam.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why aren't you smiling? Why aren't you kinder towards me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">One time, she clawed marks into Riku's shoulders with her fingernails, before wailing in agony.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really despise me. You really hate me, don't you? You just think of me as a bitch who gave birth to a kid not knowing who the father is, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku never waved off his mother's arms but never refuted either. He merely emptied his heart and let her do as she pleased. Like a puppet.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since Riku returned the ticket to Suzuka, the girl had never returned to the clubroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, he remained secluded in that quiet place, just drawing.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not need to know the name of the girl from the villa.</p>
<p class="null-p">For that girl, he was merely an aloof newspaper delivery boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">But even so, he could continue to draw her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">For as long as she remained there, he just wanted to draw more of her. Even if that would be one more picture.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Summer was ending.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the day of farewell crept close.</p>
<p class="null-p">Two days before she was due to return home, Chise finally finished the dress. "Done."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise knelt on the floor, her hands laying out her handiwork.</p>
<p class="null-p">The refreshing blue color looked like a piece cut from the sky when illuminated by the ceiling lights. The white lace on the sleeves and the puffy frills were pretty, the buttons glittered happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise got up, stood before the mirror, and measured the dress against herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The gather at the waist curled into a pretty wave.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Thank goodness...I made it.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Recently, the smile on her lips had been pretty forced. Even on the mirror's surface, her happiness looked rather unconvincing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but what if the size is wrong?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right, the dress remained incomplete until she tried it on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise fumbled about attempting to undress when an uplifting melody rang from the cellphone on the desk.</p>
<p class="null-p">She put her half-removed indoor garments back on again and picked up the handset.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Father...)</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, her heart went cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">When her mother had called the last time, she had said, "I will you get that man to call you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted Chise to decide whose family name she was going to take. ‐‐You are an adult. You can decide on your own.</p>
<p class="null-p">The harsh words returned to her with the force of a pitch black torrent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had never forgotten those words and, on the rare occasions they had come back to haunt her, she had felt her heart being squeezed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ever since that day, her parents had never contacted her. She had assumed that once she returned home, the three of them would have a meeting together and she would be told her straight to the face.</p>
<p class="null-p">She thought that as long as she stayed in this villa, she could feel some relief.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had to hurry and pick up the phone.</p>
<p class="null-p">But a shiver rose all the way from the hand holding the handset, to nape of her neck. She felt a momentary impulse to toss the phone out.</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not want to hear those ugly words... Not in this place filled with warmth.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the phone kept ringing. With trembling fingers, Chise pressed the button.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chise? This is father."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise shriveled. That terrifying, vengeful growl grated in her ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Two days from now, in the evening, I'll send for a car to collect you. The porce settlement has been submitted today."</p>
<p class="null-p">A sharp stab of pain pierced through her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her father continued and it was clear he was furious.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You shall not see that woman again. She hired men to move out all the furniture she liked. She also said that she was not willing to raise you. That since you do not need a mother at this age, I can raise you myself." The words griped Chise's heart in a brutal vise, crushing it to bits.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ You are an adult. You can decide on your own.</p>
<p class="null-p">These had been her mother's very own words, yet she was unwilling to take Chise along. Instantly, the world turned dark in front of the girl's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"She threw the daughter at me. Dared to hire a lawyer. The... nerve of that woman."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mother dumped Chise's care on her father and the man was seething.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was simply baggage to both her mother and her father!</p>
<p class="null-p">"That woman sought the porce now because she was waiting for this chance, the moment when she could squeeze the most money from me. I had intended for the house you are living at to be used as a resort, but now I have to sell it to raise funds for the settlement fee. All the effort put into the renovation went to waste just like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her father's words crushed her over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew the relationship between her parents was beyond frosty.</p>
<p class="null-p">She knew they despised each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">But her father had never ever lambasted her mother so brazenly in the open before.</p>
<p class="null-p">She did not want to hear any of this.</p>
<p class="null-p">(And this house... will be sold!)</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way she could ever return.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had hoped to return to this village for the next Summer, that she might be able to meet Riku again. And now, this wish was cruelly crushed. The future scenery of the morning sun faintly peeking from behind the peak, of the skinny boy riding a bicycle, was fading away, vanishing into the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once her father hung up, despair came like a black tide, savaging her heart over and over again. She fell to her knees, unable to get up.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once her parents got porced, their family of three would disappear!</p>
<p class="null-p">She would never be able to return to this warm place again!</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Once Riku finished delivering the evening newspapers, he found the door ajar when he returned to his apartment. His mother had disappeared. Again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The place was full of scattered cutlery, bento bags, and shoddily discarded worn female garments. However, the stacks of branded cosmetics and nail care utensils, once lying all over the floor, had vanished completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing this familiar scene, Riku realized his mother had left home. Again.</p>
<p class="null-p">She found a new man. Again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just the previous night, she had clung to him firmly and wailed, "Riku, I love you." The scratch marks still lingered painfully on his shoulders and arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐ I love you. I really do love you, just you alone, Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had never believed those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">But whenever his mother left, there would be an incorrigible emptiness sweeping through his body. His heart would turn parched like the desert, hollow.</p>
<p class="null-p">He lacked the strength to clean the messy room, so he slid down the front door, and sat down on the floor.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was surely going to repeat itself many, many times. Until one of them died...</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Like fish washed ashore, flopping, Chise was gasping for breath. She sat before the desk, intending to write a letter to her friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her mind was filled with 'enjoyable', 'wonderful' memories, 'very happy' thoughts. She was looking forward to the end of summer vacation, eager to see her friends at school...</p>
<p class="null-p">But the moment, she prepared the pink envelope and the colorful pens, she could not put any strength into her fingers, and she was unable to even grip the pens.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Smile.)</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be troublesome for everyone if she made a gloomy face.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I must smile.)</p>
<p class="null-p">She kept trying to force the lips to curl, but she just could not. (Why am I unable to smile? I have to. If I do not, I am worth nothing!) Perhaps her smile was just frozen right there on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">She simply hoped to maintain that smile but, in reality, she just could not bring herself to do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, even when she was with her parents, the house was often dark and gloomy and could not comfort her parents' hearts.</p>
<p class="null-p">(That is why... Father and Mother do not need me.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's heart felt like it was being cut by a thousand blades. She could only reproach herself over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Even though I am their child, I cannot bind them together!)</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku laid out the sketchbook in the dirty room, but his eyes remained hollow, his heart parched and frosty.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sunlight had once shone upon his world but, at this point, it was like a newspaper page, grey and crude.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once again, he was abandoned by his mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">When would she return again? He did not know.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she might never do so.</p>
<p class="null-p">But there was nary a tinge of sadness in Riku's heart, just nothingness, and creeping ice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Color was fading away from his world.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could not draw.</p>
<p class="null-p">All that he wanted to draw, those beautiful things, was gone to him.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise remained in the room covered behind the grassy-green curtains, her arms sprawled on the desk as she brooded in silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even her parents, blood of her blood, did not love her. Was anyone willing to love such a child?</p>
<p class="null-p">She couldn't make even a humble smile. Was there anyone who really needed her?</p>
<p class="null-p">Just one person would do.</p>
<p class="null-p">One such person might be able to soothe this lacerating pain.</p>
<p class="null-p">She might have once thought that she was a needed person.</p>
<p class="null-p">But that person from her thoughts had never existed.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Because I have been lying. I did not want to smile, but I still did. Everyone knows... Everyone has already noticed that I am just a liar.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was it that even in such a moment, she was unable to cry?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why was it that even though she was in this much agony, she intended to smile?</p>
<p class="null-p">Why did she delude herself, thinking that if her smile was perfect, people would love her?</p>
<p class="null-p">That was impossible, to begin with.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But... I cannot cry... I cannot cry at all... The tears are not coming out..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku leaned weakly on the sliding door covered by brown stains, looking down at the white, pristine sketchbook that was tossed away onto the tatamis, and fell into quiet contemplation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he was abandoned by his mother, he felt nothing. Was anyone willing to love this cold-hearted boy? Would he be able to meet a person, just one, a mere thought of whom could cause his heart to flutter? One who would cause his heart to soften? One he would not want to lose?</p>
<p class="null-p">Could he really find in himself a sincere smile for such a person?</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how he tried to visualize it, his heart remained unmoved.</p>
<p class="null-p">His mind was simply thinking about himself. He was in the middle of an endless desert, stone-faced, walking on like a doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much he was begged for a smile, he just could not.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I'm definitely destined not to smile in this life."</p>
<p class="null-p">A figure, a tanned boy, appeared in Chise's eyes amidst the dazzling morning light. He was riding a bicycle, delivering newspapers with a stoic face.</p>
<p class="null-p">The long, slender arms handing over warm newspapers...</p>
<p class="null-p">There was an apprehensive girl with long black hair, standing bashfully next to the postbox, waiting for Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would cautiously receive the newspapers from Riku's hands. With her soft, delightful voice, she would offer thanks and bow elegantly...</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun is different from me. He works to help his family financially, and his mother needs him...)</p>
<p class="null-p">(That girl is different from me. She's born to a wonderful family, an innocent princess with good parents raising her.)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun must be living together with his mother, enjoying their life together.)</p>
<p class="null-p">(That girl definitely lives in a kind and stable world. Her family must really love her.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Once such thoughts crossed their minds, they felt redeemed.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how cruel the worlds they lived in were, no matter how useless she was, how flawed he was, this life was not all cruel, dark and distorted. There existed kind, pure people. There still were people who were needed and loved by others.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I hope Riku-kun,-)</p>
<p class="null-p">(I hope that girl,-)</p>
<p class="null-p">(-will be happy. I really hope so.)</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/riku-and-chise_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">As long as 'he' was happy, she could have hope, could believe that there was God in this world, who had various delights and wonderful things prepared.</p>
<p class="null-p">As long as 'she' was happy, he could believe that this world still harbored beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was fine with living a tragic life.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was fine with being flawed.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, s|he hoped that the other would be free of pain, sadness, and be surrounded by tenderness and love.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the brink of collapse, Chise thought of Riku and Riku thought of the girl at the villa. They silently prayed for each other's happiness. The cold night passed, just like that.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The following day was so cold that it felt as though Autumn had arrived early. The dark clouds were as heavy as lead. It was raining. The rain too was very cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise spent the entire night sprawled over the table and then collapsed onto the bed with a fever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her face was searing, her breathing frantic. Andou-san took the icy towel and put it over Chise's forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll go buy some fever patches from the pharmacy. It'll be easier for you to turn around in bed."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise apologized feebly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It is fine. It doesn't seem like flu. Have a good rest, and you'll feel much better tomorrow when you return home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san narrowed her eyes gently and left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a newspaper laying on the little bedside table.</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san knew that Chise had always been looking forward to the content of the newspaper. She brought it to the room for Chise so that the girl could have a look at it once she felt better.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I can only stay for another two days… yet I could not receive the newspapers from Riku-kun today...)</p>
<p class="null-p">If she was not around, what would Riku think?</p>
<p class="null-p">Maybe he would feel relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rain kept pouring and even the sound it made seemed so cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Is Riku-kun done with delivering the newspapers...?)</p>
<p class="null-p">If it kept raining, Riku would end up drenched, and the bicycle tires would be slippery. It would be dangerous. She hoped the rain would stop before tomorrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">(God …please do not let Riku-kun suffer.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise closed her eyes and kept thinking about Riku.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">(Didn't see her today.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Once he was done delivering the morning newspapers, Riku returned to the shop and removed his drenched raincoat. The shop owner appeared and informed Riku that the following day would be the last time Riku would deliver newspapers to that villa.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, the Princess living there would be returning to Tokyo.</p>
<p class="null-p">The estate agent said the villa might end up being sold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those two messages left Riku's heart in a lurch.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that girl did not wait at the postbox because she was preparing to return to Tokyo?</p>
<p class="null-p">If the villa was to be sold to someone else, he might not get to see the bashful, gentle silhouette ever again.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You seem to be getting on well with the Princess?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain person might have seen him talk to the girl, and informed his boss. "She's not someone you can just reach for. You'll have to deliver to that place for the last time tomorrow, but you must cut yourself away from her," warned the man without flinching.</p>
<p class="null-p">"..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku understood that well. "...I have nothing to do with her." His voice was flat.</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">(Tomorrow...will be the last day I get to see Riku-kun...I have to wake up early, and personally receive the newspapers from his hands...) Chise's face and body remained hot throughout the night.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lights were switched off and the room was dark. Chise kept looking towards the clock at her side from time to time.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I have to smile...and thank him...for the last time...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she knew it, Chise fell asleep. Once she opened her eyes however, the bright sunlight shone through the curtains by her bedside, illuminating the entire room.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a panic, she jumped from the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">She opened the grassy green curtains aside and looked towards the courtyard. The sun had already risen.</p>
<p class="null-p">She looked towards the clock, and once she saw the hour hand pointing towards 7, she gasped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seven in the morning!</p>
<p class="null-p">It was long past the newspaper delivery time.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I did set the alarm at 4.30am. Why!?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she oversleep and accidentally mute the alarm clock?</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past, she had used to wake up before it rang.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise draped a coat over her pajamas, put on her glasses, opened the door, and hurried down the stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body was still heavy, and she was a little hot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise slipped on her shoes, and ran towards the postbox, nearly tripping along the way. Once she saw the newspaper stuffed into the postbox, her heart turned cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I did not make it...)</p>
<p class="null-p">She never got to receive the last newspapers from Riku's hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I will never get to see Riku-kun again...) Chise choked, her legs wobbled.</p>
<p class="null-p">She timidly withdrew the newspapers from the postbox. It had long turned cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">She returned to the villa, holding the newspapers like a corpse.</p>
<p class="null-p">Andou-san welcomed her in the hallway.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh dear, Chise-san. Why did you run out while dressed like this? If you really wanted to read the papers, I could have retrieved it had you told me." So she said, and touched Chise's forehead, before finally looking relieved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks like the fever has subsided. I have prepared most of your luggage, Chise-san. You can spend the time until the evening however you want. Breakfast is fine, no? I'll prepare it for you then. You should go wash your face and change your clothes…Chise-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise hugged the newspapers, shivering. Andou-san immediately frowned.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the matter? Chise-san, are you feeling unwell elsewhere?"</p>
<p class="null-p">(I want to see Riku-kun...)</p>
<p class="null-p">(In any case, I want to meet him, and thank him.)</p>
<p class="null-p">(I know this will only cause him trouble.)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Even so... Just one last time...)</p>
<p class="null-p">The hands clutching the newspapers suddenly clenched tight and she eked out a request.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Andou-san...please tell me where Riku-kun's house is...!"</p>
<p class="null-h1">Chapter 5</p>
<p class="null-h2">The Farewell at the Age of 15</p>
<p class="null-p">(It's the last day… but I haven't seen that girl...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku was done delivering newspapers and returned to the shop to collect his pay.</p>
<p class="null-p">His mind was thinking about the girl at the villa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Today was the last day he would deliver newspapers to that house.</p>
<p class="null-p">But he had not seen the apprehensive-looking, long-haired girl standing by the postbox.</p>
<p class="null-p">And even if he had, he could only deliver the newspapers to her without a word.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Riku felt weak at the thought that he would never get to see that girl again. Somehow, the world around him seemed blurry and devoid of color.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the feeling of emptiness in his heart, Riku headed off towards the school.</p>
<p class="null-p">He went into the clubroom alone and opened the sketchbook. The drawing of the girl on the page was smiling at Riku bashfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">For every page he flipped, there was a variation of her. There was her wearing glasses, her blushing as she lifted her eyes up to meet his, or her with braids, her with eyes wide, or her there bowing deeply towards him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Heart aching, Riku continued to flip through these illustrations. At this</p>
<p class="null-p">moment ‐‐</p>
<p class="null-p">"...Arimura."</p>
<p class="null-p">- a feeble voice, one that sounded like it was on the verge of vanishing alltogether, reached his ears and Suzuka appeared before him. She looked as if she was about to cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I'm sorry," she said, eyes welling with tears until she could no longer look at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know, you are really angry with me, Arimura... As expected... Even if I am to be ignored by you, I have no grounds to argue... Y-you can continue to keep ignoring me...but, I just...want to apologize to you for real. I said that I'll woo you this summer vacation, Arimura...because, if another girl confessed to you...I-I'd be really troubled... There are many other girls...who secretly like you, Arimura... And with this being our last summer in middle school...someone might summon the courage to, confess to you..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka looked a lot more feeble than usual. She dared not to look Riku in the eyes and she was stuttering.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So-so I announced this…to everyone…because I didn't want that, to happen... I wanted to message them, telling them that we're dating, because I wanted to warn off others... Tell them that you belong to me, Arimura. Bbecause, I always, always liked you, Arimura...I didn't want you to be taken by anyone else..."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka's voice got increasingly softer and more hoarse. When Riku turned his head to look at her, her head dropped even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the first time, Suzuka conveyed her unvarnished feelings to Riku. Enduring all the shame, she lowered her head and exposed her cowardice and deceitfulness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku could see her sincerity, and he felt pity for her. The emotional turmoil within him was slowly resolving itself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was not just Suzuka's own fault.</p>
<p class="null-p">She simply happened to really resemble Riku's mother and, for that reason, Riku had been biased against her from the start. He had expected her to surely be like his mother, flirtatious and flighty. Thus, he had kept rejecting Suzuka. Like her, Riku revealed himself to be a narrow-minded, ignorant person.</p>
<p class="null-p">"...I'm not angry with you anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Suzuka lifted her head, tears filling her eyes as she stared at Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku looked straight back at her. There was calm in his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For me, it's a painful thing to interact with others. I don't know what to say when others try to talk to me. There's just that sense of awkwardness in the heart, for me, for the person talking to me… My heart is most peaceful when I'm alone, drawing. When I'm drawing, I don't want to be disturbed. I'm such an irritating kind of guy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then... Can I stay by your side as long as I don't talk, Arimura?" asked Suzuka timidly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you keep standing by my side quietly, I'll be distracted by you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I wo-won't distract you then... I'll just be there, unnoticed. Okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are speaking already, that's not being unnoticeable, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku sounded aloof, but he answered as sincerely as possible. That made Suzuka regain her determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll try my best to remain quiet and hold my breath so that you won't feel annoyed, Arimura... I'll do my best to make sure that you won't notice my presence, that it's as transparent as air… So that you won't be irritated because of me, and forget me… But I'll definitely remain by your side, Arimura, so ‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">With her heads low, Suzuka murmured her last words barely louder than a buzz of a mosquito.</p>
<p class="null-p">"- so Arimura, if you feel lonely one day and need someone to talk, please call for me."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise was dressed in the handmade blue dress. Her long hair was let down under the straw hat with the white ribbon tied to it. She stood with a lowered head before the door to Riku's ground-level flat at the corner of the apartment block.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Andou-san told me that this is Riku-kun's house. I made up my mind to come here…but nobody's home...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Her arrival at another person's house was beyond shamelessness. It showed an utter lack of common sense too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely Riku would feel perturbed as well.</p>
<p class="null-p">But once her father sold the villa away, she would be unable to return to this village in the future. Truly, this was the last day she could meet Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Earlier in the morning, she had trembled with the newspaper in her hands, pleading with Andou-san to be told Riku's home address. While shocked, Andou-san had understood what was on the girl's mind. The old woman had that forlorn, yet gentle look to her then.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐So Chise-san, you weren't waiting for the newspapers, but for Riku-kun...</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise had promised Andou-san that she would return before the car arrived. Following the map the housekeeper had given her, she had arrived at the apartment where Riku lived with his mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">She just needed to say thanks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just that alone...</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise pressed the doorbell, but there was no answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">She shriveled and hid in the shadows behind the stairs for an hour.</p>
<p class="null-p">If anyone was to see her, she would surely be deemed suspicious and that would cause Riku trouble.</p>
<p class="null-p">This old apartment stood by the side of a graveyard. There were no pedestrians walking along the pavement in front of it. There was just that one kitten that hopped off from somewhere and landed nearby, startling Chise to a point of near-death.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sun was right above Chise's head. It was lunchtime.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Just an hour more... Maybe he'll be back for lunch...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise took her phone out to check the time, full of worry.</p>
<p class="null-p">An hour passed. Then two. She waited for another hour, but Riku did not return.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise wanted to cry, yet she could not shed any tears at this moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">(It is about time...to return.)</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time Riku left school, it was late afternoon, almost dusk.</p>
<p class="null-p">He told Suzuka that he had no intentions of getting close to anyone at this point, and likely never would have. The girl had left the classroom despondently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since then, he was looking at the sketchbook alone, looking at the illustration of the girl from the villa.</p>
<p class="null-p">He did not return to the apartment, going straight to the shop instead. He changed his clothes and got ready to deliver the newspapers.</p>
<p class="null-p">While riding on the bicycle -</p>
<p class="null-p">(Did that girl...return to Tokyo already?)</p>
<p class="null-p">- he thought of the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she was still at the cottage, Riku wanted to have a look at her for the last time.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so this feeling drove Riku to cycle to the cottage.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky gradually got paler and the sunset was about to come. Riku arrived at the red postbox of the old cottage and parked his bicycle.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no one at the courtyard, and the house looked especially quiet. Riku looked towards the window of the girl's room and found the grassy green curtains pulled down inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, her family had arrived to take her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku looked towards the window longingly, then bit his lips and pedaled off.</p>
<p class="null-p">By the time he was done delivering newspapers, a faint shade of pink started to tint the sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">The brook slowly moved on, and a trail of lush, green trees grew along the path. A tender orange light embraced him as he cycled on...</p>
<p class="null-p">(This was where I first met her... It was evening too...)</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart was aching.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right at this moment, a white ribbon appeared fluttering in the air, slowly gaining focus in Riku's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">That straw hat with the ribbon tied to it...</p>
<p class="null-p">Startled, Riku hurriedly hit the brakes. A long-haired girl ran out from behind the trees, chasing after a straw hat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything in his world was aflutter, the white ribbon, the delicate black hair of the girl chasing it, and the sky-blue dress that trailed behind her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku reached out to grab the straw hat that was flying by.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl from the cottage stared at him with surprised, wide eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku looked back at the girl's face and extended his arm out to hand over the straw hat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The white delicate hands timidly received the hat Riku retrieved. She then brought it to her chest, looking as if she had just witnessed a miracle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku harbored the same feelings, his eyes never leaving her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I met her... again...)</p>
<p class="null-p">The setting sun shone upon her face, hair, lips, and blue dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly, she bowed deeply, as politely as she did when receiving the newspaper from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">But her back was arched more than usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you...very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">She thanked gracefully but, to Riku's ears, the 'thank you' had an additional meaning to it and he felt a shiver in his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will be returning to Tokyo today. I really wanted to thank you... I thought I will never see you again… Thank goodness I got to meet you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She lifted her face, beaming, looking as though she would be vanishing imminently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's heart tightened all the more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why...are you, at such a place?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She thanked Riku, who in turn wanted to tell her something. The summer with her was so... impossible to describe. She saved him, and he drew a picture of her. However, he could not convey these thoughts into words, only into more doubts.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Before I go... I wanted to see the firefly swamp." "Fireflies...? But they appear during Tanabata. Now ‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl smiled, and nodded, interrupting him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I know there are no fireflies now, but I saw a photo at the exhibition at the department store, a swamp with lots of fireflies flying around. The title was 'The Cowherd and the Fairy'. I wanted to have a look at the place after seeing the picture... but I got lost... and did not get to see it. I should be heading back soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">'The Cowherd and the Fairy...' Riku was quietly startled by these words.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had once had a short conversation with the maiden-like granny at the marsh in the forest. He could still recall the words she muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐Especially during summer nights, when those who come here become fairies and cowherds.</p>
<p class="null-p">And the relative of that fairy, the girl, was here now, smiling, yet looking so forlorn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's go!" he shouted without even realizing what he was doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's right there, straight ahead of us. I'll bring you along. Hurry, get on the bicycle!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">Prompted by Riku, the girl sat on the back seat of the bicycle. With some hesitation, she grabbed onto the side of the back seat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This might get bumpy. Hold me tight!" said Riku adamantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl, in shock likely, also raised her voice and her slender arms wrapped firmly around Riku's waist.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that moment, Riku stepped on the pedals hard and the bike surged forth.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What am I doing? The shop owner told me not to approach the Princess!)</p>
<p class="null-p">But he felt his heart tighten at the thought that he could finally spend time with the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">He hoped for this moment to last longer, even if just a little bit. He wanted to bring her to that place.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bicycle bounced a few times on the unpaved dirt path. Whenever it did, the girl's face would lean upon his back. The parts of his body touching the girl slowly started to feel sizzling-hot, and that heat reached Riku's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart was beating loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sun gradually descended, forging a blazing red trail through the sky, and then, it was night.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the way to the swamp, an upbeat melody chimed from the girl's phone. Riku felt the girl gasp behind his back. However, she almost immediately yelled, "never mind that! Keep going! Please!" It was the first time he heard her sound so determined.</p>
<p class="null-p">He pedaled harder than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">The surrounding greenery got denser and he struggled to see in the dark. Going any farther on the bicycle was not possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Get off. We're almost there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku held the girl's hand, and they advanced through the grass.</p>
<p class="null-p">His big, sweaty palm held the delicate, little hand. Her palm was damp as well, and cold too, but she was holding on firmly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The vegetation got thicker. There was no light to be seen anywhere. The entire world seemed to consist only of him and the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their breathing was frantic, echoing through the pitch-black darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a short while, suddenly, they could see ahead of them again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The faint moonlight reflections were scattered on the vast surface of the swamp. The illusion of the wide-open skies seen intermittently through the forest canopy flickered rhythmically, soundlessly reflected on the water surface.</p>
<p class="null-p">‐‐This is the most beautiful place in the world.</p>
<p class="null-p">The genial voice of the fairy Riku had heard that day once again echoed in his ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl, still holding his hand, sighed softly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The stars... are floating on the surface... Like the fireflies."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's eyes too were dazzling like the stars, her cheeks and lips betraying delight.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, clear dew fell from her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moonlight shone upon her white, ethereal face. She shivered, and... a tear slowly trickled down her cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">This tear looked so beautiful to Riku, so sacred. New tears formed in response to that tear, as one by one, they slipped down the girl's cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">They flickered as they fell, one by one.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku stared at the girl, eyes wide.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess...I can cry when I am happy," he heard her mutter with a quivering voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was as though she had just learned about it.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she smiled cheerfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tears kept flowing, yet her heart was ever so blissful.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am really happy, to meet you Riku-kun... And to come to this place with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku-kun... The girl uttered his name so naturally.</p>
<p class="null-p">A burning feeling slowly rose up from the depths of Riku's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's elation was infectious, gently tugging at his heartstrings. Something warm was sprouting deep within his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's tears, soft voice, words, all awakened Riku's emotions.</p>
<p class="null-p">The crying girl looked towards Riku's face, her eyes slightly expanded, and then her smile bloomed even more beautiful than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I saw your smile, Riku-kun," she whispered happily.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Ah, so it's that simple.)</p>
<p class="null-p">The parched heart was gradually coming back to life, his dull vision regained clarity and color.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah... This is the first time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku savored the feeling rising up his heart as he stared at the girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the first time I smiled," he answered calmly.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/one-shot/illustrations/riku-and-chise_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">The stars were akin to fireflies, fluttering along the water surface. The moonlight shone upon the duo, and they held hands, smiling at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like the cowherd and the fairy, so innocent, so blissful...</p>
<p class="null-p">"How did you know my name?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My helper told me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl blushed immediately, averting her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She masked her embarrassment with a light cough. Riku smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In that case... tell me your name too."</p>
<p class="null-p">The clenched hands shook, and the girl lifted her head timidly, her face apprehensive,</p>
<p class="null-p">"My name is Chise."</p>
<p class="null-p">The kanji of her name turned into a thousand stars.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she launched the stars into Riku's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">A thousand stars she gave him, and they all scattered inside in a gentle haze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them stayed at this place for a short moment longer, until Chise's phone rang once again. She had to hurry back.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the path back to the cottage, Riku worked the pedals, while Chise sat behind him, grabbing him firmly. None of them said a word.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bicycle rode upon the cobbled path, jolting up and down. They were reluctant to talk, and they did not know what to say.</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them saw the summer swamp filled with stars and the moonlight. It was truly beautiful and more than by the loneliness of the impending farewell, they were mesmerized by its beauty.</p>
<p class="null-p">That special place was filled with summer magic. It got a girl to cry and made him smile. They were just happy, blissful.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku felt the girl's steady breath on his back. He continued to cycle down the path in darkness and could almost fool himself that this moment would last forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the villa was there, right before their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">He saw the red postbox, and a black, grand sedan parked by the fence. His searing body immediately cooled down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Farewell was inevitable...</p>
<p class="null-p">This fact was on clear display to Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I don't want to leave her!)</p>
<p class="null-p">(I still want to be with her!)</p>
<p class="null-p">(I still want to talk with her!)</p>
<p class="null-p">(Our feelings have just blossomed, right? Does it just end here, after I finally got to know her name?)</p>
<p class="null-p">He experienced intense pain he had never felt before. Sadness and anxiety struck at him over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stopped in front of the postbox with a shrill sound that echoed through the air. His collar was icy cold, for Chise had left his side. The slender arms wrapped around his waist until now, released their hold.</p>
<p class="null-p">He remained seated on the bicycle, his face tense. Chise's long hair swayed, the hem of her blue dress moving along as she smiled forlornly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hands brought the white ribbon straw hat to her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for seeing me off."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her voice sounded so fleeting, so gentle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I will never forget about this village, and about you, Riku-kun. Please take care of yourself."</p>
<p class="null-p">The steady eyes stared straight at him, unwaveringly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Goodbye."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then they narrowed in sadness.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past, Riku would deliver the newspaper into Chise's hands, bow, and hastily leave. They lived in different worlds, and he felt that he should not get too close to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">But on this day, Riku gripped the handles of his bicycle firmly and did not move an inch.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time, it was Chise who turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">Through gritted teeth, Riku watched her leave.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once she was about to reach the corridor, Riku yelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Chise! I'm... I'm drawing a picture of you! Once I'm done, please have a look at it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">A faint light was oozing out from the cottage, highlighting the girl. She who turned around with shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">He looked at her with earnestness and determination.</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku's request was too sudden. Chise had no idea Riku could draw.</p>
<p class="null-p">And he knew the cottage would be sold off, that Chise would not return to this village. He knew and was all the more despondent because of it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise appeared to be on the verge of tears. Surely, in her mind, she was thinking that it was impossible. They were middle schoolers and, no matter how fervent, there were times when prayers could not be fulfilled. But even so...</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a promise."</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise and Riku made a promise that could never possibly be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until the very end, she maintained that apprehensive, yet gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">And with Riku watching her go, Chise's delicate black hair swayed for the last time as she went towards the villa's front door.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue</p>
<p class="null-h2">Promise</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku-kun,</p>
<p class="null-p">On the way to school today, I saw petals of frost spreading on the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were glittering under the morning sun and looked really cute, so I knelt down and gazed at them for quite a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">Winter is coming.</p>
<p class="null-p">It has been four months since the summer vacation ended, when I bade farewell to you for the final time, Riku-kun. It is shocking how fast time has passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last week, Father's new wife gave birth to a child. My little brother, it seems.</p>
<p class="null-p">I have yet to meet him but I am sure he is cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">Three months ago I have started to live on my own. I am starting to get used to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I go to school, a helper cleans my room and prepares dinner, so I am living well.</p>
<p class="null-p">I make my own breakfast and lunchbox, however. The recipes printed in the newspapers have really helped me a lot. My repertoire has increased tremendously.</p>
<p class="null-p">How many letters have I written to you, Riku-kun?</p>
<p class="null-p">I am a high school student, but here I am, writing a letter I cannot post. One might think I am being childish.</p>
<p class="null-p">But whenever I write to you, Riku-kun, my heart feels warm and enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="null-p">All my letters to you are well hidden inside my favorite cookie jar. They are my treasures.</p>
<p class="null-p">I do take another look at them from time to time, and though my heart may ache, I do get that warm fuzzy feeling within. I do feel blessed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now I finally know why Shiori-san would keep her love diary from when she was sixteen years old at the bottom of her sewing box.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, she read it over and over again, and it made her happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Oh yes, yes. I believe someone took a photo of the firefly swamp you brought me to, Riku-kun. The caption beneath the picture, 'Cowherd and Fairy', was based on a novel. I finally managed to read it a few days ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">I started looking for it using the title 'Cowherd and Fairy', but I could not find it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The real title is 'A Midsummer's Night Dream'.</p>
<p class="null-p">The author is Kanoko Okamoto-san, a female writer active from the Taisho to the Showa period.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a princess called Toshiko-san in the story. She had a fiancé but ended up spending a wonderful few short days of summer with a friend of her older brother, a man called Masase-san. It is a short story, but the night the two spent together was so alluringly pretty, their relationship so pure, so warm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like the fairy and the cowherd, they spent the summer night together and went their separate ways.</p>
<p class="null-p">Toshiko-san's fiancé felt it was a wonderful memory and titled it 'a Midsummer Night's Dream' so that she could treasure it in her heart and occasionally share this intimacy with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her fiancé really was a nice man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, Toshiko-san would have a wonderful life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Shiori-san never got married, but since she had such a wonderful memory, I suppose she was happy regardless.</p>
<p class="null-p">She really liked that person and had to break up with him, but, despite that, she was still happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">What I received from your hands that summer was that special, Riku-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every morning, I looked forward to receiving your newspapers, Riku-kun.</p>
<p class="null-p">You brought me to the firefly swamp and I rode on the bicycle with you. You called me by my name. I treasure these memories dearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking at me with those determined eyes of yours, you said that you were going to finish the painting of me, and hoped that I would see it. I think I should not have made that promise back then.</p>
<p class="null-p">But if time were to be rewound back to that summer, to that farewell scene, I definitely would still have answered 'yes'.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though I now know this promise will never be fulfilled, I would still smile and answer 'yes'.</p>
<p class="null-p">This would be my answer, no matter how many times I were to be asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if the promise will never be fulfilled, I will not feel sad, nor will I feel disappointed.</p>
<p class="null-p">For that promise itself is the best memory you have left for me Riku-kun."</p>
<p class="null-h2">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="null-p">The seasons passed slowly.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the morning, Chise would always head down to the first floor of the apartment block, where the postboxes were located. Cold wind would sting her cheeks when she would open the door, and she would tremble.</p>
<p class="null-p">(If it is this cold, Riku-kun too will have difficulties delivering newspapers...)</p>
<p class="null-p">She was worried about him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely, it was snowing there during winter, no?</p>
<p class="null-p">If the snow cover got too thick and the roads could no longer be seen, could he ride on the bicycle safely? Or would he walk and deliver instead...?</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise took out the newspapers from the postbox, and gently embraced them, ostensibly to warm them before returning to her room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even after all this, she continued to read the newspapers.</p>
<p class="null-p">And she was on her second sticker book too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whenever she was sad or lonely, she would flip the sticker book. She would instantly feel a lot better, as though she was back reliving those dazzling summer days.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her father's new wife was just ten years older than Chise and since, as Chise had accidentally overheard her relatives discuss, she did not wish to meet her step-daughter, Chise's father had his daughter move out of the house.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise did not know when they would let her see her little brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had agreed to have a meal with her birth mother outside once, but it was cut short when someone called her mother, who then left Chise behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">-"I'm not opposed to you taking my family name. But right now, I am starting my new life, and I'll be too busy to spare time for you. And I definitely can't live together with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no concern for Chise in the tone of her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would never respond to any of Chise's letters or messages.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her classmates and her seniors at the tea ceremony club were worried for her when they heard about her parents' porce. Yuina especially looked guilty when she faced Chise at school.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't know your parents were facing such a situation, Chise-chan… Sorry for sending such a message carelessly," she said apologetically.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise pretended to not mind, cheerfully saying that she had already been prepared for it, and had been relieved to hear Yuina's news instead. Everyone was relieved to hear that and envious that she could live in an apartment alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise kept her smile up whenever she was in school.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she looked gloomy, everyone would be worried about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Back in her apartment, she would place the dinner that the hired help had prepared into the microwave. After dinner, she would do her assignments or read some books. This was how she spent her days.</p>
<p class="null-p">And during this time, she would be thinking about Riku.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thus, her heart felt very warm, even in this very cold morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">(How is the serialized novel developing? Did Saburou-san manage to get Wakako-san back after barging into her wedding?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise knew she really should prepare breakfast first, but she was really curious about the next events in the story, so she knelt on the carpet in the living room and opened the newspaper first.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I'll just have a peek... Hmm... The page number is...)</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise flipped through the dull, crude, thin pages, and suddenly, that thing appeared in front of her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Chise's hands held the edge of the page, her breath held as she remained still.</p>
<p class="null-p">She widened her eyes, staring in utter disbelief.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a large color picture printed on the page.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was filled with warm orange tones and showed a girl wearing a pure white straw hat that was standing by the edge of the brook next to a copse of trees. Her long black hair was flowing with the breeze, and she appeared about to turn her head away from the audience.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky blue dress wrapped around the slender body, and one could see a hint of a smile on the edge of the lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Black-framed glasses rested upon the bridge of the girl's nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hands were holding the frames in place, and she looked really cute.</p>
<p class="null-p">The painting was filled with vibrancy and warmth, the light of the sunset was gently flowing down the pure white ribbon and the dress...</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl's facial features looked very indistinct.</p>
<p class="null-p">But this...</p>
<p class="null-p">This painting was...</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a drawing contest organized by the publisher.</p>
<p class="null-p">And in the outstanding award section of the student category, the title of the winner was written as, "15-year-old ‐ 9th grader, Riku Arimura".</p>
<p class="null-p">When she saw the name, tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Riku-kun fulfilled our promise!)</p>
<p class="null-p">He drew a painting of Chise.</p>
<p class="null-p">The colors he used were so tender, so warm... and amidst the genial, beautiful scenery, he depicted Chise so adorably, so happily...</p>
<p class="null-p">He fulfilled the promise that could never be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="null-p">He showed Chise, who was so far away, such a beautiful painting.</p>
<p class="null-p">She lost herself in those days again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning sun that gradually rose above the hilltops, the cool breeze, the approaching bicycle, the sound of the tires, and the lingering warmth of the newspapers on her fingertips.</p>
<p class="null-p">With her heart racing, she watched the skinny, tanned face and the mature eyes. The bicycle slowly departed, and with a blissful heart, she watched the silhouette of that back depart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The day he first talked to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she was wearing only one contact lens, stumbled, and he embraced her carefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Finally, the night when both of them witnessed the swamp...</p>
<p class="null-p">The clusters of stars that filled the sky and reflected in the waters.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world belonging only to the fairy and the cowherd, the most beautiful of all secret places in the world...</p>
<p class="null-p">Riku, who always scowled before, finally beamed upon seeing the smile bloom on Chise's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">The treasured memories appeared one by one from the depths of her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">The tears Chise was shedding were like a warm rain landing on Riku's painting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Riku-kun...Riku-kun...th, thank you...Riku-kun, Thank you. Rikukun...Really, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was only gratitude on her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was so happy, so blessed...</p>
<p class="null-p">She was choking. Her heart was shaking.</p>
<p class="null-p">She could only cry in agony, whispering her thanks over and over again.</p>
<p class="null-p">The tear-stained picture was captioned 'First Love'.</p>

<p class="null-h2">The End.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">Hello, this is Mizuki Nomura. I drafted the plot of this work while writing 'Usa Koi'. Back then, the editor asked me, Do you want to try writing a heartbreaking love story? There was lots of planning from there. Back then, I asked a colleague at my part-time job about what kind of story I should write. His eyes sparkled and he got really fired up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to see a love story spanning the social strata, between a rich, sickly princess and a poor newspaper boy!" So I was told.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-newspaper boy...! And pr-princess...? A sickly one? In thi-this era..."</p>
<p class="null-p">This request was really unexpected, and so out of left field, that I timidly refused.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, while I was feeling really bored during my part-time work, I somehow happened to think about this topic again. A newspaper boy…probably a middle schooler. A high schooler would likely have better job opportunities. Personality-wise, a silent type…an introverted one for the girl … And why, despite having such different backgrounds, would they be so attracted to each other… As I kept thinking, Riku and Chise started to take shape. By the time I realized it, I had ten pages of notes.</p>
<p class="null-p">This story was supposed to be published as a short story after "Usa Koi", but my sales figures were a little low, and it was deemed too dull commercialwise, so the entire project was suspended at the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">I stuffed the plot and the notes into an orange envelope, on which I wrote in large words, "One day, I'll write you!". I stored this envelope into the closet with other unused ideas. After that, I tried my luck a few more times, only to be rejected again. This time, I finally got to write it once I found the time to do it. The entire process took quite a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">Having finally published this work, I felt that an assignment I had set aside for several years was finally complete.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, I had almost given up on publishing this story. I felt that one day, I would write the rest of it just to entertain myself, so some plot ideas or settings were used in the other works.</p>
<p class="null-p">The 'boy who can't smile' and the 'girl who can't cry' were used in 'Hikaru ga Chikyuu ni Itakoro…'; Shiori-san was used in 'Tsuki-hana o Daku Undine'; 'Midsummer's Night Dream' was used in the uncollected anthology of 'Bungaku Shoujo'. This story contains lots of overlapping themes with these works, and to me, it is an important starting point for them.</p>
<p class="null-p">I hope for many more people to read this story. I hope that everyone can be moved a bit by the Summer Story of Riku and Chise, and then imagine their futures.</p>
