<p class="null-h1">Prologue ‐ What Happened at That Day</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">The battle‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">The battle of this world's hero‐the battle as a hero had ended for the time being.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, as long as one lived as a human, the everyday life was also a battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then the conclusion of the battle that was the girls' love had only reached the climax from here on.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the tale of after story.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yochi yochi, you're really a good boy aren't you, Runo."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyah, kyah"</p>
<p class="null-p">The fortress city Cross Field at spring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi in her uniform was sitting on a sofa inside the drawing room of the royal officer academy. She was holding a silver haired baby while cuddling him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her posture was really natural with the sun gently shining from the window. She was displaying a scene of comforting daily life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Papa will also go home soon okay. So you must be a good kid."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Auu"</p>
<p class="null-p">The baby smiled when Airi talked to him with a kind voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before long the baby closed his eyes and fell asleep. Airi watched over him with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was truly a scene that depicted what small happiness meant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-err, Airi……say, that's"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct who was watching that from the crack of the door was trembling as soon as she entered inside the room while her face was staying blank.</p>
<p class="null-p">In contrast Airi's eyes widened and her body jerked stiffly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait!? Please don't startle me like that. You will wake the baby."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I was planning to knock but, my hand couldn't move from shock……. Since when did Airi have Lux-san's child‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct half averted her eyes so that she wouldn't meet Airi's eyes while replying.</p>
<p class="null-p">She acted like there was something that she shouldn't have seen in front of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yo ‐ u ‐ a ‐ re ‐ wro ‐ ng! Please don't get such strange misunderstanding! He is a survivor of the Arcadia family that Aeril-san discovered inside the Ruin of the new kingdom. I'm just looking after him temporarily until Aerilsan come to pick him up!"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut/illustrations/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut_vol_20_6.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"B-but, you mentioned something about papa just now"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's just a figure of speech! I was talking about a fictional father!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. ……Well, let's just say I believe you Airi."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you looking at me with a knowing look like that……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi retorted at what Noct muttered after she regained her composure. That voice made the baby woke up and he began to cry.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi panicked and lulled him to sleep once more. After that he entrusted the baby to the manager of the girl dormitory.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">On the sofa of the drawing room once more. "‐By the way, did you have a business with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi straightened her back and cleared her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct sat at her opposite with a table between them. Then she sipped the brewed tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are still in the middle of spring break right now. It's a holiday after so long."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes‐but the announcement will be soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed. Time really flies. We too will be second year soon."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was the final battle between Lux and Fugil at the beginning of the year. With that things were concluded for the time being‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even the fact that Queen Raffi had died had only been told to the majority of the students and the populace a few days ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">The work of pioneering the management of a new nation was going to begin from now on. Because of that Lux was swamped with work and he wasn't really able to attend the academy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi too was volunteering to do various works in order to support her big brother who was in such situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes, it was about the matter of Lux becoming the new king of the new kingdom.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was doing his studies in Cross Field while also doing the work as the king at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, in the end Lord Dist of the four great nobles was the one taking care of the domestic affairs. Lux was almost nothing more than the king in name only.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Lisha's position would be too weak with just herself alone, so she borrowed the name of Lux as the "hero" who had left behind numerous accomplishments.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, although Lux was only lending his fame, someone in the position of king would still be quite busy.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was the preliminary arrangement for announcing it to the people, attending the negotiation with other country and the nobles within the country. There were all sorts of work to be done.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then most importantly‐there was the "five wedding ceremonies" that would be held soon.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the old empire, there was the polygamy system that was limited only to the royalty and the nobles. And that system was still more or less continuing even after the country changed into the new kingdom.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, from the legal standpoint there wasn't any problem at all with such marriage but‐Lux was still feeling reluctant even then.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, everything changed with a single sentence from Krulcifer a month ago.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, about the talk of who is the one who has win Lux-kun's heart…"</p>
<p class="null-p">Three days after defeating Fugil at the Ancient Forest that served as the stage of the final battle. They had returned back to the royal castle in the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">The members of Syvalles had more or less finished resting or going through medical treatment. Then Krulcifer suddenly spoke at that time when all of them met together.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What are you saying so suddenly!? Right now isn't the time for that. There are a lot of works for sealing the Ruins and putting back the new kingdom back on its feet‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an unusual situation where the flustered Lisha was the one who took the role of keeping the situation under control. But Krulcifer walked toward Lux while that was going on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying this exactly because it's this time. It's exactly because the time right now will be the most important than never before and even in the future‐. Lux-kun also think so, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Krulcifer didn't back off.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis, the Triad, and Airi who were also in attendance‐even they were listening with a shocked expression at the opinion of the usually composed girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only Yoruka and Philuffy were observing the how things were proceeding with their usual attitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Errr……. You're, right. I have to, decide about that matter too."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux also nodded after a short pause.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was still hesitating. The tone of his voice was containing some awkwardness.</p>
<p class="null-p">A while ago the girls had formed a"pact" that forbid confession toward Lux until the battle was over.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then due to Uroboros's Divine Raiment‐Endless, the three days of parade got looped many times. Lux ended up getting together with four girls during those three days loops.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls in this place had recalled and remembered those loops.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi and the Triad were also learning that fact from hearing the story.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, I understand. But, please give me just one day. I need time to consider who to choose‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux took a deep breath and then he gave that reply. But Krulcifer brought her face close to him and she whispered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux-kun, there is no need for that. No, rather‐we won't allow you to do something like choosing someone from among us. If you say that you're going to become the king‐then accept all of us."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux and the other girls were bewildered. Krulcifer gave them a certain suggestion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course if I'm allowed to be frank‐I myself want you to look only at me alone but, at this point I can't say something like that anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer casted her eyes downward while forming her words seriously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Besides Lux-kun, if you said that you had chosen someone else in that parade, then I could give up even if it is really painful. But‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was the choice of none other than Lux himself, she would go along with it even while swallowing her tears.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, in reality there was a possibility of Lux getting together with all of them if not because of the memory alteration by the parade's looping.</p>
<p class="null-p">No, the reality where her love came to fruition and both of them got together existed.</p>
<p class="null-p">That reality was simply treated like it had never happened before this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If, you don't choose me after this. Even though at that time, the two of us really got together with each other‐. Even though I should be able to be together with you. I won't be able to endure myself if I have to live while harboring such thinking."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Krulcifer-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Hearing Krulcifer's heart-rending feeling, it wasn't just Lux, everyone there fell silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that parade, Lux confessed or got confessed to and became together with the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">From there they knew that a happy future for them had been realized. It was exactly because of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because they recalled such memory that they couldn't endure it.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the same time it made Lux responsible.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although their memories were altered at that time, he made the choice to get together with everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a long silence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone there racked their brain and worried, and then finally Lisha sighed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. I'm also reluctant to do this but, I'll lend Lux to everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lisha-sama!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no other choice than that right? Otherwise everyone's relationship will be frayed no matter who you choose. I'm confident that you will choose me but, that stupid world alteration has made everything complicated, so it can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">She showed a magnanimity that was befitting a princess but,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you acting so condescending? You're acting like the legal wife even though Lux-kun didn't choose you during the parade."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa!? Without me endorsing Lux to be king, he also wouldn't be able to marry anybody else in his position! So I'm obviously the legal wife isn't it!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that Lisha and Krulcifer began to quarrel. Airi watched them in exasperation and shrugged.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san. Please do something about them quickly. The new dynasty is in the risk of breaking up even before its formation thanks to Nii-san's womanizing habit. Please do your duty as the next king."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's my first duty as the king!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She was speaking jokingly but, Airi too didn't raise any objection about Lux becoming the king.</p>
<p class="null-p">Originally she would want to object to the situation where her brother was dragged into troubles but‐she had also noticed that they weren't in that kind of stage anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most of all, she understood that this was for the sake of Lux himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi. You have really matured."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct suddenly smiled at her from the seat beside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't say something incomprehensible like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. My apologies. Then let's think one by one, about what are we going to do from here on."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then they began talking about the specific of things.</p>
<p class="null-p">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I was slightly surprised by that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct spoke monotonely. Beside her Airi was making a blank stare at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What I felt at that time wasn't at the level of mere surprise. Just what are they thinking about other person's big brother……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I know that Airi must be dissatisfied with how much you love Lux-san but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's unrelated. I'm just speaking with common sense. That's, Nii-san serving as king for one year while marrying five people at the same time even though he is still just a student‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer's suggestion was for Lux to become the king of the new kingdom and married Lisha, Krulcifer, Celis, Philuffy, and Yoruka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, everyone in that place was shocked and the place fell into chaos but‐in the end that idea was told to Lord Dist and it was decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls were also in agreement, so the five marriages would really be carried out.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Episode 1 ‐ Lovey Dovey With the Academy's Strongest (Celis Chapter)</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">After that‐, it was decided that Lux would accompany the girls who would become his queens to the place that had significant meaning for them, one by one in turn, with the marriage ceremony with Lisha at the capital as the last one in turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">In short it was Lux's official tour as king.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux who had stopped being an imperial prince of the old empire experienced what kind of job being a king was for the first time with this.</p>
<p class="null-p">First he had to solidify his base within the new kingdom.</p>
<p class="null-p">He departed to the western territory that was being governed by Dist of the four great nobles together with Celis who was now his fiancée.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to shorten the travel time through long distance, they used Drag-Ride until a short distance before entering the castle town. It had also been decided that the members going there would only be Lux and Celis, and the Triad as their bodyguard.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux thought that they didn't really need bodyguard now that the major battle had been completed.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Sharis of the Triad admonished him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand that you must wish to be alone with Celis, but you are being too much of a peace idiot right now, Lux-kun. In a glance it looks like that all troubles have been solved, but it's at this kind of time that a mistake might occur. We don't know what the people who had been hiding in shadow until now might do. We have to be on our guard exactly for that kind of situation."</p>
<p class="null-p">The argument of Sharis who was the daughter of the military's deputy commander was correct.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a glance, there was no disturbing elements that could be seen within the new kingdom right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, as long as human still lived with other human‐as long as there was the existence of nation, letting one's guard down was a taboo for a royalty.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps Lux was unconsciously letting his guard down thoughtlessly because his body had been strengthened from Baptism and he possessed powerful Divine Drag-Ride as his weapon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. Then, it might be a burden for you three but, can I ask you to come as our bodyguards?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Of course. We're gonna come along even if you don't wanna us to."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. As you command, your majesty."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux requested for the Triad's help once more. Tillfur responded cheerfully while Noct agreed courteously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly seeeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to act that respectful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, we should be acting respectfully from here on. You‐no, your majesty too will also do the work of king at the same time of being a student, so we should pay attention to appearance."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis smiled with a serious gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely she was in the right about this argument.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis who was beside him also nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, indeed. Lux, from now on it seems we will have to act rigidly when in public."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Right, it can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled while saying that with a lonely look. Even so he straightened his back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let me rephrase my order. Triad, I command the three of you to accompany our trip as bodyguard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes-"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three bowed and replied simultaneously‐, however Sharis smiled at the next moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, you can act like usual with us when we aren't in public you know, Luxkun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, cheater. Even though you specially told me to do all this tiresome act!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur lost her temper seeing Shari smiling casually like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct was watching that exchange with her usual blank stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a troublesome bunch."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">The Triad too was aware that Lux honestly didn't wish for such stiff masterservant relationship‐or something like the position of king.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though that was a type of naivety, it wouldn't be a problem if they properly knew the right time and place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt happy to have friends with such relationship while they were departing toward the west.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">They flew through the long distance with Drag-Ride in the blink of eye, and then they rode the horse carriage that Lord Dist had prepared from the castle town.</p>
<p class="null-p">They immediately observed the castle town not long after arriving to the castle.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed the town was in a welcoming mood toward the visit of the hero Lux. Lux waved his hand from inside the carriage toward the citizens who he saw were welcoming him with cheers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before long they returned to the small castle of the feudal lord Dist once more. The servants within the ground were all showing up to welcome him, but it seemed that the number of the servants was fewer than to be expected from the residence of one of the four great nobles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, guests were coming one after another when a banquet was started at the great hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">The nobles who possessed territory at the western part of the country along with their family, the countryside nobles from the neighboring country, the mayors and village chiefs from the neighboring towns and villages, there was no end to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis was wearing a beautiful light green dress. Lux was accompanying her while also wearing a dress suit to deal with the noble guests.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How are you feeling. Are you tired?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Dist would become Lux's father-in-law in the future seeing that he was betrothed to Celis. He led Lux outside when there was a break in the party and talked to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">They used a drawing room for a place to rest and sipped some tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">During this time Celis was taking Dist's place to act as the lord of the castle and dealing with the guests.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I have only began my duty as the king after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Lux pretended to be alright like that, he was also slightly troubled about doing something he wasn't to like dealing with the nobles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps it was the academy in Cross Field that was special, but doing chores in the girl dormitory was far more comfortable because he didn't need to pay so much consideration.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps‐his peaceful daily life in the academy was also thanks to Airi habitually making the necessary arrangements and the tactfulness of the Triad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, this was the path that Lux chose himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was still too early to whine.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought that and took a deep breath. Then Dist suddenly smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are‐strong huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">His tone sounded impressed from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. Lord Dist is especially helping me completely with the political matter……besides"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You know, I almost felt disheartened as a human. No‐perhaps I should say that I was unable to do anything."</p>
<p class="null-p">Dist stared at empty air while interrupting Lux's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the past had gone by.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dist looked like he was thinking about a scene that didn't exist at the present time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You might have heard from my daughter but, due to the custom of male chauvinism in the era of the old empire, my wife who was unable to give birth to a male heir had low status. However her body was also weak, so it was also impossible for her to give birth to more child."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the monologue of Dist who was toyed by his responsibility and position even with the great authority that he possessed as a great noble.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or perhaps it was exactly because of his great authority that he was put into such situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Exactly because he was in a position with power that people who tried to dig up any weakness no matter how slight and took advantage of it kept appearing. Such people existed even among relatives and friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">The surrounding nobles‐perhaps even relatives were pointing out the weakness that Dist's wife couldn't give birth to a boy and all of them recommended to him to take someone they knew as his concubine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I didn't like it. I also didn't feel like loving another woman than my wife but, even more than that it was because I understood that if I took a concubine who gave birth to a boy, my family would become warped."</p>
<p class="null-p">He could see that doing that would make his sickly wife lost her standing even more and she would become cornered further.</p>
<p class="null-p">Dist acquired the discernment and ability to be a good feudal lord and continued to refuse taking a concubine but‐he was unable to improve the situation of his wife who continued to receive slanders and her bad standing.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Dist's wife‐Ilshe walked the life of an outcast who tried to avoid the eyes of her relatives.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After that the empire crumbled and the new kingdom was established‐the tide at the surface changed. But, people's perception cannot be easily changed. The trend to put importance to male still remained. I don't want you to become a powerless man like me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely he never confessed these words to other people, or even to his daughter Celis. This was his farewell gift to Lux who was going to walk his path after this.</p>
<p class="null-p">A lot of hardships were waiting for the new kingdom and for Lux who was going to take five wives.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Lux and the other five didn't have any such intention , their surrounding wouldn't just leave them alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so don't lose‐Lux too Dist's words as an encouragement to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. But, please allow me to give a single correction."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I only heard from other people's story but, I think Lord Dist‐wasn't powerless at all. Even if things didn't go like you want them to, I think you manage to protect the heart of your wife."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why, do you think so?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because someone can be saved if only there is someone who love them from their heart, if there is someone who think of them earnestly even if it's just one person. That's what I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">Dist was speechless for a while at Lux's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before long he let out a small sigh and slowly stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Surely there won't be any problem if you treat my daughter like that. You should rest for a bit right now. I'll return to the great hall."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm coming too. I want to stay at Celis-senpa-……no, at Celis's side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like there was relieve and at the same time a tinge of loneliness in Dist's expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt his feeling as a father who was sending out his daughter while returning to the banquet at the great hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">From here on Lux would be the king publicly, but practically it would be Dist who managed the government in the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Lux headed to help Celis who was being surrounded by nobles in order to accomplish his duty to the best of his ability.</p>
<p class="null-p">The night banquet continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fundamentally Lux had accomplished many achievements that qualified him to be called a hero and he would also become the next king. Celis was only receiving praises as someone who was staying at Lux's side as his aide, but there were also nobles who were making various probes to obtain deep connection with them this early.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such noble were showing cooperative attitude at the surface while nonchalantly coaxing for compensation in exchange for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="null-p">For example‐, people who asked for Drag-Rides to be diverted their way.</p>
<p class="null-p">People who spoke their wish for their knight order to be welcomed as the kingdom's regular army.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were also people who asked for their convenience to be accommodated in a more blatant way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Depending on the situation Lux had to refuse them firmly or giving them the slip skillfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were also talking about political problems.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a long night for Lux. The night grew late and they saw off the guests before he became alone with Celis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for your hard work today, Celis-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'm fine. I can still keep drinking."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly seeing Celis clenching her fist with a red face.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wasn't strong with alcohol, but this time she was forcing herself to drink because she had a leading part in the banquet.</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't look like she would go into a drunken frenzy, but her reasoning power had completely dissolved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine already, so please rest for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally it was the servants' job to tidy up the banquet. Lux and Celis left them to it and withdrew.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a mansion within the ground of this small castle. Lux heard that place was used as the guest room for them this time, so she lent Celis his shoulder and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt the full weight of Celis's body because she was completely relaxed. And then there was the softness of her body that was becoming warm from the alcohol she imbibed. Lux's heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Come to think of it, the place for Lux to sleep had been specified, but he wasn't told about where Celis would sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Could it be‐no, there would be no problem if there was two beds.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, even if by some chance a mistake occurred, they were already betrothed with each other. There wouldn't be any problem‐such fact was heating up Lux's head even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Calm down, Celis-senpai is tired. Or rather, I'm also tired……)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux took a deep breath and headed to the mansion where he would sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis who was borrowing his shoulder seemed to breath slightly roughly, but she was clearly conscious.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was just one security guard watching outside the mansion. The inside was dark.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he opened the door and entered inside the room, there was a woman waiting inside the drawing room that was illuminated by the lamp's light. She was wearing an expensive looking loungewear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? Good evening."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was surprised because he thought that there was no one inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">The beautiful woman with graceful bearing seemed to be quite old, but she was overflowing with youthful charm that didn't make her seem so.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐the woman's blonde hair and blue eyes seemed somewhat similar with Celis.</p>
<p class="null-p">The absentminded Celis quickly let go of Lux's shoulder and straightened her posture.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her legs staggered because she was drunk, but she somehow kept herself from falling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work today. Were you able to fulfill your duty without any problem?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yes! Okaa-sama yourself, are you feeling alright right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had heard about her before, but this was his first time meeting Celis's mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was sickly and most of the time she was in recuperation after giving birth to Celis. She also didn't show herself in the banquet today because of that, so he completely thought that she wasn't feeling well.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis seemed flustered. Perhaps it was because she never expected to meet her mother here, or perhaps because she was seen leaning on Lux in a drunken state.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was showing a side of her as a fine and splendid senior in front of her father Dist, but she was showing another side of her toward her mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to force yourself. Besides‐I'm only going to talk a little here."</p>
<p class="null-p">The beautiful woman said that with a gentle smile before she turned toward Lux once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am Celis's mother, Ilshe Ralgris. Please take care of my daughter."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no, I should be the one saying that. Celis-sen‐your daughter has taken a very good care of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux quickly returned a bow when Ilshe courteously bowed to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux urged Ilshe to sit on the sofa, but the shook her head a little.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No need to be considerate of me. I don't come here to get in the way of the two of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's‐. I too wish to give my greeting to you properly madam."</p>
<p class="null-p">After Lux said that, Ilshe smiled softly at Lux and Celis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are Lux Arcadia-dono aren't you? I have heard the rumors about you since a long time ago, but it seems you are a man who is exactly like the rumor said."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux wondered which part of his fame that actually got conveyed to Celis's mother.</p>
<p class="null-p">He got a bit nervous while wondering that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that you are reliable, straightforward, and a kind boy. I was relieved when I saw my daughter leaning on your shoulder."</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-that was, my unworthiness! Usually I wouldn't do something like‐" Celis was flustered while waving her hands in front of her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Ilshe smiled wryly while shaking her head. She stared at Celis with a kind gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's alright. That's‐the proof that you have found a man who you can trust and you're your heart to after all. The you in the past wouldn't show such weakness in front of other people no matter how tired you are. All for my sake."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Okaa-sama……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I noticed you know? Even though I'm like this, I'm still your mother after all‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ilshe looked down and spoke with an earnest tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You worried about my standing and worked twice as hard as other people without saying a single complain in order to become a full-fledged knight.</p>
<p class="null-p">You would never act disheartened both in front of your father or in front of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis looked down and fell silent at her mother's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have hit the mark.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux too had heard about the situation of Celis's family.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ilshe was the legal wife of a great noble. She married into a noted noble family, and yet she was unable to give birth to a male heir.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that her relatives and her surrounding were looking at her with scorns and talked behind her back.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to dispel such talks, Celis tried to become even stronger and more splendid than any man.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had continued to show herself like that so that she wouldn't worry her mother or making her thinking that she was forcing herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was unable to whine or act spoiled in front other people that she was talking to even cat or doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">But it seemed her mother had seen through her bluff.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are my pride. You have saved your mother enough. That's why‐please live from here on for your own happiness. Please fight for your own sake and your loved one."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux and Celis couldn't say anything back in front of her warm voice that was filled with affection.</p>
<p class="null-p">They shouldn't show any affirmation or denial toward those words. They should simply accept them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, excuse me. If possible, I wish to see the face of my grandson soon. That will be my greatest happiness as a mother."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ilshe said that with a meaningful smile before she got out of this detached mansion.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely she was heading toward her husband‐Lord Dist who loved her more than anybody else.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was accompanied by the maid who was standing by outside and returned to the castle.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's rest for a little bit at the living room……"</p>
<p class="null-p">After seeing off Ilshe, Lux and Celis took a small break in the living room with just the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">A cheese cake that Ilshe baked for them was placed on the table in the living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……. As expected I was drunk. ‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis staggered when she let go of her tension and her body pitched forward.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux who was at her side hurriedly caught her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux put his strength into his arms and lifted her up into his embrace.</p>
<p class="null-p">The distance between the two was shortened once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux……. That's, thank you, very much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't force yourself, Celis-senpai. Take some rest. I'll make tea for you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux brought Celis's body until the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tense mind must have loosened up after safely dealing with the noble guests.</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides‐although they had taken some rest, both of them still had some fatigue left in their body from the intense battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just as Ilshe said just now, Celis who usually never showed her weakness might have been enduring it inside her all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis leaned on the sofa and stared at Lux with a heated gaze while still looking drunk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come to think of it Celis-senpai. Is there something that you want to do tomorrow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……what do you mean by that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis's eyes turned round in a daze. Lux spoke to her smilingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I want to express my thanks to Celis-senpai who has done your best. But if there is nothing you want to do then‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis fell silent for a few seconds after hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Then, can I make a request?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She asked that timidly with a hesitating tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Lux nodding, Celis firmed her resolve and told him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's, will you allow me to act spoiled? I don't mind if it's just for tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl averted her gaze from Lux and her face reddened. It looked like she found it hard to speak.</p>
<p class="null-p">In contrast Lux was looking puzzled because he couldn't understand what she meant right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, thinking really carefully, I don't really have any memory of acting spoiled toward someone ever since I became aware of my surrounding……. But, I can act the most at ease only when I'm together with Lux. That's</p>
<p class="null-p">why‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Her tone sounded like what she was asking for was a sin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely since Celis first became aware of her surrounding at her childhood‐in her memory that she remembered she had really never acted spoiled toward someone.</p>
<p class="null-p">At first, it was for the sake of her mother who couldn't give birth to a boy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then after a while, it was for the sake of Lux's grandfather who was her teacher.</p>
<p class="null-p">She imposed the duty to become stronger and more righteous than anyone while persistently accumulating her effort.</p>
<p class="null-p">That seriousness brought her the title as the academy's strongest, but she too had a girlish side in her of a girl at that age.</p>
<p class="null-p">However because she was cornering herself by saying that she wasn't allowed to act spoiled in her position, she was unable to say her true feeling to anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why she was airing her complaints to cat and bird, or even plants or doll.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just like when he first met Celis in the academy‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to try acting spoiled to someone reliable."</p>
<p class="null-p">As time passed and her standing become even bigger, that dream gradually becoming even more impossible to realize.</p>
<p class="null-p">Acting spoiled was like candy. It would be bad for the body if it was eaten excessively every day.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐it wouldn't be any problem to do that sometimes for someone like Celis who worked several times harder than other people and fought for her responsibility.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore, Lux felt happy that Celis who never tried to act spoiled even once until now due to her own will was opening up to him, even if it was because she was drunk.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who wasn't good with acting spoiled more than anybody else was asking something like that to a man like him. It was the proof of her giving him her utmost trust.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, if Celis-senpai is alright with me, I'll happily do so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled to Celis with a bright and composed voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say that it's just for tonight. Please act spoiled to me anytime you like."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The eyes of Celis who was making a red face were sparkling like shining stars.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the next moment, Celis leaned heavily on the sofa as though all the tension had left her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the time that he looked forward to the most in this inspection tour.</p>
<p class="null-p">A sweet moment with Celis in her dress was going to start.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">Soft orange light spilled out from the chandelier on the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were alone with each other at this time with the crackling sound of fire from the fireplace in front of the sofa accompanying them.</p>
<p class="null-p">The atmosphere was pleasant and peaceful for their body that was moderately drunk from alcohol. At the same time there was a bittersweet sensation too that was making their heart pounding inside their chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was preparing to brew tea beside the sofa where Celis was resting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis was watching that lovingly with reddened cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Celis-senpai‐no. Celis, you should relax there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis had asked Lux just now to talk like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally Lux was using polite language when talking with her because he was younger and her junior in the academy, but that made it hard for her to act spoiled, so Celis asked him to interact with her as though she was the same age with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, as someone older it would be hard for Celis to act spoiled if he constantly acted in the position of the younger one.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Besides‐you and me already lover who are engaged with each other."</p>
<p class="null-p">After she said that to him with an embarassed look, Lux became aware of their current relationship regardless of what he thought. His heart was pounding hard.</p>
<p class="null-p">He searched for a blanket while waiting for the water to boil. Then he put it over Celis's shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing the necessary arrangements, Lux first gave her some words of appreciation for the trip this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you for your hard work today. It was difficult to keep the guests in the party company wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes, it was hard. It was an unfamiliar work for me, so I needed to focus even more than in battle."</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis closed her eyes with a red face that was still drunk. Then she snuggled on him like a cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">He gently caressed her hair to soothe her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis kept her eyes closed with a comforted look. She entrusted her body weight on Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You really helped me a lot there. Thank you for working so hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis let out a relieved sigh when Lux whispered that gently into her ears while continuing his caress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad……. I'm glad that I can help you Lux. I'm‐happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis muttered with a tone that was half in a dreamy state perhaps because she was drunk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux, you're really kind. I love you. I want to be like this forever……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis rubbed her face and body on Lux while snuggling even closer. She muttered those words with a happy expression. Lux's heart skipped a beat from that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Normally she was an older girl who always acted gallant and aloof. That was exactly why she looked extremely adorable when acting like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis must be unaware of it but, by snuggling close like this, her sweet scent, her warmth from across the dress, and her voluptuous breast that was pressed on him melted Lux's reasoning.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Th-this is bad……. When Celis-senpai is being this defenseless‐. The destructive power is too powerful……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux took a deep breath. He almost lost his senses just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux somehow avoided going wild and gently comforted the dead drunk Celis. And then he brought the cake and tea to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Celis, I have made the tea. Do you think you can eat Ilshe-san's cake by yourself?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel, a bit tipsy. I'm not confident I can."</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis's body swayed unsteadily while she slightly opened her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She happily leaned on Lux once more when he sat beside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want you Lux, to feed me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-is it, no good……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis's gesture when she sent him an upward gaze when she was taller than him flustered Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had a slight embarrassment in him but, he was alone with Celis right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err……. Yes, say aaah"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut/illustrations/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut_vol_20_7.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Lux stabbed a piece of the cake that was put on a small plate and brought it to Celis's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Celis slightly opened her moth and presented her lips like a baby chick that was pleading for food.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could see her bewitching light pink lips from so close.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux slowly held out the fork. He stared at Celis who took the cake with her tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">After chewing and eating it, the girl leaked out a sweet sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's sweet, and delicious‐the cake. Having Lux spoon feeding me……is great."</p>
<p class="null-p">She whispered with a voice that was vaguely enraptured. It felt like Lux's brain would also melt.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that they continued until the cake was gone. Lux also blew at the hot tea to cool it down by Celis's request before helping her drank it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just doing that was taking a lot of time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everything that happened since they first met until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">What would happen from here on.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were many memories that they could talk about, but there was no need for words.</p>
<p class="null-p">After enjoying the time that was passing peacefully, Lux carried Celis in his arms and headed to the bedroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">He laid her down on the bed that had brand new sheet. Then Celis continued with her coaxing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Then, perhaps I should ask Lux to massage me next? Fua……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis who had completely entered her spoiled mode yawned slightly while making her request.</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-a massage?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux who was already highly excited was flustered by that word.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, wasn't this bad?</p>
<p class="null-p">It made sense to give massage to relieve Celis from her fatigue, but Lux was also a man.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now he was alone with Celis who was his lover and fiancée. He felt worried whether he could keep himself from making any mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">(No, there is no mistake or anything that can be made……isn't it? Because, Celis-senpai and me, are already‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them were in love with each other and had made a promise for the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">There wouldn't be anything strange even if they sought each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather it would be hard to flirt with Celis openly in the academy until she graduated. When he considered that, it could be said that doing such thing here would be the correct move.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Wait, don't tell me this mansion, is for that‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux noticed too late that the people around them had prepared a room for just the two of them, but Celis herself most likely was unaware.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then‐he couldn't possibly betray Celis here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You won't, give me a massage……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux resolved himself after seeing Celis's upward gaze that looked lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understa……. I get it Celis, then, can you lie face down for me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux calmed down his expectation that was inflating excessively and placed his hands on Celis's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">But just from opening the back of her dress and seeing her smooth skin instantly made Lux's reasoning to stagger.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh? What's wrong……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-, no-……! It's nothing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis who was lying face down tilted her head and looked back. Lux returned to his senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be, you can't massage me because of the dress?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, just for a little bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux spoke that he was troubled in the sense that "he was troubled of where to look".</p>
<p class="null-p">But Celis seemed to make some kind of misunderstanding. She lifted her upper body and extended both her arms suddenly to begin undressing herself. "Wait……!? Celis!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was greatly panicked by what suddenly happened and turned his back on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sound of rustling clothes stopped. Lux timidly turned around and found Celis lying down on her stomach just like before.</p>
<p class="null-p">A blanket was placed to cover her lower body from her waist below.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore, she was still wearing her long gloves perhaps because she found it tiresome to take them off while being drunk like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Calm down……, right now Celis-senpai isn't aware about what she is doing.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's exactly at time like this that I should be gentlemanly‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">The mind of Lux himself was getting chaotic. He put his hand on Celis's naked back in a daze like a sleepwalker as Celis urged him to.</p>
<p class="null-p">He gently placed his palms on the area around her shoulder blades and slowly began to put strength into his ten fingers.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nnh……. Haaaa……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The texture of the lustrous and tight skin was pleasant.</p>
<p class="null-p">It possessed the elasticity from her training but also the softness of flesh that clearly showed she was a woman at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely her voluptuous chest was being pressed flat on the bed because she was lying down on her stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Wait, just what am I imagining……! Calm down……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Even his deep breath for calming himself down made him inhaled the faint scent that was rising from Celis and making him even more conscious of her.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart was beating really loudly. Even so he controlled himself with a will of steel.</p>
<p class="null-p">From her shoulders to her whole back, her upper arms, her waist, the skill that he cultivated during his time as the chore prince was unraveling Celis's tense flesh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your hands Lux……feels really good. It's fine, to go stronger you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux lightly put his body weight into his hands and massaged Celis's body with effort.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each time he massaged, a feeling of enhancement that couldn't be described was burning within Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a sense, Lux was being forced to painfully endure even more than any fight he had been in until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">After such time that was like both heaven and hell passed, he realized that Celis had fallen asleep while lying on her stomach.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa……. I'm tired."</p>
<p class="null-p">He was tired mentally rather than physically.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Lux noticed something terrifying when he almost felt relieved because things were finally over.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, please don't fall asleep with that appearance-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's tone returned to his usual tone while calling out to Celis spontaneously.</p>
<p class="null-p">He immediately put a blanket on Celis, but she would catch cold if she only slept with that in this bedroom that didn't have a fireplace.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I have to wake her up at least once to make her wear pajama properly‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux thought that and searched for sleep-wear for Celis to change into.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body would get cold if he took too much time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, Lux resolved himself and lifted up Celis's upper body, but then Lux got hugged instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's thought stopped from the naked embrace that was separated from him only by a single blanket.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis's eyes faintly opened and she rubbed her sleepy eyes on his arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Munya……. Lux, My last request for tonight. Will you, listen to it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Err, Celis-senpai. You need to change your clothes first‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Thump thump* His heart was pounding like hammer in his chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other hand, he was also feeling a bittersweet heartthrob that made him wanted to stay like this forever.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Celis's arms wouldn't let go.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather she hugged him even stronger with a strong feeling in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her soft breast was pressed flat on Lux's chest. He was forgetting himself from that sensation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after that, Celis slowly stopped her embrace and smiled in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That time of the parade that vanished in the depth of my memory……that time when you confessed to me, I can't forget it. And the kiss that we did after that too. It's a happy memory that is like a dream, but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis said that with a drunken voice. Her tone was vacant. Then she smiled with her face reddening even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm scared because the world revision was carried out after that. I wonder if Lux's feeling at that time has also vanished together with the erased</p>
<p class="null-p">memory……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Celis, senpai……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, I want to hear it one more time. I want to reproduce that scene one more time. I want you to tell the current me, so that I won't forget, this time for sure……. Is it, no good?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis lightly averted her eyes and timidly requested him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux noticed.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was her last request, and the one that she wished to do the most. "‐‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">He actually should have been getting together with her during those three days of parade in the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because that memory was made to not exist due to the world revision, Celis felt anxious even after she recalled that memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">For her, it was a memory that was more important than anything, but it had become something unclear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes, her voice, and her sorrowfully swaying figure were telling him that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Celis, senpai‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">A strong, noble, diligent, and awkward older girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt blessed that she was harboring a feeling that strong toward him.</p>
<p class="null-p">His chest felt tight just from htat. The passion of that day welled up inside him.</p>
<p class="null-p">From there he stopped hesitating to touch her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I‐like you. I love you, Celis-senpai."</p>
<p class="null-p">He told her that and gently kissed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sweet and melting sensation from where their lips met filled his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">After sharing such time that lasted only for several seconds or perhaps a minute even though it felt like it was lasting forever, Celis pressed her lips on him once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Chuu*, she placed her lips on Lux's lips, wishing for even deeper exchange between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">The taste of alcohol and the tea and cake just now still remained deep inside Celis's tongue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis, senpai……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Lux, please, kiss me more. I have been, holding myself back all this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis who was drunk in various sense and not just from alcohol was approaching Lux unusually proactively.</p>
<p class="null-p">Once more they kissed repeatedly many times. They were forgetting how many times and how long they were doing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">From there they forgot to even sleep until dawn came and spent a long night.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your majesty."</p>
<p class="null-p">The dazzling morning sunlight shined in. Someone was shaking the body of Lux who had just fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your majesty‐no, Lux-san. Please wake up, it will be noon soon. You have to give a greeting any time now before returning to the academy, if not our schedule will go off course."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The voice was dispassionate and monotone‐however it passed through the ears clearly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux thinly opened his eyes and the figure of Noct in her uniform entered his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was looking down at Lux who was lying down on the bed with her usual blank stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Noct!? Why are you here!? More importantly‐uwah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Lux raised his upper body, he found the naked Celis wrapped in blanket beside him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux hurriedly covered her with blanket to hide the situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hands of the clock showed that it was already time for breakfast.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed he overslept and almost went over the schedule, so Noct who was one of his attendants right now came to check on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">E-err……if possible knock before you enter"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I had knocked ten times before coming in."</p>
<p class="null-p">A color of exasperation could be seen slightly within her expressionless face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You will get tired if you sleep like that you know? By the way, do you still have stamina remaining to pilot Drag-Ride?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, I have……enough stamina, though? I had just slept after all……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really? It won't be my fault if Lux-san run out of strength in the middle of the trip because you're lying here you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, well, I'll do my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct looked just like her usual self, but he also felt like that she was subtly different from usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like, it was as though she was sulking, or somewhat displeased……there was an implication within her words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, please wake up Celis-senpai soon and dress yourself. I will help if</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux-san need assistance with arranging your appearance though‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'll manage somehow……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do. Then, I shall be waiting outside."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct bowed quickly before she walked out with orderly steps.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn, Lux……. I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis opened her mouth slightly and talked in her sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux made a troubled sigh while arranging his appearance and woke up Celis.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 6</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux and co said their farewell to Lord Dist and returned to Cross Field's academy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally they were mostly travelling with Drag-Ride to shorten their travel time, but on the way home, Lux who was flying with Wyvern suddenly felt dizzy and staggered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux, are you okay!? Do you feel bad anywhere‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis woke up refreshingly after that and she was energetic like usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">She called out in panic to Lux while wearing Lindwurm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm just a bit tired……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? I felt a lot refreshed after sleeping soundly though‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was unable to sleep because of Celis instead, but what was with this stamina of hers?</p>
<p class="null-p">Even while thinking that, Lux felt content that he was able to snuggle close to her like this right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-by the way Lux? I was naked when I woke up but, what happened last night? Because of the wines my memory from the middle is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux faltered when Celis suddenly whispered that while gliding beside him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux hesitated to tell her about what happened last night if she had forgotten it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, that, Celis-senpai doesn't need to worry about it!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux averted his eyes and blushed. Celis panicked seeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please wait! What did I do!? Remaining silent is not permitted!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, I'll tell senpai someday. Right now is a bit‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">They were returning to their daily life while having such exchange.</p>
<p class="null-p">No.</p>
<p class="null-p">From here on, Celis would be a part of his daily life as one of his queens.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux digested that happiness while they returned to the Cross Field.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Episode 2 ‐ Under the Starry Sky of the Country of Snow (Krulcifer Chapter)</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">Several days later after returning to the academy from the inspection to the western territory with Celis.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time Lux was compelled to depart to an allied country that was Ymir Theocracy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Formally, it would be for conveying that Lux would become the next king and having audience with Pope Nias and requesting for the alliance between the two countries to continue.</p>
<p class="null-p">In short the trip was for greeting, but it was a state affairs that Lux had to do after the authority of Queen Raffi had moved to Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer called Lux several days before the departure.</p>
<p class="null-p">The blue haired girl was holding a pointer like a teacher while wearing glasses inside the drawing room of the academy at night that was illuminated by lamp.</p>
<p class="null-p">The objective of this study was two.</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer had summarized the information about Ymir Theocracy 's history and the current situation there from the news that she heard from her stepfather Count Stiyl Einfolk and Mel Gizalut of the Seven Dragon Paladins. He was teaching it to Lux as a prerequisite knowledge.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other objective was to give Lux supplementary lessons of the academy's lessons that Lux was falling behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was in a unique position where he was an officer cadet and also the next king at the same time. Because of that he was naturally busy with official business and unable to attend the class decently.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, considerable amount of credit was required to graduate, because of that Krulcifer with her top grade volunteered to be his teacher.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so she was teaching Lux one-to-one like this for several days until the day of departure to Ymir.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's how it is done. From the tendency until now, I think that this topic will come out in test, so let's learn it properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"R-right……, thank you. But Krulcifer-san"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it? If you have a question then don't hold back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux stiffened in bewilderment seeing Krulcifer who was replying to him with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a lot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since a week ago, the books for learning that were piled up in front of Lux's desk were forming a huge mound.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was literally a mountain of books.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Can we really finish all these?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now, I wonder about that. However‐if you want to graduate properly then there will be nothing better if you can finish them all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer chuckled with a brazen smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't say something like please go easy on me if she told him that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Lux who accepted the position as king, and it was also Lux who wished to stay as an officer cadet at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering the situation, there wouldn't be a problem even if he took temporary absence or withdrew from the academy but‐he didn't want to do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wanted to formally graduate from this academy that had accepted him and contained a lot of memories.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was said that he was being selfish then perhaps it was indeed correct.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this was without a doubt Lux's wish.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……By the way Krulcifer-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, as I thought it's nothing."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Ask me right away if there is something that you don't understand."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Lux wanted to ask wasn't something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He got the feeling that Krulcifer was acting strange since he returned to the academy from the inspection ot the western territory with Celis.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, on the surface there was nothing unusual and she was being the usual cool girl, but he was feeling a pressure that couldn't be hidden by her surface appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">(What's this? This thing that I'm feeling from Krulcifer-san……)</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't that she was simply angry.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he asked her to teach him, she normally taught him politely. She also summarized the lesson so that Lux could easily learn it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Considering that, she could be said as really kind instead but‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he got the feeling that she was different from usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the dense Lux was able to detect that as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here, tea. Also‐I have put together the schedule during our stay in Ymir Theocracy, you should check it later."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, it's a big help. Let's see‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The topic suddenly changed and Krulcifer handed him a schedule.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux read it and he was bewildered as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Krulcifer-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"This schedule, isn't it a bit harsh? Our stay there is extended for two days longer, if I don't shorten my time staying in the academy for this‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I guess. It can't be helped but I wonder if you can shorten your stay in the academy? There won't be any problem if Lux-kun work hard with the supplementary lessons."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was perplexed by Krulcifer's smile that seemed to contain a hidden meaning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, could it be……you're angry?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There's no such thing."</p>
<p class="null-p">When Lux asked with a wry smile, Krulcifer answered him right away with a cool expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, as I thought returning the schedule to before is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't you want to give it a try following this schedule for the time being?" When Lux asked one more time, Krulcifer replied to him right away with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I'll do my best."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux said that and grappled with the supplementary lessons for the part where he would be absent from the classes but‐at the middle he fell asleep. After that Krulcifer also gave up and in the end the number of days of his stay in Ymir didn't get extended.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then the day of departure finally arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be a trip to visit Ymir Theocracy for three days and two nights.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">The large country of the north, Ymir Theocracy was cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">If one treated the winter here like in the winter at the second month of new kingdom and dressed accordingly, they might possibly freeze to death if they forcefully marched through the cold here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux and Krulcifer and their bodyguards the Triad were continuing to move through such cold with their Drag-Ride.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because heat was transmitted from the Force Core, it didn't feel cold even when they were only wearing pilot suit, but if they dispelled the Drag-Ride they were wearing, they would immediately return to the world of extreme cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore everyone kept moving while wearing their Drag-Ride. They would build a windbreak and fire during their break before getting out of their DragRide. They would catch cold if they didn't do that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Tillfur's Wyrm and Noct's Drake couldn't fly, everyoen inevitably had to match their speed with the two who were advancing on the snow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, if Lux and Krulcifer went at full speed by themselves, they would finish traveling in half a time. But they were heading to a foreign country, so it was judged that bodyguards were needed as expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had several breaks during the trip before they finally arrived at the capital of Ymir Theocracy at the afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they headed to the main gate of the temple, Mel Gizalut of the Seven Dragon Paladins was the one to meet them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Long time no see. Not even one month has passed but‐. Onii-chan, are you alright? You look a bit tired there‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I'm fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">The young girl with platinum hair only gave a brief greeting before she stared at Lux with a dubious face.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Lux smiled to pretend that nothing was wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Krulcifer, did you do something?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Not really."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, no matter. It doesn't look like that you're in a really bad state, let's go."</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer purified her body first before they stepped inside the temple together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux finished his audience with the young Pope Nias and they agreed with the continuation of the alliance.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that there was a banquet, but the meal of the pious believers was modest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had properly received the instruction about the manners here from Krulcifer before entering the country.</p>
<p class="null-p">The manners for the meal, the way to act within the temple, the procedure for prayer, Lux did them all without trouble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well then King Lux, pardon me with this."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the parting, Mel Gizalut came to see them off and bowed respectfully. She was choosing her words and gesture properly when in public.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she looked childish, she was progressing forward as a noble</p>
<p class="null-p">lady and as a Drag-Knight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Take care of yourself too Lady Mel. Please contact us if something happen.</p>
<p class="null-p">I promise that we will surely be of assistance as an ally."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm extremely delighted to hear that, your majesty."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a conversation that was following formality, but they were sporting an easy smile in contrast of their usage of stiff and formal words.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past Lux had also saved this country and Mel from danger.</p>
<p class="null-p">They fought side by side as comrade-in-arms at the previous grand battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Stay well, Onii-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her eyes were saying that to him mischievously.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed she also had a talk about something with Krulcifer just now, but would she tell him what they were talking about?</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing his official duty at the capital's temple and having a talk, Lux and co headed to Krulcifer's‐Einfolk House's villa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer's family, starting from her stepfather Stiyl, her stepbrother Zain, and even her step sisters, all of them had gathered there.</p>
<p class="null-p">The one person who was the most nostalgic even among them was the butler Alterize.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I've been waiting impatiently for this day to come, Lux-sama‐no, your majesty the king."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just call me Lux. We are already outside the public's eye after all." Lux replied with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps having to repeat this kind of talk every time was the most inconvenient thing for him right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, how about you also act without any reserve here? Right now this place has also become your home after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"True. Then, I'm home."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux followed the encouragement of Zain who was now his brother-in-law and he was shown into the living room.</p>
<p class="null-p">A modest welcoming banquet was held once more.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">The people of Ymir Theocracy wouldn't do something like making merry stupidly because of their religion's teaching.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the snow that was continuing to fall silently, Krulcifer made the banquet finished early and invited Lux outside.</p>
<p class="null-p">The fourth Ruin, Hall.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a place that could be called as Krulcifer's other home as the Key's Supervisor. The two of them were heading there.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We might have to spend some more effort there but, can I ask you to come with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">They had already received the permission to enter the Ruin from Pope Nias. Their job would be to check the management inside the Ruin.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Ruin should have been made to stop functioning in order to seal the technology and legacy of the past inside‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">There should be nobody else who could enter this place anymore, but there were countless people who wanted to steal those legacy and technology.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course there were guards assigned to this place but‐checking the condition inside periodically was also a duty of Krulcifer as the Key's Supervisor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm fine with that but‐will it be alright? The two of us going outside alone like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I'll tell Alterize and my family before we go."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux nodded seeing Krulcifer making an unusually quiet face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Leaving behind the Triad who were accompanying them to Ymir as their guards in Einfolk House, they departed to the Ruin at the late at night that had become completely silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Presently‐there shouldn't be any danger of Abyss appearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was also no conspicuous banditry by Drag-Knight organization right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the two of them wore their Drag-Ride and vigilantly arrived at the Ruin.</p>
<p class="null-p">They greeted the guards while heading to the designated place. There they were transferred to inside with a faint light.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Long time no see dearimasu! Xfer-sama‐no, Krulcifer-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It has been a while Ney. Has there been anything unusual here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was an Automata with mechanical dog ears.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ney Louches came to greet them.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Automatas were the managers of the Ruins. They were programmed so they fundamentally wouldn't listen to anyone's order except the Key's Supervisors and the Lords.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, currently the Ruins weren't producing Abyss or manufacturing DragRide.</p>
<p class="null-p">Far from that‐, works were being carried out to erase the past legacy and technology.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The only problem is how boring it is here dearimasu. No one is coming here after all. But‐as requested, I have made the arrangement for today!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, thank you. I'm thankful for your work."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No no, it's not that much though‐dearimasu."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ney leaned her head forward like an actual dog.</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer smiled at that and patted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This place is‐. Could it be, the Ruin's lodging?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I asked Ney to activate one of the rooms in the residential quarter."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two were shown into deep inside the Hall and found a peculiar lodging facility there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Strangely that room had no ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Above them there was the moon that was shining brightly and the azure night sky that was illuminated by that moonlight.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐, the snows that were fluttering in the sky were sparkling.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a space with fairytale-like……and beautiful mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was no cold, and the snow also didn't fall into the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that the night sky was projected inside the room through a screen but‐the way it was set up it felt like the ceiling itself didn't exist.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet despite the sight, the room that was illuminated faintly by a lamp was warm.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a table and sofa with smooth shape. There were also chilled glasses and the like nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I found this room together with Mel in the previous investigation. This place looks like a lodging facility. Then I asked Ney to repaired it so it can be used."</p>
<p class="null-p">Compared to the other Ruins, the Hall‐had a larger aspect of being a vault, or perhaps a shelter.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed there was no no more resident here but, it looked like the facility was still functioning if it was restored.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's stay here today. We can return to Einfolk House tomorrow afternoon, so let's take it easy here."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Say, Krulcifer-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's the matter? You don't like this kind of room perhaps?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux showed a bewildered expression toward Krulcifer who was nonchalantly saying her suggestion.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't this, mixing public and private affairs unprofessionally……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Although it was just a lodging facility, it was a fact that Krulcifer was ordering the restoration of a Ruin's function, so Lux questioned whether this could be considered as an improper use of Ruin.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Krulcifer who heard that sighed with an uncharacteristic exasperated expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Look here. You are going to have a lot of concerns from now on if you are being that serious you know? Well, that's really just like you though……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this really okay……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We came here in order to check the management of the Ruin. Even if the work get dragging on and because of that we have to stay the night here, there won't be any problem. Ney also think so right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just like Krulcifer-sama say dearimasu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Ney's mechanical dog ears stood up and she agreed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It feels like you are making her say that though……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux retorted with a small voice, but it only got lightly ignored.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he actually felt like there wouldn't be any particular problem with them staying the night here.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Even so, why did Krulcifer-san arrange this kind of schedule?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux took a rest inside the room while he suddenly turned pensive.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Krulcifer made Lux rest, she was checking with Ney Louches about the records and information that were left behind in the Ruin.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed there wasn't any new survivor of the old era that had been discovered, and there were also no intruder who came here.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Drag-Knights that each country possessed had been greatly reduced in the previous great battle, because of that there was also no a large group that was trying to infiltrate the Ruin.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although that was only the situation at the present time. It was necessary to continue managing the Ruin with great caution‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Rest here Lux-kun. I'll go change my clothes for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, okay. Then, just for a bit‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer and Ney left the room. The slight tension that was remaining in Lux was dispelled with them gone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, his fatigue flooded him and dragged him into a light sleep.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux-sama. How are you feeling right now dearimasu?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn……. Wait, what's this!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Lux opened his eyes, there was a cord lengthening from the bed where he was sleeping on until now that was connected to his body.</p>
<p class="null-p">The upper part of his pilot suit was taken off, but he didn't feel cold because of the heater.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's just a simple device to accelerate recovery. Recovery speed that is several times faster than simply sleeping normally can be expected from it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The moon was still shining dazzlingly when he looked up at the sky above.</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't seem like too much time had passed since then.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? You have woken up. It'll be fine even if you sleep until morning though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Inside the silent room, there was Krulcifer who had changed from her pilot suit into a deep blue dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have changed into that while Lux was sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hair was tied on her back and she smiled at him with a graceful appearance.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be, Krulcifer-san expressly took me here for this‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Did she arrange a rest schedule for Lux who had been tired recently?</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's half correct but‐it's also half wrong. That's not my original objective, this is like a bit of atonement."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Atonement……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux tilted his head at that answer that was completely outside of his expectation.</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was doing that, Krulcifer was just staring at the screen of the night sky‐at the moon amidst the falling snow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, because this time I made you forced yourself too hard for my own convenience."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression from the side looked somewhat lonely when she muttered that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt puzzled seeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer spoke further before Lux could ask her what she meant.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her cheeks were slightly red. It might be because she had opened the wine that was brought here.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So you haven't noticed. Well, it's just like you Lux-kun‐. I want to spend a long a long time with you in this trip. That was also why I made that study meeting go longer like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was simply a need to economize the time even more if she wanted to make time within Lux's hard schedule.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Krulcifer-san thought, that made me tired?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I unconsciously‐no, it's unfair to say it like that. I was purposefully arranging it to be like that. Though I pretended to be ignorant."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">After heading to the western territory with Celis, Krulcifer proactively played the role as Lux's lecturer in order to compensate for all the lessons that Lux had fallen behind until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly, Lux himself had to admit that he had it hard with all the lessons, but,</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not the case. In the first place it was I myself who decided to keep being an officer cadet while also being a king at the same time. Krulcifer-san, you were doing your best to help me so that I can do just that."</p>
<p class="null-p">That was Lux's honest feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Though it seemed that Krulcifer had casually increased the amount he had to study within one day because she wanted to make a time to be together with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">But in the first place it was thanks to Krulcifer that he was able to shorten the time he needed to study.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Krulcifer smiled with a troubled look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That answer is really like you Lux-kun. But you know‐, I was thinking this during that study meeting. I want to spend time longer with you. Surely, I felt anxious in my heart that you were taken by Celis-senpai‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"About the matter of you becoming king, I want to believe that I made that suggestion with a calm mind, but it was actually an exasperating act if I say so myself. I acted like I was the calmest person there, and yet I was the one who felt the deepest jealousy among everyone. That's why, I admonished myself and arranged this for atonement."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Krulcifer-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Krulcifer who suggested that Lux married Lisha as hi queen while marrying the other four as his concubines if he became king.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the wish to monopolize Lux was welling up subconsciously within her‐she was confessing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that she noticed what she was doing after seeing Lux staggering from fatigue and returned to her sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that was why now‐the time they were spending in this Ruin was for Lux to get a break.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Lux didn't think like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He stood up wearing the white robe that was put on him while he was sleeping and walked to sit face to face with Krulcifer.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, he asked Ney to bring him one more glass.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's wrong? Why don't you lay down to rest instead?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm thinking to enjoy the night scene of Ymir Theocracy too. This is a rare chance after all, and Krulcifer-san has also prepared this kind of lodging for it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You aren't, angry with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer casually averted her gaze, but Lux answered with a shake of his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm thankful instead. After all I was able to act properly in the temple all thanks to Krulcifer-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled with a wine glass in one hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are kind like usual. But‐that's why I'm feeling uneasy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are loved by a lot of girls. It made me scared since a long time ago.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I understand that you are someone loved."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Since a long time ago, err‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"See. You are really dense. When you saved me from Balzerite, when you called at me the Garden while I was stricken with feeling of solitude, I was already in love with you since then."</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer told him that while her hand gently touched Lux's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she quietly kissed him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Krulcifer, san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How troubling, even though I thought that I would be able to act like a perfect human in order to be accepted by Einfolk House‐, by the people of this era, it's like I become completely hopeless when it come to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer said that with a self-depreciating smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's heart pounded loudly in his chest seeing her sensual emotional smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer was found by Einfolk House in this Hall and they adopted her. She was raised with her surrounding treating her like a tumor.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a countermeasure so that other people wouldn't learn about Krulcifer's origin and tried to make use of her with malicious intention, even so that was fundamentally still a lonely life.</p>
<p class="null-p">This intelligent girl harbored wariness to get close to other people that was stronger than anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her subconscious wish to monopolize Lux must be the flipside of the loneliness of this girl who was usually more composed than anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even her who was intelligent, strong, beautiful, and perfect was still a girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was harboring such passionate feeling toward him‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was an awkward girl who felt that her feeling that was seeking for Lux was sinful. To Lux, he felt that she was awfully lovely.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, he sat beside Krulcifer and firmly embraced Krulcifer's slender body before whispering into her ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I am, really happy."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut/illustrations/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut_vol_20_8.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm happy that Krulcifer-san is thinking about me that deeply. That's why, don't feel anxious."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's, foul play."</p>
<p class="null-p">Seeing Lux's smile, Krulcifer blushed shyly and averted her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My feeling will waver if you tell me something like that. It makes me want to cling on you endlessly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's fine. At the very least right now‐there are only the two of us here after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that so? Then, I won't hold back. Perhaps I should ask you to let me stay by your side."</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer moved closer to Lux's side and snuggled up to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she entwined her arm and fingers with his while looking up to the silent snowy scene.</p>
<p class="null-p">A soundless time silently lapsed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so she was feeling fulfilled without the slightest feeling of dissatisfaction or anxiety.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I had been wanting to come here all this time. Together with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, the last time we came here, everyone also came along in the end. It was nice in its own way with how lively it was though‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is also that but, it's because this place is my birthplace."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if it's just for form's sake, I wanted to report it. That I'm able to properly fall in love with someone of this era. That I'm not alone anymore."I'm glad."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's face relaxed and he smiled. Krulcifer brought her face even closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you Lux-kun. I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">A peaceful and blazing feeling enveloped the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">When they noticed, the sky that was projected on the ceiling cleared up and the radiant sun was climbing high up in the sky.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, both of you, thanks for your hard work this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">At the afternoon of the next day.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them hurriedly finished the inspection of the Ruin and returned to the villa of Einfolk House. After finishing the preparation to return back to the new kingdom‐Mel of the Seven Dragon Paladins expressly came to see them off.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looking at you two right now, it looks like you two were able to make up with each other properly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes‐. Thanks to you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer smiled at Mel after she pointed that out and her arms twined around Lux's arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">Did you make Lux force himself without realizing it‐? It was none other than Mel who warned Krulcifer of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa……. As I thought, perhaps it would be better to not tell you. It's really irritating seeing you two flirting right in front of me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Mel said that with a conflicted and exasperated face. Lux panicked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err……Krulcifer-san. We are still in public place more or less here so‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My, isn't it fine. We are formally engaged with each other, so there isn't any problem at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly at Krulcifer who was mischievously picking a quarrel with Mel.</p>
<p class="null-p">How should he say it, she was acting like herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like she had returned to how she was before after so long.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, should we return? Back to the new kingdom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux-sama, please take care of Ojou-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">Starting from the butler Alterize, the members of Einfolk House also said their farewell, and then Lux and others equipped their Drag-Ride and left the country.</p>
<p class="null-p">As soon as they got out of the theocracy, the Triad who were on standby as guards showed a weary expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why‐are you three looking that tired I wonder? You three didn't have a good rest yesterday night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Triad had been told beforehand that Lux and Krulcifer would stay the night in the Ruin, and they were staying in the detached mansion of Einfolk House, so there shouldn't be any reason for them to be fatigued‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We also thought that we would be able to rest. Cause those people, from a glance they looked like a dry bunch‐but that was a miscalculation." Tillfur who was gliding on the snow field with her Wyrm let out a long sigh. Sharis who was flying beside Lux and Krulcifer also hung her head down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"While the two of you were gone, they called out for the continuation of the banquet. They asked us a lot of prying questions nosily, like how is the standing of miss Krulcifer among the five fiancées, or how are the two of you getting along."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It was horrible. In various sense."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Noct was sending them a resentful gaze. Lux and Krulcifer guessed what happened from seeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed, Lux and Krulcifer were more blessed than they expected.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry for what my family had done. I was unable to really talk with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">They must not wish to take Lux and Krulcifer's time and troubled them because they knew how busy the two of them were.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, they were still curious, so they made the Triad to accompany their talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, although those members of Einfolk House looked like a reserved bunch from a glance, they were actually worried for Krulcifer‐it seemed that was how it was.</p>
<p class="null-p">"They are really troublesome."</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer unusually laughed with a bright expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It looks like Krulcifer-san has taken after them without really realizing it. Even if they are not blood related family."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were really similar with Krulcifer in how they were pretending to be cold on the surface so that other wouldn't realize they were actually deeply affectionate people.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl from the past era who was discovered in the Ruin had certainly obtained family in this era.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's make a proper schedule next time so that you can spend time with my family."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I'll also work hard so we can take our time slowly next time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you. I'm glad that I was able to return here with you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer glided beside Lux while holding out Fafnir's armored arm lightly toward him.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Lux also held out his Wyvern's armored arm so the armored arm of their Drag-Ride touched each other lightly. The two of them smiled. "Why are you two having a nice talk by yourself in your own world."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep yep……. What about our position after coming along until Ymir Theocracy like this as guards……. In the end we aren't even doing that guard job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Next time we will push the troublesome matters to you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait-……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Triad spewed out resentful words while glancing at Lux and Krulcifer who were smiling at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux tried to soothe the three of them in panic. Krulcifer watched him cheerfully while flying through the azure sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">Krulcifer was convinced that she didn't have any place to belong in this era.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Lux always made her realized that she had a place to belong, that she could make one for herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hey, Lux-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Krulcifer-san too, help me out here. Getting the three of them back into good mood is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. Very much so."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux stiffened seeing Krulcifer smiling at him with an expression of deep love and reddened cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">Usually she was a cool girl, but that made the face she was making right now to stab into his chest even deeper than it should.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a moment of silence, the Triad who was witnessing that scene took some distance and started whispering to each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, everyone‐you three are still more or less my bodyguards……"</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like that even the return trip to the new kingdom that would take half a day would be enjoyable.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Episode 3 ‐ Relationship With Childhood Friend (Philuffy Chapter)</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">After returning back to the new kingdom from Ymir Theocracy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux devoted himself to his student life in Cross Field once more while also doing his official duty as the next king.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been flying in his Drag-Ride during these several days, and he was able to travel anywhere within half a day but‐. Recently the time he asked the Triad to transport him had increased in order to save his stamina.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then tonight, there would be an evening party at Aingram Company for announcing the engagement, so Lux had to head to the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">His wedding with Philuffy was scheduled to be carried out after the second year's promotion for the time being but‐Relie was giving Lux an invitation before that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only natural but, it was important to have a connection with company for the conveniences of managing the commodities in the new kingdom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy's big sister and Aingram Company's head Relia was well known among the wealthy people and the major merchants. Because of that she was able to gather those people in one building.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that Relie wanted to spread the name of Lux who would become the new king as well as advertising his engagement with Philuffy grandly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so she held an evening party in the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the banquet hall of a high class hotel that had just opened‐the party that gathered the wealthy people from the new kingdom and other countries was started.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Allow me to express my greeting to the hero of the new kingdom and the first male king……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Congratulations for your majesty's engagement. In our company‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Quickly a line was formed in front of Lux. The wealthy merchants were swarming him to give him their greeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he was overwhelmed, Lux responded to them one by one.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Well, this is necessary, but it's still mentally tiring……)</p>
<p class="null-p">For a country's management‐cooperating with the companies had become indispensable.</p>
<p class="null-p">Securing commodities, the employment situation of the people, the change of prices.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the power relationship between the country and merchants, neither side must be too powerful from the other but‐a case where the balance was kept was actually rare.</p>
<p class="null-p">After all these merchants were far trickier compared to the unskillful nobles.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only natural. No one could become rich unless they were smart, much less maintaining their riches or even expanding it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, negotiating with this kind of clever men was extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be a piece of cake for them to deceive Lux who never dabbled in commerce using various methods.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before he realized it they could create a situation that would make him write a contract that greatly benefited them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course‐he had received advice from Relie and prepared countermeasures, but he felt like he would be swallowed whole if he carelessly talked to them.</p>
<p class="null-p">That kind of capable merchant was also troublesome, but there was one more matter that was worrying Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">Mainly it was the bunch that was profiting from their vested interests. They were drawing close to those in the authority and concentrated all their effort in building "mechanism for the winners" lawfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">In case their method was being too malicious, the king Lux would have to pretend to placate them while destroying the mechanism of their vested interests.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that was essentially impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">The half-baked law was on their side, so it would be difficult to knock them down.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, he had to avoid these people who were drawing closer to him in order to pass the law that would strengthen their vested interests.</p>
<p class="null-p">They would be offended if he strongly denied or refused them, and it might also affect his policy in the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was difficult to find the balance in this area, so Relie had to frequently step in and made a reason for them.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there was no denying that Relie too was a head of a conglomerate but‐she was fully respecting Lux's thinking as the king.</p>
<p class="null-p">(She should be acting for my sake‐right……?)</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh? About that matter, our Aingram Company is in charge of it. Yes, my little sister will soon marry‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't help from feeling somewhat anxious when watching Reli's smile while negotiating.</p>
<p class="null-p">The connection of the new kingdom with Aingram Company had been strong since the start, but it felt like the power relationship was increasingly tilting to one side thanks to Lux getting engaged with Philuffy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Simply put, people who wanted to enter under the umbrella of Aingram Company to get their slice of pie were appearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">(But, depending on how I think about it‐, perhaps I should be thankful?)</p>
<p class="null-p">The merchants first came to greet Relie who was the head of Aingram Conglomerate that was the purveyor to the kingdom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Indirectly through Relie, it became possible to grasp their intention and movement in general.</p>
<p class="null-p">The problem was that it could be said that the situation would be largely controlled by Relie.</p>
<p class="null-p">Relie would be happy as long as Philuffy was happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, as long as Lux's relationship with Philuffy was going well, Relie wouldn't be uncooperative with him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Amidst that, he found a girl who was wearing pure white dress in the middle of this banquet.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl with pink hair had her hair tied into ponytail. She was conspicuously beautiful even when seen from afar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Ah, Lu-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for your effort today, Phi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Relie and Lux were busy, so at the beginning she was standing at the main position of the night party like a symbol.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux laughed because it was really like Philuffy the way she continued to eat the party's lavish food silently.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even with other merchants and nobles surrounding her, she maintained her own pace and she only kept repeating "Thank you, very much" when they congratulated her about the engagement.</p>
<p class="null-p">The merchants who tried to approach her with the ulterior motive of currying favor with one of the future queens were left utterly helpless.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, as expected even Philuffy would give a different reaction when talking with Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was expressionless and going on her own pace like usual, but he could see that her lips were slightly smiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's eat, together. I have brought the portion, for Lu-chan. You won't be able to stay spirited, without eating you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……. Thank you, Phi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">The tension left Lux's shoulders seeing Philuffy telling him that while carrying with one hand a large plate with foods piled on it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though he was in a location where he had to carry out his duty as the king, he was able to return to be the usual Lux just with her presence here.</p>
<p class="null-p">Besides‐she was beautiful.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy was wearing a pure white dress that was decorated with laces and a veil on her head, perhaps because of the awareness of the coming marriage ceremony in the near future. It made Philuffy's translucent beauty to be even more prominent.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't just feeling nostalgia toward his childhood friend, but also an impulse that exhilarated his heart welling up inside him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"King Lux. About the project of our company‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"In regard to the tax of imported goods……"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Lux got surrounded by the guests once more and he was very busily occupied during the evening party.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so he would talk with Philuffy briefly every time there was a chance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just from that he could let go his tension and relaxed.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">When a company reached the level of Aingram Conglomerate, it would have a vast number of business partners as well as other people involved in it in many diverse fields.</p>
<p class="null-p">New guests visited one after another to where Lux and Relie were standing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Relie was a merchant from the beginning so she was used to dealing with them, but something like this wasn't Lux's forte, so he was accumulating fatigue from it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lu-chan. I feel, sleepy and dizzy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phi-chan!? Are you alright? ……I'm sorry, it seems she isn't feeling good, so allow me to excuse myself temporarily."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux said that and shook off the guests swarming around him to bring Philuffy to the inn's break room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux himself was also tired, but he lent Philuffy his shoulder and went outside. Then he looked around the corridor that had gorgeous design.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, if I'm not mistaken, the location of the empty break room is‐]</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need, to search for it you know? I know the way."</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after Lux looked around to search for someone to show the way‐, Philuffy who was leaning limply on him until now straightened hre back and lightly lifted up Lux instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by‐……wah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was bewildered by what suddenly happened. Philuffy carried him in his arms and entered the room that was for the inn's owner.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Philuffy took off her luxurious dress and began to change in her underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that Philuffy herself wasn't feeling unwell or drunk or anything. She was acting in order to bring out Lux from the party.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait!? Your underwear is showing! Why are you suddenly changing clothes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is also the clothing for Lu-chan. Let's go outside?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that while throwing a dress suit and a coat to Lux too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……? Right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. The work is already over."</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy finished changing clothes to look like a normal city girl in the blink of eye. Then Lux slipped out of the expensive inn together with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, Lux followed Philuffy's invitation and went out to the capital's street.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">The streets of the capital at night were bright.</p>
<p class="null-p">Several weeks had passed since it was announced that Queen Raffi had died from sickness. The tumult of the capital was starting to return little by little.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was because Lisha had declared that Lux would ascend to be the new king and inherited her will as the princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the announcement that Raffi died from sickness was only the reason. The matter of Raffi getting possessed by the Sacred Eclipse was kept a secret.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no need to tell the people about that gruesome incident and spread anxiety among them.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why at the surface this country stayed peaceful.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Lux was aware just how difficult it was to maintain the peace.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so‐this night scenery was special.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, Phi-chan. What happened? Didn't you feel unwell……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I got a slight feeling, that someone is targeting us in that hall."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was surprised by Philuffy's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The surrounding of the building was monitored by a Drake's Radar during the evening party. The Triad should also be taking the bodyguard role but‐someone had slipped through that security?</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it was just my imagination. Maybe……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The current Lux wasn't just a hero who had saved the world from danger.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was the human closes to the secret of Avalon where the legacy of the ancient era was sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the surface it was said that Avalon had been destroyed and vanished without any trace but‐there must be countless criminals who suspected that it was hidden somewhere and targeted Lux to obtain it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, as expected they still needed to be on their guard even when it was peaceful.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, the influence of Abyss had been removed from Philuffy, but her natural-born instinct and her martial art that was directly learned from Magialca were still going strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy was the one saying there was someone targeting them, so it was possible there really was some kind of danger approaching‐Lux had an idea of what it might be.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, there wasn't any particular problem with them doing this for the time being.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Lu-chan, disguise yourself with this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy was walking while handing a hat and a muffler to Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">Those were to hide Lux's conspicuous silver hair as much as possible.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, we are seriously going?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We will, return to Onee-chan's inn later. Let's play until then."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is this really okay……. Slipping out like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though the evening party was more or less for announcing the engagement between Lux and Philuffy…</p>
<p class="null-p">Also‐people who wanted to talk business numbered overwhelmingly a lot more than people who came simply to give their blessing to Lux and Philuffy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think it's fine to not deal with them too seriously. It's tiring."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just that much isn't much trouble. Relie-san was also teaching me how to deal with them."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly and acted strong, but Philuffy's clear gaze was staring still at Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I thought, Lu-chan is forcing yourself. Lying is, no good."</p>
<p class="null-p">He wondered how she knew that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt flustered in his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">No‐he really intended to learn to become able to deal with such people skilfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, with Philuffy telling him that wasn't the case, as expected he too felt like he had been forcing himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy sometimes showed strength that wouldn't let him argue anything back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Besides, this too is the king's job."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Shopping like a normal people, at the city. It's work too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy had thought up an excuse too just in case. It was a bit amusing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps this too was her growing up in her own way.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hand softly took Lux's hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">How many times he had hold hand with her like this since they were kids?</p>
<p class="null-p">The warmth of that hand and the nostalgic sensation made him let out a sigh of relieve.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. Let's go, Phi-chan."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's lips naturally loosened into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">It was snowing at the winter night in the capital. Lux and Philuffy were walking amidst such night scenery.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's cold, so let's walk closer to each other?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah……. You're right."</p>
<p class="null-p">Their shoulder got closer to each other. Her body was warm and the feeling of her hand that he was holding felt pleasant.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart and his body that he had steeled to such degree until before this felt like they were being softened.</p>
<p class="null-p">They viewed the merchandises in the stalls. They also drank alcohol in the bar because they were unable to at the party. After that the two of them were walking through the city.</p>
<p class="null-p">When choosing clothes in a tailor, they visited a shop that was affiliated with Aingram. The staffs there were surprisingly understanding when they were told that the two of them were undercover.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that the way Relie doted on her little sister was a well-known fact even within the company.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the three days of the parade that were looped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy was staying in bed due to the influence of the Abyss that was taking root in her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so she chose to not tell her feeling to Lux in order to not make him worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely that was because it would make Lux feeling obliged toward her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that while only thinking of Lux's happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come to think of it. Lu-chan, are you fine with it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The time grew late.</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost all the shops that had stayed open until this late were closing except for the bars. It felt like they were going to be left alone in this world of night. It was at such timing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy suddenly asked him that question when they were going to return to Relie's high class inn.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux didn't understand the meaning of her question and tilted his head slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then a sentence that he never even expected came to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About, marrying with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">His childhood friend asked him that with her usual tone and expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">When Krulcifer suggested him marrying all five of them, Philuffy didn't express any agreement or refusal.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, she only acted like that doing the marriage was only natural.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux too deliberately didn't confirm about her intent.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, why was Philuffy asking that right now when she didn't say anything at that time?</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phi-chan‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux hesitated to say just as he was about to ask.</p>
<p class="null-p">His heart was trembling seeing her peaceful gaze that was staring at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aa, he thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while, Lux finally noticed what Philuffy was asking him.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was always saying it.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was telling him that it was alright for him to not be tied up with her existence.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was fine for him to not feel indebted to her even more than this for what happened at their childhood.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was fine to not feel any sense of obligation from her saving Lux and Lux saving her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted Lux to grasp his own happiness without feeling any reservation. She was thinking like that from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux who learned that from the loops of that three days of parade became increasingly unable to let go of Philuffy.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had noticed at that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">That Lux was in love with Philuffy.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Lux too‐felt scared of tying up Philuffy to him, he also felt scared of losing Philuffy who had been a symbol of serenity for him until now. He was unable to speak his feeling to her just because of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Philuffy had erased even the seed of the Abyss in her heart with the power of Baptism.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was nothing more threatening her life.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was saying that she didn't want to bind Lux's feeling to her with debt of gratitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phi-chan‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't want to marry with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was going to say that at first, but he changed his words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The words that came out was flowing through the empty air of night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you being that considerate to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy stared back at Lux with a puzzled gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">He already knew about half of the answer to that question even before asking.</p>
<p class="null-p">He got acquainted with her when they were young. Lux covered for Philuffy when she was about to be framed by his step siblings.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy saw through Lux's kindness at that time and put her trust on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">She stayed at the side of Lux who was the youngest son in the old imperial family and didn't have any friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">After his mother died in accident, she frequently visited Lux for his sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy's earnest kindness.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had been saved by that all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had lived on until now with that feeling as his support even when in loneliness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you, being this kind to me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">It was strange in a sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, surely for her it was simply something "obvious"‐now he was trying to ask her about that matter that he had never asked or even considered himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know. There is, no particular reason."</p>
<p class="null-p">Unexpectedly the reply came instantly from the blank faced Philuffy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps, because it's what I wanted to do." She said that with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">She told him her answer without any falsehood.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't because of sympathy toward Lux, or because of her kindness from a feeling of charity‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was because she wanted to be at his side that she did that.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Aa‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux understood after hearing Philuffy's voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place it was a mistake to feel uneasy just because there was no reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">If it was a reason then there had been one right from the very beginning. He was simply unable to see it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yeah. I also, want the same like that. I want Phi-chan, to be by my side forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are, the same aren't we."</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy said that and reduced their distance evne closer.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time stopped at the street of the capital at night where there were no more people outside, with the two of them were still in disguise.</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any need for a specific reason for them to stay at each other's side.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a reason attached because of their respective unique situation and upbringing.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐it was simply them creating reason because of the various situations that kept piling up, making them harboring doubt that the other was only at their side because of some kind of circumstance.</p>
<p class="null-p">But actually he had been in love with her without him realizing it all this time since the past. Just that feeling was already enough reason for him to stay at her side. Their heart was connected with that understanding.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">They brought back the items they bought and returned to the high-class inn. There the evening party was already over.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Relie who noticed that Lux and Philuffy were going out alone with each other was in a good mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">Also, the Triad who should be his bodyguards were staring at him resentfully because of the free time they got after their protection target ran away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so‐Lux thought that there was no problem with his safety during his outing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their disguise……wasn't really the reason. He had a guess about the presence that Philuffy sensed during the evening party.</p>
<p class="null-p">The prediction that Lux had in mind‐was most likely not mistaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My my? Looks like you have had a lot more fun compared to the party over here aren't you, Phi. Were you able to escort Lux-kun properly?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Relie must have been waiting all this time for the two of them to come back.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was walking unsteadily with a face that was red from being drunk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Onee-chan, you're drinking too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fiiine. No matter what Phi is now engaged with Lux-kun. There is no day more auspicious day than this. Onee-chan is also thinking a lot about the big day of the wedding ceremony so‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the event lover Relie they were talking about, so it felt like she was going t do something outrageous. It made him felt a bit anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, he had the feeling that it would surely be fun if he was together with Philuffy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, the bath has been prepared for the test run. The Triad has entered first, but right now it should be completely empty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I understand. I'll give it a try."</p>
<p class="null-p">Regardless of everything, the outside was cold.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore, it seemed this inn was built in a position where hot spring came out, so he was also looking forward to it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Relie then immediately drank herself unconscious after that. He parted from her and headed to the large bath at the first floor together with Philuffy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Go in first Phi-chan. I'll be fine entering it later so‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……? Why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux said that in consideration of Philuffy's modesty, but she replied to him with her usual vacant expression and tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's because we can't enter together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The bath, is spacious you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"We are, fiancée……now, aren't we?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy's innocent gaze was fixed toward Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were engaged, they understood each other's feeling, furthermore they were alone with each other‐there wasn't any reason to refuse.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he was forced to make an excuse, it was only because he was embarrassed and the stimulation would be too strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, then, that's. Let's enter……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux deliberately psyched up himself and replied.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their relationship wasn't something vague like childhood friend anymore. He recognized Philuffy as his lover, and as his fiancee. He wanted to show his determination to her too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, this bathroom. Its light can be weakened and entered with the room as dark as it is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see. Then perhaps it will be fine……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt relieved in his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">He entered the changing room ahead of Philuffy and headed to the bathroom. The lighting of place was certainly dim.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could only see slightly ahead within the range of his hand.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bathroom that was illuminated with faint orange light was spacious and had a calm mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Calm down‐with the position of Phi-chan and me right now, I'm not doing anything strange right now……)</p>
<p class="null-p">He was already mentally flustered at the point he needed to persuade himself like that but‐he tried to not think about it deeply.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a sense, their relationship that had been remaining in one place until now would advance until the very last stop, so it would be stranger if he could keep his calm.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Rattle*.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy entered inside while he was lightly washing his body at the washing place.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was relieved because the place was dim and he couldn't see but‐, his heart jumped inside his chest seeing her silhouette that was hidden by the dim light.</p>
<p class="null-p">A voluptuous curve that symbolized femininity.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet that body was lean from learning martial arts.</p>
<p class="null-p">The abundant breasts that were hidden by a single thin towel caught his eyes regardless of his intention.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before this too there was one time‐they entered a bathroom together because of Relie's scheme, but Philuffy's charm had increased even more than that time.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, this was different from that time that was an accident. Right now they were sharing this time with the consent from both sides.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he thought that, blood rushed rapidly into Lux's head even though he hadn't even entered the hot water.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This bathroom, is wide as expected."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-you're right……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux averted his gaze from Philuffy while raising his voice stiffly.</p>
<p class="null-p">After he lightly poured hot water over his body at the washing place, Philuffy sat down and began to wash her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Haa, that was dangerous……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">To think it would be this different when he got conscious of her after becoming her lover.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux took a deep breath while entering the bathtub.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was the sound of flowing hot spring water in the bathtub.</p>
<p class="null-p">The lamp's light was illuminating the bathroom faintly. It was displaying Philuffy's beauty even more sublimely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lu-chan, you didn't wash your body?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Hm, no……. After this I'll‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux soaked himself into the bathtub and relaxed while closing his eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">He confirmed that Philuffy had returned, and then he also headed toward the washing place.</p>
<p class="null-p">(But‐how should I say it, this is nostalgic.)</p>
<p class="null-p">When they were still children, he had entered a bath together with Philuffy too in Relie's house.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, they could have fun without caring about status or position.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lu-chan. I'll, wash your back."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Thank you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux reflexively nodded while washing his front.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Right right, if I remember right we also had this kind of conversation before‐……wait!?)</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy had approached him without giving off her presence. She pressed a towel on Lux's back from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course‐she was stark naked.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her breasts were hidden slightly but, they had a volume that couldn't be hidden completely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Phi-chan!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……? What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it's nothing!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux reflexively turned around, but then he returned his gaze to the front in panic so he wouldn't see her naked body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy was tilting her head with her cheeks slightly reddening from the heat of the bathroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This is bad……! Even though the lighting is dim, as expected it's visible when we are this close……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition, Lux's eyes were also getting used to the darkness, so he could see almost as clearly as usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rubbing sensation on his back, and then, the feeling on his back of Philuffy's breasts that sometimes were touching his back with only a single towel separating them, it boiled Lux's brain in the blink of eye.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow……this is nostalgic."</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy muttered earnestly. Her voice sounded vaguely joyful.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like this originally reticent girl had become talkative before he realized it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-Phi-chan, today you are……unusually active aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux brought up a topic with a smile to distract his mind that was filled with excitement.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Philuffy's face got reflected on the mirror in front of him. Her face was slightly looking down.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………. That might be so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy's hands stopped moving for a moment‐then her face immediately lifted up with a shy look.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was staring on Lux's face through the mirror of the washing place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Surely, it's because I'm feeling happy, that Lu-chan is choosing me. Perhaps I'm feeling cheerful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy joined her hand on her chest and smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux‐saw it for the first time.</p>
<p class="null-p">This girl was poor at expressing her emotion‐but, she was strong-willed and wouldn't compromise.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was his childhood friend, a girl who he had known since a long time ago. But this was his first time seeing her making a face like that. "Because you told me, that you want to be together with me."</p>
<p class="null-p">*Gyut*, she hugged his back tightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her breasts smoothly slid from the bubbles on his back. Her warmth and scent and softness were melting Lux's rationality.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut/illustrations/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut_vol_20_9.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"Thank you, Lu-chan. I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's field of vision was dyed pure white.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phi, chan……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's feeling toward his childhood friend that had been hidden all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">It swelled up explosively.</p>
<p class="null-p">His consciousness was melting within the bath's steam.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that the two of them passed the time for a while inside the dim large bathroom.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 6</p>
<p class="null-p">"I feel, a bit dizzy."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Me too……really dizzy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly and nodded at Philuffy's muttering.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them slowly exhaled a flushed breathing while snuggling on each other. Right now they were sitting on their bedroom's sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Steam was still rising from their body that was clad in pure white bathrobe.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt strangely embarrassing, though it was different from before.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition, the pleasant feeling had increased even more than before with even more intimacy‐he was feeling a happiness that made him wanted to break out dancing.</p>
<p class="null-p">All this time, he had wanted to be joined together with Philuffy‐to become her lover. He understood that now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lu-chan will become king. It'll be hard for you from here."Yeah. But‐I'll do my best. Because this is what I wished for." Lux nodded back strongly at Philuffy's question.</p>
<p class="null-p">The impetus that made Lux planned a revolution when he was still an imperial prince.</p>
<p class="null-p">Overturning the custom of chauvinism and creating a country where Airi and Philuffy could leave peacefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">That dream was still continuing even now though in a different shape.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep. Let's do our best. With everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy smiled at him under the dim light of the lamp.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's dream didn't belong to just himself anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now‐he had companions who were supporting him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux knew that those bonds were the greatest thing that he obtained from the battles in this one year.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come to think of it"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux suddenly blurted out while his whole body was enveloped in lethargy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Phi-chan, is there anything that you want? That's, it will be your birthday</p>
<p class="null-p">soon‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy was staying close to Lux who was in a special position not because of a simple emotion of pity.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was telling him that it was simply because of her own feeling and will.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so‐Lux still wanted to show his feeling of gratitude to her, and so he naturally asked her that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy pondered that question with a blank face in puzzlement.</p>
<p class="null-p">A few seconds later, an answer that was really like her came back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing in particular but, if possible‐I want you to meet me at that time, I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">In short, anything would be fine if it was from Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐Lux was happy that Philuffy who usually didn't have anything that she wanted was telling him that she wanted Lux to come to meet her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, don't you have any other request? If it's something that I can do, then I want to do it‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Lux asked her again because he wanted to do something special for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to quickly meet, Lu-chan's baby."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said that calmly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy was telling him that with an earnestly affectionate smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's face instantly turned bright red from hearing that sentence.</p>
<p class="null-p">His head that was in a daze from the long bath was turning even dizzier.</p>
<p class="null-p">His consciousness was getting farther away with his feeling of love toward her and a feeling of euphoria enveloping him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next morning, they left Relie's inn and departed toward Cross Field.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was enjoying the comfort of his forever unchanging relationship with Philuffy that was advancing forward while staying unchanging, while flying under the azure sky toward the academy.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Episode 4 ‐ The Little Sister is Seeing a New Dream (Airi Chapter)</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">Going slightly back in time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Several days before Lux decided to temporarily become the king and took five queens.</p>
<p class="null-p">The aftermath of the battle against Fugil at the Ancient Forest was being cleaned up while talk was held about the successor of Queen Raffi. At that time‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was sleeping in the academy's medical office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn……. Uu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The decisive battle over Avalon where everyone united and challenged it together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was also participating in it but, after the battle was over and she recovered briefly‐her body's condition worsened again and she had to stay on bed. She was still unable to leave the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was also a female doctor who was constantly staying in the medical office, but fundamentally it was Noct who often attended on her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even now Noct was constantly accompanying and nursing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi, how are you feeling today?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll recover, by sleeping like this……. I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason she collapsed was the mental shock from how Lux ended up taking five wives‐wasn't the case. It was because of the recoil from using the Divine Drag-Ride Jormungandr in that decisive battle for a long period.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body couldn't move satisfactorily because of mental fatigue as well as muscle pain all over her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was also getting fever due to the side effect of continuously using DragRide.</p>
<p class="null-p">These several days, the time she was able to wake up was very little. She was relying completely to Noct to take care of her need.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really, it was really reckless of me even if I say so myself……"</p>
<p class="null-p">As a Drag-Knight, Airi's ability was extremely low except for her aptitude score, but in order to support Lux, he volunteered to participate in the battle against Fugil as a trump card.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looking from the result, her decision was correct.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without Airi there‐they would surely be unable to obtain victory.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the compensation for that was great.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she didn't even move for a step at that time because she was wearing an installation type Divine Drag-Ride, her stamina was considerably consumed just from wearing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">What could be said for now was that Airi would never wear Drag-Ride anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">She thought that stamina was unrelated with controlling Drag-Ride, but as expected basic physical ability was also indispensable for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that sense, she could understand how Celis could be called as the academy's strongest.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, she was fortunate enough that she still had all her limbs and there also wouldn't any permanent after-effect from this.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had actually fought that much, and she was satisfied that she was able to save Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, putting that aside, her days on the bed were extremely boring.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way Noct, what happened to Nii-san's……schedule?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a tough schedule but one that isn't overly so just as Airi wished for. There is no need to worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And his guard……. How is it going with that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It's also being done following Airi's thinking. The other Triad‐Sharis and Tillfur are at his side, also‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, it's fine. I too have to think about myself soon‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi let out a relieved sigh while muttering that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct changed the cold towel on Airi's forehead without being able to say anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">As her roommate, as her best friend, she had been watching Airi's action from her side all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was anxious even from Lux throwing himself into danger. So she recklessly joined the final battle to not let Lux died.</p>
<p class="null-p">But thanks to that Lux was starting to walk a new path as a king.</p>
<p class="null-p">He hadn't decided his plan after his term finished in one year and he graduated from the academy, but he wasn't wearing the criminal collar anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I too have obtained freedom……. Perhaps I should study more and work in the capital as a civil official."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi said that jokingly. Then she fell asleep from fatigue.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi had fought together with Lux in order to win their freedom.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi who was unable to pilot Drag-Ride skillfully studied the knowledge about the Ruins and displayed her ability as a civil official.</p>
<p class="null-p">The huge amount of debt that was placed on Lux couldn't possibly be cancelled other than becoming a hero who dealt with a world-scale danger like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, now that her objective had been achieved, it also meant losing her objective at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because when she was still branded a criminal, the only thing in Airi's mind was how to survive at the present together with Lux. Noct couldn't say anything because she knew that feeling of Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">The marriage of Lux and the queens would also be an auspicious event, but she must also feel lonely because her brother was taken away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, she didn't say anything in consideration of her brother's happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi‐you are a splendid person."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct muttered while staring at Airi sleeping.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If possible, I wish to be able to serve you and Lux-san till the end." Noct muttered that to her prideful friend before she left that place for a bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Airi saw a dream.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">Five years ago‐at a monastery in the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux and Airi reunited for the first time after the revolution.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi. Are you alright!? How is your body……? Have you eaten?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was still seeing in her dream of the time when she was reunited with Lux in an old lounge made from wood.</p>
<p class="null-p">The revolution succeeded‐no, the coup d'etat that became a success ended and three months had passed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux went to meet Airi who was staying in a monastery.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the emperor's death‐Lux received Queen Raffi's amnesty and avoided execution in exchange of being branded a criminal. He had been separated from Airi temporarily.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the surface, Lux was placed on his position as the chore prince to be the symbol of atoning for the sin of the old empire.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi who had sickly body was living a life of house arrest in the monastery.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was living as a hostage in essence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely this would continue for her whole life‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was hearing rumor in the monastery that perhaps if she was lucky, the criminal collar might be taken off from her just before she died.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was standing on the precipice of despair with her future tied by fate.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her big brother was allowed to meet her every few months and came here in panic for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to protect Airi, he had trained hard to pilot Drag-Ride even though he was still twelve years old‐, then not only he attempted a revolution, he even got branded as a criminal now. The heart of Airi who was in the monastery was pained from that.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Because of me‐. Nii-san went through something like that.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Not only he was burdened with debt for eternity as a criminal, he was also showed to the whole country to be humiliated as the chore prince.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even while her heart was hurting from that, Airi stifled down the pain of her powerlessness of being unable to help Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">She strongly wished to be able to meet with her brother more, but at the same time she also felt scared to meet him.</p>
<p class="null-p">What if Lux who became the chore prince met a horrible experience‐or what if he resented Airi who became a hostage.</p>
<p class="null-p">She thought that there was no way her kind brother would be like that, but the rumor around her was also cruel at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that anxiety of Airi was only a needless fear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her brother was giving her an affectionate smile with pure kindness that was no different from before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san yourself, please eat properly at least. You're worn out."</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, this is just‐I was still working just before coming here. I'm sorry that I come here with this kind of appearance."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was living in a far poorer environment compared to Airi at that time. Even so he wasn't showing her any fainthearted attitude at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was so that he wouldn't worry Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">She noticed that and felt that her tears were going to spill out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi had been sickly since she was a child. Then she lost her mother. Her position in the imperial family was at the bottom rung. Then after the revolution she got branded a criminal.</p>
<p class="null-p">For Airi who had been toyed by fate until now, Lux's existence was her only salvation within her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely, if she didn't have this brother, she would have died for real.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm doing good. Everyone is also treating me well‐. That's why Nii-san too, please treat your own body carefully."</p>
<p class="null-p">Facing Lux, Airi showed a graceful ladylike smile and poked on Lux's nose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll check on Nii-san's appearance and condition the next time we meet, so please pay attention to yourself so that you won't get talked down by me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……. I really can't go against Airi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly. In respond Airi spoke proudly at him.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut/illustrations/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut_vol_20_10.jpg">
<p class="null-p">At first she felt lonely and wanted to cry from anxiety, but then she felt that a hot fire was lit inside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually‐she wanted Lux to stay at her side.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to say her complaints to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐seeing her brother's figure made courage born inside her, telling her that she couldn't do something like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">(If it's for the sake of helping my precious big brother‐I swear I'll go through any hardship.)</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi became strong since that day.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her body also stopped being as sickly as before. She desperately strived to study even more than before, and she also worked hard to get along well with the people around her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometimes she also wanted to meet with Lux more and be together with him, but she didn't act spoiled and kept training herself to make Lux happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had fought all this time for his little sister Airi's sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">He risked his life and spent time to give her freedom.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, this was alright.</p>
<p class="null-p">From here on, she wanted Lux to prioritize his own happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was worried of the trouble he might get from having a lot of queens but‐it would surely be alright somehow if he was with those five.</p>
<p class="null-p">She thought that he could be troubled as much as possible with his woman relationships.</p>
<p class="null-p">It might be a bit mean of her but, Airi was unable to look after him until that far.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Airi intended to become of help for him after he became king no matter what if it was about other matter than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Please become happy. Not for my sake, but for NIi-san's own sake from here on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi said that while being half asleep and half awake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then before she realized it, her consciousness had completely fallen into darkness.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn……, nn"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi woke up and opened her eyes slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the usual morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">She still had some fever and her body was still languid like before, but she could feel that she was becoming better bit by bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I saw, a nostalgic dream……)</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no voice of female students coming from the school building. Airi noticed that today was a holiday.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition it seemed right now was time for breakfast. The aroma of food was flowing inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed the female doctor wasn't here because it was holiday, but it had been arranged that Noct would nurse her, so she wasn't worried.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was also fire at the fireplace to warm the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi felt relieved with her best friend's consideration while closing her eyes inside the medical office.</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while, the room's door opened with a clattering sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">A scent that stimulated the appetite was drifting along with the sound of a trolley being pushed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm feeling hungry. Let me eat quickly Noct. My body still can't move like I want it to so‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. I almost never used the kitchen here, so it was already late when I noticed it‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Airi said those words to act like a spoiled child toward Noct, the reply that was returned came back from a young man instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reality that was outside her expectation made Airi fell into thought for several seconds on her bed before she tried to jump on her feet.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐, her body was still heavy. She was unable to get up immediately with her strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she understood from the voice who was entering the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">She somehow mustered the strength of her whole body to put her hands on the bed and lifted her upper body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, she found Lux who was wearing uniform and a light pink apron above it preparing things to act as her waiter in Noct's place.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I heard that you will be fine to eat light food, so I made soup for you but, do you think you can eat it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"What are you doing Nii-san!? You should be still in the capital today right!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi flared at Lux even while doubting that perhaps this wasn't a reality but a dream.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the schedule that Airi knew, Lux should still be in the capital for inspection.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if his work finished earlier, it was impossible for him to have returned to the academy at the afternoon today.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that she remembered that his whole day‐would be a holiday after so long.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi……. You remember even my schedule even though you have collapsed like this, You don't need to force yourself like that, so forget about it right now and rest well."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Now see here, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi put her hand on her forehead and sighed in her pajama.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was doing my work properly you know? I finished earlier than scheduled and so I returned here, that's all. I flew with Drag-Ride for a bit, so I was able to return quicker."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, it's all the more reason that it's not the time to nurse me here right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, why?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux asked with a puzzled face. Airi felt dizzy seeing his reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though it was already difficult for her just to sit up on the bed like this, she fired up herself and argued.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As the next king, resting your body is also your job. This isn't the time for</p>
<p class="null-p">Nii-san to waste time looking after me! You even forced yourself like that"</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I heard that Airi still isn't well so"</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no need to worry. I'm energetic like this as you can see‐……uu"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi who was sitting down on the bed staggered from her fever.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux hurriedly held Airi's shoulders so that she wouldn't fall.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on, don't force yourself. Tomorrow is also a holiday, so I'll nurse you for these two days."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled brightly and whispered to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Noct, where has she gone to?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems that she has a business today and tomorrow, so it doesn't look like that she will be able to come here too much. She had also looked after Airi all this time, so it can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why do I have to be calmed down, haa, haa……. By Nii-san who is always doing reckless things-……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……. Rather than that, let's eat the food. It's freshly made, so eat it before it got cold."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly while preparing a cushion on the bed to support her back. It fixed Airi's sitting position in place.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, he scooped the soup with a spoon and blew on it fuu fuu to cool it before he brought it to Airi's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi opened her mouth like a baby bird receiving food from the parent bird. The moderately warm soup flowed into her throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">The content of the soup was consommé that was taken from red meat and vegetable.</p>
<p class="null-p">The faint taste of salt and the taste of melted vegetable were clearing up her hazy consciousness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, I'm not a child. So can Nii-san not blowing the soup fuu fuu like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi became embarrassed and her cheeks reddened not from heat while she stared fixedly on Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">But Lux paid it no mind and held the spoon just like before toward her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, she wouldn't be able to get out from this situation unless the meal was over.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, Airi helplessly accepted Lux's help.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time a freshly baked bread with herb and soaked into the soup entered her mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">Last she ate a grilled egg and drank milk. With that the meal was over.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was difficult for her to move her limbs, so Lux supported her shoulder and wiped her mouth. It was really embarrassing that Airi was writhing with red face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow, it feels nostalgic. It's like returning to our childhood."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tsu! I'll say this, I don't want to be looked after by Nii-san at this age okay!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha, sorry. I wasn't making fun of you."</p>
<p class="null-p">She was giving her all to show her reluctance, but Lux removed the tray with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, Noct in her uniform showed up to relieve Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, where……did you go, Noct!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I'm sorry. My job as Syvalles had been piling up a little, so I went for a bit to deal with them‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct replied with monotone tone. Airi flared up at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't mind you doing that, but why were you sending Nii-san here? He is busy with dealing with the official businesses, it's not the time to make him nurse me like this……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true, Airi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was pointing out like that, but Noct answered her smoothly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi is an important family for Lux-san. Lux-san has been holding back himself all this time from looking after you who collapsed in order to do his works."</p>
<p class="null-p">She heard that while the Triad were guarding him, it seemed he was worried about Airi all the time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, please let him nurse you obediently. If you really don't want that, Airi should ask Lux-san yourself to leave you alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The way you say that……. It's unfair."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi averted her gaze from Noct and sulked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san won't listen even if I tell him anyway, there is no way I'll be able to stop Nii-san……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was always proclaiming victory in the dispute between them but, she was aware that she actually didn't have any way to make Lux changed his thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux wouldn't compromise with his own will when it was important.</p>
<p class="null-p">He would accomplish his will no matter what kind of recklessness he had to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time was most likely something like that too.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Besides‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no way she wouldn't feel happy that Lux was thinking that much about her.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was also happy with how he intentionally took the little bit of free time that he had to nurse her personally.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her feeling toward Lux that she finally was just about to sever was welling up inside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Then, excuse me. I'll come to check on you sometimes, so please call me if there is something."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait……! Please wait! There is something that I want to ask you Noct‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct bowed and was about to leave, but Airi hurriedly stopped her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What is it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……. Toilet."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Please pardon me for my lack of consideration."</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected this was the only thing that she couldn't possibly ask her brother for help regardless of whether she was acting strong or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">However in the end it was decided that she would be nursed by Lux for two days, today and tomorrow.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">She became alone with Lux once more in the medical office that was reserved for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The hands of the clock were ticking away. The sound of crackling from the firewood in the fireplace silently filled the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm right here, so tell me if there is anything that you need."</p>
<p class="null-p">After going to toilet, she also asked Noct to help her changing her clothes. She was now receiving Lux's nursing in a new pajama.</p>
<p class="null-p">Regulating the temperature inside the room, changing the towel on Airi's forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, periodical help in changing her posture to prevent her from getting sore. Those were Lux's primary tasks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't really need any help. I just need to sleep, so Nii-san should take some rest yourself. Even though you haven't even taken any rest sufficiently since the battle was over."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……. I'm fine. My body has become tough from Baptism after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">What Airi pointed up seemed to hit a chord in Lux because he started making an excuse to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, time passed peacefully for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, how long are you planning to be like this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly such words slipped out from the lips of Airi who was lying on the bed while staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san won't be able to keep sparing your time just to look after me forever. After all you are going to become the king, and you will also marry five queens."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How long"‐she wasn't referring to him nursing her right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was referring to how long Lux would continue treating Airi specially like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eerr, I never thought about time limit like that at all though‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think Nii-san can be like that. I'll allow it this time but, Nii-san too will be in a complicated position after this, so you should have the selfawareness as the king."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Somehow, you don't seem like usual Airi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux made a troubled smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected he never thought that he would be lectured by the one he was nursing.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, this was also Airi drawing the line.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was to deal‐with her jealousy toward the girls who would walk the path as Lux's queens after this.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was necessary for her to come to term with her feeling of jealousy toward them for taking away Lux from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, Airi was intentionally trying to push Lux away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the last time Nii-san can treat me specially okay? I too will soon become an adult lady after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's tone was like a light chiding.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled with some loneliness in it hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though‐it was actually Airi who wanted to be together with Lux, she was pretending as though she was going along with Lux's selfishness reluctantly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wouldn't be able to keep going unless she drew a line in her heart like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she felt her chest tightened seeing Lux's pained face.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why after that Airi kept her gaze fixed on the wall while talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In exchange‐is it fine……that I have Nii-san spoiling me just for today and tomorrow?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It doesn't need to be just today and tomorrow you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's voice when answering her was bright and gentle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's chest ached hearing those words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will be just today and tomorrow. After that please concentrate to your duty. You can think about me just once in a while after that." After telling him that, their alone time continued.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so‐there wasn't anything that particularly changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi would sit up and read a book. Then she would sleep when tired.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was also sitting on a nearby sofa and reading the paperwork of his official business.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sometimes he would check on Airi and helped her changing her posture so that she wouldn't get sore, or changing the wet towel on her forehead.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airing the room, adjusting the fire's size at the fireplace.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time was passing slowly like that mostly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Several hours passed and Lux fed Airi once more for dinner. After it finished, he talked to Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come to think of it‐what are you going to do after this Airi?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll have to attend Nii-san's wedding five times. It'll be troublesome."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……No, not that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nii-san means about my future, I haven't really thought about it. Perhaps after graduating I'll work as civil official to manage the Ruins' legacy?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Because after this the world would be moving to suppress the working of the Ruins, the management of the ancient technology would have to be even more thorough. If not each country would seek power once more and got into dispute with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">And yet, letting go of the benefit that they had obtained until now was already impossible.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to thoroughly seal the function to produce Abyss and forbidding taking out a legacy in a level that was higher than the currently existing technology, a role to inspect that standard would become necessary.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that regard, Airi who had received Baptism and could also decipher ancient script had enough qualification for that.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would surely be highly prized for any organization that was related to Ruins.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see. The new kingdom have three Ruins, so I too will be happy if you can stay at my side."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not saying that I will work in new kingdom where Nii-san's eyes can reach though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was saying that with a heartwarming tone, but Airi told him with a fixed stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Lux hung his head down with a conflicted expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This time I fought in order to save Nii-san but, it's not like I will be needed here from here on, so Nii-san can just get heavily troubled by your relationships with five queens surrounding you." Airi spoke scathingly like that and smiled faintly.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the way she could draw the line right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct who occasionally came to check on them seemed to have somewhat guessed what happened between the two of them from the atmosphere, but she didn't say anything and helped Airi cleaning her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that, the first day of Lux's nursing came ot an end.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, Lux borrowed a wheelchair and a cane and brought them to Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi, do you want to try having a stroll within the academy if you think you can? You must be bored only lying down on the bed forever."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I think I have told Nii-san that you don't need to care for me though……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi gave him a fixed stared. In respond Lux smiled while scratching his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I have already borrowed them. So how about it seeing that I already brought them here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa……it can't be helped."</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact‐Airi's body had recovered to a degree where she could get up by herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she was planning to separate herself from her big brother by making use of this chance, why then Lux was the one taking the initiative to get involved with her?</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to reconfirm his intent.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux prepared muffler and lap blanket for the warmly dressed Airi, and also made her held a heated stone to warm her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi recalled the time when she was genuinely sickly at her childhood. Far from feeling nostalgic, she was feeling embarrassed instead.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't feel cold? Tell me right away if you feel tired. I'll carry you on my back to return quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san……. Although it's holiday, are you planning to make me be shamed within the academy's ground?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi was replying to Lux's genuine concern with exasperation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine. I'm going to be careful so that no one will see us."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Lux only pushed on her wheelchair with a terribly bright expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was pushing her wheelchair gently in consideration of Airi's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was nostalgic. It felt like she was returning to the past seven years ago. Airi immersed herself in her recollection.</p>
<p class="null-p">They alternately went to inside and outside of the academy while staring at the scenery and breathing the outside air.</p>
<p class="null-p">They stopped at the library to borrow books, visited the cafeteria to drink tea, relaxing at the courtyard while basking in the sun, frolicking with a stray cat.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the holiday alone with her big brother that Airi had wished for all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san, can I ask you one thing?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi suddenly began to talk when the sun was shining at the peak of the sky at the afternoon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux tilted his head in confusion. Airi turned around to look at him and told him with a serious face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why did Nii-san intentionally volunteered to nurse me this time?"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux showed a slightly surprised expression to that question.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, his expression immediately returned to his usual smile and he replied even though he seemed bewildered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because I heard that Noct is busy with other business this time. It also looked like that I would be able to return to the academy earlier this time so</p>
<p class="null-p">I‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're lying."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi pointed that out with an upward gaze without any hesitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have asked Noct herself about her schedule. She shouldn't have any work that would make her need to neglect her role of looking after me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-no……that's why perhaps, there was a sudden business or something‐. You know, the doctor is in holiday yesterday and also today, and it'll also feel awkward to ask other student to switch with her."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's gaze was wandering around while he was saying that.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that Airi saw through that he was lying without even needing to ask him directly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually, I was listening to Nii-san and Noct's conversation. Nii-san purposefully asked her to leave the role of nursing me to you‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, there is no way‐!? Airi should be sleeping at that time!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was surprised and asked reflexively. Right after that Airi turned a smile toward her brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was really something when getting into an exchange of tactic and plot against his opponent, but he was full of opening like usual when dealing with a comrade or family who he trusted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san fell for it. It's one hundred years to early for Nii-san to try to trick me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, uh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux awkwardly looked down. Airi turned her gaze back to the front and asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, let me ask one more time. Why is Nii-san intentionally asking to nurse me that you even lie about it? Even though you are busy and tired, you even stole Noct's work‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The question are increasing……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine, please answer me. The reason why Nii-san is doing something so incomprehensible‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi looked around once more and pressed her question with a fixed stare.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Lux hesitated for a while. Then before long he resolved himself and muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's, because I thought that being taken care by me would weigh on Airi's mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand what Nii-san mean……, what's with that reason. I'm talking based on a mature judgment. Why is Nii-san is even making excuse to do something like‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eerr. Because, I don't want Airi to refuse me‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi stiffened at Lux's awkward smile and words.</p>
<p class="null-p">That strong, heroic, and kind‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would never say it from her mouth but, she loved and trusted her big brother more than anyone else. Her thought stopped because that brother of hers confessed his reason with such despondent look.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Airi is always, being considerate of me. Perhaps, you would just chase me off if I asked normally to nurse you……. But‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux whispered with a fragile voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to be together with you after so long. I want to at least stay at Airi's side properly when you collapsed because you were forcing yourself for my sake. After all since I became the chore prince, since coming to the academy, I kept getting Airi to look after me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi couldn't say anything back.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi herself couldn't become Lux's strength as a Drag-Knight.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt jealous to Lisha and others, and even to the Triad who had been fighting beside Lux all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though she had finally become healthy, it vexed her that she couldn't become any help for her brother.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why‐she forced herself and even participated in the final battle wearing Divine Drag-Ride.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, she wanted to free Lux himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">She didn't want to tie up Lux to herself by needing him to look after her.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just what are you saying, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi made an exasperated smile and looked up at her brother's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's me. I'm the one who is saved by Nii-san, all the time until now I have been saved by Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Lux was there for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because there was someone who was treasuring her‐because she had a beloved family that she was able to do her best until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, if it was for the sake of a sibling who shared the same blood with her, she was able to force herself no matter how reckless.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end‐the two of them brother and sister were two similar people to a shocking degree.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, if Nii-san is seriously thinking that‐it looks like that you still need my help huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even without saying it out loud, the feeling that was weighing Airi down at the inside vanished the moment she realized they were able to connect with one another.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi chuckled and lifted up her right arm that still felt somewhat languid to poke at her brother's cheek.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……. Yeah‐I'll be greatly helped if you do that for me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'll have Nii-san take care of me thoroughly today. After all I ended up like this because of going along with Nii-san's recklessness."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi said that mischievously. Lux smiled at her with a troubled look.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, the two of them enjoyed a holiday of just them siblings without anyone else interrupting them.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 6</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry. About the bath today, I got an urgent business and won't be able to return. It will be until late at night, so I'll leave it to Lux-san to take care of Airi."</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing dinner and returning to the medical office, the siblings saw the note that was left behind and froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">This wasn't Noct being considerate in a strange way, it seemed she was really dispatched to solve a trouble of collapsing building that happened in Cross Field.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-well……. It can't be helped. Should we wait until Noct return?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux suggested in slight bewilderment, but Airi shook her head slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is naïve. Noct would properly write it if there is possibility that she will be able to return back in time. Are you planning to make me sleep in this state?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's cheeks reddened slightly in shame while she pleaded with an upward gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although Airi's body had recovered more than yesterday, she was still not in the state of being able to easily change her clothes by herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be difficult for her to change her clothes by herself, and it would also take a lot of effort for her to wipe her body using wet towel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's, I'm, alright with it but……. Is Airi alright with it?"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end Airi would need to show her almost naked appearance to him, so Lux fearfully asked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-there is no way I'm alright with it right? Does Nii-san wish to see your little sister naked at this age? Please blindfold your eyes. I will‐direct Niisan how to do it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah. I got it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was relieved by what Airi pointed out and he started making preparation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The dorm mother was the one doing the laundry, so the set of clothes for changing had been left by Noct beside the pillow.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Looks like, there is also underwear……)</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only natural that there was underwear but, if he pointed it out to Airi it felt like she would look strangely at him again, so Lux began without saying anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">He covered his eyes with a thick towel and Lux's sight was covered in darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, what should I do‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">In the past Lux had also helped the sickly Airi to change clothes, but doing it now was making him nervous in various senses.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was sitting face to face with Airi on the bed. His hands reached forward and unbuttoned her pajama's buttons one by one.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Somehow, it feels like the atmosphere is getting even stranger because of the blindfold……)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was taking off Airi's pajama while a strange atmosphere of embarrassment and tension was drifting.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, now is the back. Undo the hook‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, I'm taking off even the underwear too!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't say it out loud even though I've been intentionally keeping quiet about it! I'm not making Nii-san doing it because I like it……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-sorry……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux apologized to the shouting Airi while his hands moved toward Airi's underwear.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was obvious but, Lux's heart was strangely beating fast because he was also touching her bare skin.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nh……"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was Airi's voice that sounded similar with a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">That voice echoed inside the quiet medical office at night and colored the atmosphere alluringly.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Lux took a deep breath to endeavor to calm his heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Calm down, just what am I thinking……! I'm only nursing her like in the past, I'm not doing anything‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux chased out his idle thoughts from his consciousness and wiped Airi's sweaty skin with a towel that was already soaked in hot water.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the middle, Lux's hand felt the sensation of something small and soft over the towel.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Kyah……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what's the matter Airi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was surprised hearing the sudden shrilly voice. He wondered if there was any trouble.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it's nothing. Nii-san's hand……touch a little‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's voice at the latter half was small so he couldn't hear what he said, but it seemed nothing particular had happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">(But, is it alright to continue like this, really!? It feels like I'm doing something that shouldn't be done as a person‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">Couldn't he ask other girl who was staying behind in the academy at least just for helping Airi changed clothes?</p>
<p class="null-p">However it also felt it was already too late to do that after coming this far.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tsu, p-please continue it, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Airi was enduring the shame.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux resolved himself like that. It was at that timing, *rattle* the door of the medical office opened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux couldn't see with his blindfold, but he could hear Noct's monotone voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I have knocked just now but, I suddenly recalled something urgent so please excuse me."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux couldn't see with his eyes, but Airi could clearly see her best friend closing the opened door with a blank face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-!? Wait! Don't go!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-that's right Noct! If you have returned then please switch place with me!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux and Airi desperately stopped Noct.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, the role of wiping Airi's body and changing her clothes was handed over to her.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 7</p>
<p class="null-p">While Lux was waiting outside for the moment, Airi and Noct were talking alone inside the medical office.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How was it Airi? Were things going well with Lux-san while I wasn't here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing happened. I only had Nii-san taking care of me normally."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. That's great. If you are able to become honest with yourself, then it's worth it for me to remove myself like that. Ah, but what happened at the end there was really unexpected."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct said that while smiling and putting a blanket over Airi on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haa, I'm really happy to have a best friend who thought of her friend like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct must have noticed the subtleties and conflict in Airi's heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had obtained freedom with the collar of criminal taken off from him, and he began to walk a new path as the king of the new kingdom.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was also going to marry five queens. With that Airi was feeling that she had lost her objective and place to belong.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi had no need to become Lux's strength anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, she intended to leave him so that she wouldn't hinder her brother's action.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐that was wrong.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are magnificent. You controlled that Jormungandr with a body that isn't used to pilot Drag-Ride, and supported Lux-san until the very end. No, even before that you have become Lux-san's strength until now from the shadow. More than anyone else‐from a place nearest than anyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">The usually taciturn Noct was talking unusually talkative.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore Airi wasn't the only one who had such feeling. Lux was also feeling the same.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, in order to make the two of them realized each other's feeling, Noct played a trick by entrusting Lux to look after Airi.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux-san will be taken away after this so I think that Airi will also have it hard but, you are without a doubt loved by him. Please at least keep that in mind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I don't have any intention to say anything about Nii-san's love life from the start though."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi slightly averted her gaze and pouted at what Noct pointed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond her best friend nodded with a faint smile on her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll believe you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, do so. Also‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi stared at Noct's face and told her while lying down on the bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please show me Nii-san's schedule after this. Now I know what I want to do next."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I'll bring it for sure tomorrow. I'll leave it to Lux-san to continue taking care of Airi until then."</p>
<p class="null-p">After that Noct left. Then Lux returned again.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before she slept, Lux finished adjusting the fireplace's temperature and ventilating the room. Then he tidied her bedding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'll stay here, so rest well without worry."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Good night, Nii-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux moved the sofa to right beside Airi's bed and covered himself with a blanket there.</p>
<p class="null-p">With the small flame of the fireplace faintly lighting the place, Airi was starting to fall sleep‐then Lux too had closed his eyes before he realized it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought it would be like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi slowly sat up on her bed while whispering with a small voice so that her brother wouldn't wake up.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, she stared at the sleeping face of her brother who was peacefully sleeping beside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is because Nii-san is showing sense of responsibility at strange place even though you are the one who is the most tired."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux wanted to personally take care of Airi who collapsed because she was forcing herself for his sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was nothing wrong with that feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, it seemed he had been forcing himself unconsciously.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really‐what a troublesome brother."</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a smile on Airi's face when muttering that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nothing had changed from when he visited Airi at that monastery.</p>
<p class="null-p">Whether he was a criminal or a king, there were things that hadn't changed from him.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then surely, Airi's own feeling toward Lux was also still the same like in the past all this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Nii-san show an opening like that, someone might get the jump on you, you know? Like by a bad little sister for example‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi whose cheeks were dyed crimson whispered to Lux mischievously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was completely exhausted and showed no sign of waking up. She leaned closer to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since this morning, although she couldn't move normally, she had become able to move quite much.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, this was a rare chance so she allowed her brother to spoil her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Airi herself also wanted Lux to spoil her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you. ‐My number one Nii-san in the world."</p>
<p class="null-p">The shadows of Lux and Airi from the fireplace's fire, their face overlapped right after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Nobody noticed that secret act and the night silently grew late.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 8</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san. Please wake up quickly. It's already morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N, nn……. Fuaaa. Wait, Airi!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, when Lux woke up Airi had already changed into her uniform and sitting on the wheelchair.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed she had rapidly recovered in these two days.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct had arrived while Lux was still sleeping. Airi was able to at least dress herself with Noct's help.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Today Nii-san is going to have a discussion with the mayor of Cross Field about the garrison of the Ruin and the security situation there. Of course Lord Dist and Celis-senpai will also be present there."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's back was straight even while sitting on the wheelchair. She was listing out his schedule straightforwardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux couldn't hide his confusion at her attitude that was completely different from yesterday.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, is your body alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just as Nii-san can see, there won't be any problem with my daily life if I take some breaks in between. Rather than that, please pull yourself together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because I'll manage Nii-san's schedule."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeeeh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was astounded. Airi continued in respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What? Nii-san doesn't like that? Nii-san who is forcing yourself even when you are dead tired is opposing my opinion?"</p>
<p class="null-p">*Glare* Airi stared at Lux with a fixed gaze that was hiding an implication.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that, Lux became unable to object at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, first please wash your face and dress yourself. I'll tell the Triad of when to depart. Please listen to Noct's instruction okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, yeah……. I'll do that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux nodded. He was accepting it even while looking bewildered.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 9</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi sighed in relieve after Lux left the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before Airi was insinuating that he was going to take some distance from Lux. But now she was becoming even more proactive than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct who was realizing that asked her best friend.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you found what do you want to do next now that you aren't a criminal anymore?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. As I thought I'm really worried for Nii-san that I can't just leave him alone."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi proudly answered and chuckled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression was saying that she was going to support Lux just like before, ‐no, even more than before from here on too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct guessed Airi's feeling and her lips loosened slightly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's good. It'll be worth it for me too to be in your service. By the way Airi‐you were alone with Lux-san last night but, there wasn't any misconduct that happened at that time right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What could you be talking about? Everything was normal last night." Airi said that while averting her gaze from Noct.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even siblings will have skinship with each other at least sometimes. Please don't make any strange misunderstanding."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I have a hunch that this require special caution."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm telling you, how can you make such misunderstanding right after I said that!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi flared up at her. In respond Noct easily ignored her with her blank expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi who wasn't branded a criminal anymore and obtained her freedom had found her next objective and starting to walk toward it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Under the azure sky of winter, the sunlight that was giving the sign of spring's arrival was shining on them.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Episode 5 ‐ The Servant is Going to Become a New Kingdom's Queen? (Yoruka Chapter)</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">After winning the final battle against Fugil and having a discussion with Lisha and Lord Dist, it was decided that Lux would become the king‐one month was remaining until that matter was announced at the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">This decision had been announced internally to the important people and Lux were also traveling everywhere to put in an appearance officially inside and outside the country. It was in the middle of that Lux was raising his voice at the courtyard of the academy late at night.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoruka, you are there aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no reply even when he threw that question.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Lux was feeling a slight presence within the peaceful night atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">The final battle had ended and Lux accepted Krulcifer's suggestion to be engaged with everyone. After that‐Yoruka stopped showing herself for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that she was at least showing herself in the academy occasionally but, whether it was because of a coincidence or intentional, Lux had no chance at all to see her figure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux himself had no free time because of his official duty and going out with the other girls, and he had an idea about the reason of Yoruka's action. Because of that he intentionally didn't search for her but‐finally he was trying to check on Yoruka at this moment. And so, he tried calling for her but,</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected, is she going somewhere else?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Do you have a business with me? ‐Aruji-sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Uwah!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux shot up when a voice suddenly called at him from behind.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who was clad in unique black outfit was kneeling to him with a bewitching smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was shocked and froze for several seconds, then he spoke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say. About recently‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be, you were tailing me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">One of the reasons Lux asked that was because he didn't catch sight of Yoruka at all for these ten days.</p>
<p class="null-p">The other reason was because, it was only sometimes but, he was feeling the presence of someone who seemed to be monitoring him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely, Lux wouldn't notice it if it was the past him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the strengthening operation that familiarized his body with Elixir‐Baptism that he received in the fight against the Lords, his body was strengthened and his five senses became sharper.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, although he couldn't describe it clearly, he became able to sense the slight presence that he was unable to sense before this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, I have never done such impolite act toward Aruji-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"E-eh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Lux was bewildered when Yoruka answered him like that with her carefree smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed it was just his imagination.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I was, confident of that though……. Have I become too highly strung……)</p>
<p class="null-p">He had become the next king, no‐, it hadn't been formally announced to the people but, even without that status, he was undoubtedly someone in the position that was deeply related to the Ruins.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was it that awareness that was making Lux's wariness to feel something that actually didn't exist?</p>
<p class="null-p">(Wait, then, if that presence until now didn't belong to Yoruka‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a possibility that someone else was observing Lux from afar.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's expression tensed from thinking that. But right at that moment,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was simply watching over Aruji-sama because of my worry for Arujisama's safety. It's upsetting to call that as tailing."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka told him that with a wide smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression was saying that she genuinely didn't hold a shred of doubt about her action at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He was right.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so, as expected from Aruji-sama. Aruji-sama sensed me even though I was sneaking in a way so that no one will notice me‐. I too still need to be diligent with my training."</p>
<p class="null-p">When he asked her further, it seemed the Triad and Airi also knew about Yoruka's covert action.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather‐after the final battle with Fugil, the four of them including Airi had discussed about how to guard Lux and made the decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was their decision that wasn't told to Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Triad was in charge of "the outward appearance of the guard".</p>
<p class="null-p">While Yoruka would secretly monitor Lux's surrounding from the shadow.</p>
<p class="null-p">Only very few people knew about Yoruka's existence and strength even in the whole world. Because of that if there was new enemy targeting Lux, they would misunderstand that Lux only had the Triad guarding him.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the enemy tried to slip through the security while thinking that‐Yoruka would bring them down from where she was hiding.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that Lux's security had two such layers.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even Lux wasn't being told about this strategy because he would surely feel a sense of relieve when he was aware of it, so they kept it a secret until Lux realized it himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I beg Aruji-sama for your forgiveness. This too is in consideration of Arujisama's safety."</p>
<p class="null-p">"So that's how it is. No, if that's the case then that's fine but……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The puzzle that he felt until now had been solved but, the reason Lux called for Yoruka this time wasn't because of that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, his actual objective was something else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have you thought about our talk before?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka fell silent with her smile still affixed on her face.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was unable to lie or mislead Lux as his loyal servant.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be, you are feeling troubled?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's not true. Is this about‐performing the wedding ceremony with Aruji-sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She remembered.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or rather, since then he didn't meet with Yoruka properly at all, so perhaps it was only natural in a sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yes‐that day when Krulcifer suggested he married with the five, the other four accepted it almost immediately.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Yoruka alone was different. Although she wasn't refusing, she was leaving the matter to be carried out completely by Lux's will. She didn't say anything about her wish of when and how the marriage would be carried out specifically.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so they came to now.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to formally announce Lux's marriage with the five queens in the future, he had to decide on the arrangements with Yoruka herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">The three days of parade that were looped due to Uroboros's Divine Raiment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux also became together with Yoruka within those loops just like with the other girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was a princess in her homeland. She didn't possess human heart since she was little and she was feared as someone inhuman there, even so the feeling of love toward Lux had sprouted within her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux wanted her to stay at his side not as a tool, but as a single human. That wish‐feeling of Lux was answered by her and they exchanged feeling with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">That night Lux and Yoruka had certainly become a pairing at that night. That should be the case.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Could it be‐that Yoruka's feeling, has changed?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux hesitantly the question that was weighing his mind.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Hyuu*. The night wind of winter blew and brought a small silence to the empty courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only reason that he could think of was just that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka was wishing to be joined together with Lux, but then she wouldn't show herself in front of him since that suggestion. The reason why that could be was‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps it wasn't just because of her mission to guard him, but because Yoruka's feeling toward Lux had changed.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Badump badump*, Lux was waiting with his heart pounding but‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's‐not the case."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka answered like that without any hesitation with her usual carefree smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My feeling hasn't changed, I dearly love Aruji-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't feel her lying or hiding something from her expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt relieved at the inside while asking her further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, why‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's inexcusable to me for saying this to Aruji-sama but, actually, I'm not inclined to be a queen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was perplexed by her reason that was contradicting her words just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Yoruka immediately gave him the answer.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll happily accept if it's to become Aruji-sama's mistress or conubine but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eerr, what do you mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was bewildered at Yoruka who was telling him that with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't understand what she meant even after pondering it deeply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aruji-sama will need me as your dagger from here on. I won't be able to accomplish that task if I'm to be treated as a queen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……By that, you don't mean"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux noticed after thinking for a while.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason why after Krulcifer's suggestion, Yoruka agreed only with the engagement while not responding to the matter of becoming queen.</p>
<p class="null-p">The answer to that was connected to her role as Lux's bodyguard that made her hid herself until just now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Aruji-sama ascended to become the king and welcome numerous queens, your life will surely be targeted by both internal and external forces. Me becoming one of Aruji-sama's queens will make me unable to fulfill my mission to clear away the danger to Aruji-sama well enough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Such thing‐……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was unable to assert that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Any people in important position was always accompanied with the risk of having their life targeted.</p>
<p class="null-p">Especially the more he married with other important people, the higher the risk would jump up.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was what it meant to be standing on a position that was involving great interests, regardless whether one was good or evil.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux knew that very well from the childhood that he spent as the youngest son of the emperor.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, he was unable to deny Yoruka's claim.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Besides‐Aruji-sama's enemy will increase from now on. Aruji-sama will also need someone to eliminate them. It will be troublesome if I'm standing on the front stage when such time come."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Erasing the adversary.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the destruction of her homeland the country of Koto, Yoruka lived as an assassin of Arcadia Empire. That was why she had this way of thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">He understood Yoruka's thinking to a painful degree. He also understood that her judgment was correct in a sense.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then Yoruka, for my sake‐you are going to walk the path of shadow, is that what you are saying?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux stared at her beautiful eyes that had two different colors and asked her. In respond Yoruka also stared back straight into Lux's eyes and answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's simply that this way is easier for me to accomplish my long-cherished desire. That's why, it's not something that Aruji-sama need to worry yourself sick about."</p>
<p class="null-p">From Yoruka's expression, this must be her true feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place Yoruka didn't have any fixation toward title or fame.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, she would loyally fulfill what she should do. Accomplishing her mission as a tool was what she lived for.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why not being chosen as queen would be more convenient for Yoruka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐I"</p>
<p class="null-p">However, Lux didn't want that for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want Yoruka to formally become one of my queens."</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely her attitude and what she did wouldn't change even if she was placed in the position of mistress or concubine.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her relationship with Lux also wouldn't change.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so‐there was a need to do it like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why is that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka unusually showed a puzzled expression and tilted her head.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Lux intentionally didn't give her any logical explanation and spoke impulsively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I‐want it like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I want to accept you formally as my queen. Because I don't want you to be a shadow protecting me, I want you to stay at my side in a different shape‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he had to force himself to give a logical reason, it was because he didn't want to put Yoruka in a position where she was constantly at danger to be cut down.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had confessed his love to her just like with the other girls who he would marry. And so Lux was unable to place her in the shadow alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Yoruka herself didn't wish for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like the position of mistress or concubine better though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even so please. I want you to become my queen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not good with royal court livelihood. Aruji-sama also know that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You don't need to act that stiffly after marrying me. I'll also help out with that so‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't be able to fulfill my mission to protect Aruji-sama if my movement is put under the surveillance inside the palace as a queen."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine for you to not do that anymore."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux strongly asserted after exchanging several sentences like this.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If you are going to protect me, it'll be enough if you do it from the position as my queen from now on. You don't need to do any more than that. That's‐my wish."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka too wouldn't be able to act recklessly if she was placed under the sun.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, he had the wish for her to live like that from now on.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was so that she wouldn't do something like challenging Singlen with the resolve to die for Lux's sake again.</p>
<p class="null-p">So that she wouldn't be able to do something that would make her got cut down ahead of everyone else.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐I will lose my reason to live if I become unable to protect Aruji-sama because of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka objected with a chuckle that contained a hidden meaning in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why please forgive me but, I can't possibly answer Aruji-sama's expectation to me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even if it's my order?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. This too is for Aruji-sama's sake."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's expression loosened seeing Yoruka's bright smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because even though her words were refusing him, that was the expression of Yoruka's emotion.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wasn't a tool who simply carried out everything she was ordered to without question.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka was already worrying about Lux's welfare with her own will and in her own way.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was‐Yoruka directing her feeling toward Lux as a human. It made him really happy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I do so that you will listen to my wish?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so Lux didn't yeild and attempted to persuade her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's see. If Aruji-sama is not someone who other people will target, then I too will accompany Aruji-sama as simply a person."</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Yoruka also didn't yield.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux being liberated from a position where he wouldn't be targeted wouldn't happen for now‐no, perhaps for his whole life.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just being involved deeply with the Ruins already placed an unavoidable fate over him.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why most likely it was impossible for him to overturn her decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">If‐it was other people than the current Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then Yoruka, you're saying that you won't have any problem becoming my queen if there is no need to protect me till such degree?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Here Lux changed the direction of the talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does that mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka tilted her head. Lux walked toward her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Actually‐during my inspection recently, it wasn't impossible for me to sense Yoruka's existence."</p>
<p class="null-p">He told Yoruka full of confidence while looking straight into her eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks to Baptism, my five senses has been sharpened even more than before. By the way Yoruka, you have never met someone who can hide their presence better than you before, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"As far as I know, there is none but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, I won't get assassinated that easily. Even if a master assassin at Yoruka's level come to take my head, I'll be able to protect myself."</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, Lux was pointing out that there wasn't that much need for Yoruka to stick to the "shadow" so thoroughly like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that Yoruka too had comprehended the meaning and intention from Lux's words but‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't understand. Is the position of queen really that important for Arujisama? I think that there won't be anything particular that change even if Aruji-sama manage to forcefully persuade me though?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka had perceived Lux's intention and replied to him with a soft expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, this is just my own will. I want things to be like that. I want Yoruka to also live in that kind of position. I want you to share things with me, with everyone while standing in the same position."</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want her to stay in the shadow while taking all the dangerous works alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">He also didn't want to treat her as a convenient tool.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if Yoruka herself wished for that, it wasn't the case with Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aruji-sama, you are really, similar with my little brother‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka smiled captivatingly and placed her hand over her Sword Device on her waist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it's exactly because of that, I can't allow Aruji-sama to repeat the same mistake."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her little brother was killed in the past. She couldn't allow Lux to arrive to the same destiny.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her purple mystic eye shined. Yoruka gave Lux an invitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What should I do so that I can reassure you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"The wind tonight is nice."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka suddenly averted her gaze and looked up to the night sky that was illuminated by the radiant moon.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Let's continue our conversation over there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka turned her back toward Lux with a sweet whisper and she started walking.</p>
<p class="null-p">She led Lux to the training ground within the academy.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please make me follow Aruji-sama's will. If Aruji-sama can win "two matches" against this me‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka said that and unsheathed her Sword Device from its sheath and equipped Divine Drag-Ride Yato no Kami.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Lux also silently unsheathed Bahamut's Sword Device from its sheath.</p>
<p class="null-p">After confirming that they each had equipped their Drag-Ride, they silently took some distance and took their stance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since the final battle against Fugil‐it had been one month since Lux had worn Bahamut to fight a battle. No, he hadn't even fought any battle at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">The movement of Yato no Kami that Yoruka was piloting was silent.</p>
<p class="null-p">It didn't show any preliminary movement and closed the distance with sliding movement of feet that was hard to perceive.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The first match is this battle of Drag-Ride. As for the other match, I shall tell Aruji-asma after this battle is over."</p>
<p class="null-p">(Yoruka, is she serious‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">This was a test that she herself proposed to Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">First was a battle using Drag-Ride.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't intend to lie when saying that he would protect himself even without borrowing her strength but‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">He realized his own naivety now that he was confronting Yoruka now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux didn't have the resolve to fight someone whose skill rivaled him like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without realizing it he had been relaxing after defeating powerful enemies in a row and obtaining a lot of powerful comrades.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I see, in order to tell me that‐Yoruka is)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux noticed that fact while facing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He could see her aim.</p>
<p class="null-p">Using her purple mystic eye that came from the Baptism performed on her, she could read the opening in Lux's consciousness and unleashed her special move‐Instant Strike.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Lux hit even just by a single hit and flinched, the movement of his DragRide would be stolen by the Divine Raiment Spell Code.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would be over if he got hit by the first strike that Yoruka launched.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition it was an attack that was impossible to dodge because it took advantage of his subconscious opening.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, that subconscious opening only lasted for an instant. In other words‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">(As long as I maintain a certain distance and doesn't let her enter the range‐, I'll be able to block Yoruka's Instant Strike.)</p>
<p class="null-p">It took a little bit of time for Yoruka to read Lux's breathing and slashed at him between the gap of his consciousness. Lux would be able to regain his consciousness and defend if there was some distance between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">In short‐he needed to keep the distance and win.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Here I go! Yoruka!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please do, Aruji-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux raised his voice and threw a dagger to keep Yoruka's movement in check.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally the dagger got deflected by the katana type Blade that Yato no Kami held.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux too didn't expect it to hit.</p>
<p class="null-p">If he threw it from distance toward Yoruka, it would take time for the weapon to reach her and it could be easily blocked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That feels lacking. Allow me to get closer to Aruji-sama's side for a bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">The number of Dagger that Lux had right now was only six, but he used Linker Pulse to pick the Dagger that fell on the ground and threw it once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition he also used Howling Howl to hit and run repeatedly.</p>
<p class="null-p">The gap between his consciousness wouldn't be taken advantage of while Yoruka was in the defensive.</p>
<p class="null-p">He would slash only for an instant at Yoruka before separating himself from her to avoid Spell Code's interference.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that Lux was able to maintain the distance somehow.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu……"</p>
<p class="null-p">But Yoruka was sporting a bewitching smile despite the situation that was sealing her Instant Strike.</p>
<p class="null-p">She must have seen through Lux's aim during this brief exchange of offense and defense.</p>
<p class="null-p">(No good……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Just now he thought that he would be able to block Instant Strike as long as he didn't enter Yoruka's range while she was on standby.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, in the end that was only a theoretical guess.</p>
<p class="null-p">Absurd stamina and focus were required to continue fighting a fighter of Yoruka's level while constantly avoiding Yato no Kami's range.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of that, his attack unavoidably became passive and he was unable to deal a decisive damage.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, even Yoruka shouldn't have much leeway here.</p>
<p class="null-p">If she constantly focused on using her purple mystic eye to read the wavelength of Lux's consciousness, her increase of fatigue would also be sped up proportionally.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐Yoruka right now was intentionally narrowing down her strategy to landing her Instant Strike.</p>
<p class="null-p">She should be able to fight equally with Lux by exerting all her swordsmanship skill but‐, she was challenging Lux with her forte in order to obtain victory with certainty.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a sense, this was a competition between their respective stubbornness.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because Yoruka wanted to protect Lux who she loved‐she was planning to turn herself into a useful tool.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if she couldn't stay at his side as his queen, it was several times better than allowing Lux to be exposed to danger.</p>
<p class="null-p">On the other hand, Lux had the opposite thinking.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want to treat Yoruka as tool.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because even if it was Yoruka's own wish to become a tool, once he allowed that, Lux too‐would become no different from the old empire that was treating Yoruka based on their own convenience.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because allowing that would mean that he was fine living by sacrificing her.</p>
<p class="null-p">(I know that this is a naïve thinking. But‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">Challenging that battle ahead and accomplishing it was to be Lux's task from now on, his purpose of living.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to take responsibility for the bond, the memory that sprouted during those three days of parade, he resolved himself to defeat Yoruka.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aruji-sama's consideration‐makes me very happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka took a stance of holding Yato no Kami's Blade beside her waist.</p>
<p class="null-p">The situation where both sides were at an equal standoff was gradually reducing the distance between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I too have something that I cannot concede."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka's wish was to protect Lux to the end even if she had to sacrifice herself for it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka believed that would be happiness for her. However‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoruka‐……tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The instant Lux muttered in concert with her, Yoruka's figure vanished from his sight.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's thought halted for several instant when faced with such incomprehensible situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, using the power of thought acceleration that he obtained from Baptism, he comprehended what had just happened a second later.</p>
<p class="null-p">(This is‐Instant Strike!? But, the way it's used is different from before…… a new technique!)</p>
<p class="null-p">The original Instant Strike was a technique to see through the instant where the opponent's consciousness was cut off and slashed the enemy who was in such defenseless state.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, it couldn't be used to an opponent who was located in a distance that couldn't be traversed with one leap.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why right now Lux was in a state that wouldn't be hit by Instant Strike at the very least.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">(She used the Instant Strike skill as a technique to remove herself from sight……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka saw through the instant Lux's consciousness was cut off and moved to his blind spot, then she activated the camouflage function of special equipment type Drag-Ride and erased her figure.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was she at left, right, behind, or perhaps above?</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux used one more second to focus his mind to consider every possibility, but the next moment a sound burst from the empty air in front of him where there was nothing.</p>
<p class="null-p">*DON!* The ground exploded and Yoruka who was hiding at the front rushed toward Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">She aimed at the gap of his consciousness to disappear and hide. After that aiming at the time when Lux didn't move at all in order to find the danger and dodge it‐at that second lapse of consciousness, she assaulted him violently with the special equipment type's Step.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is‐Instant Shadow. There is a way to slash even from outside the range you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She used the first opening to hide herself and closed the distance, then the second opening to slash.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was struck with admiration at the bottomless strength of Yoruka's genius in battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was taken by surprise and placed on his back foot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had fallen into a situation where dodging or parrying were both impossible to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">*GIIIINN!*</p>
<p class="null-p">He was just barely able to block the attack with Bahamut's great sword, but at that time the swords of both sides had already connected deeply.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is the end, Aruji-sama‐Spell Code."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka smiled gracefully and activated her Divine Raiment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux who was completely put on his back foot couldn't switch to counterattack.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then Yato no Kami's Divine Raiment was poured through the locked sword and stole the control of Lux's Bahamut‐was what should happen, but.</p>
<p class="null-p">*PAKIII-……!*</p>
<p class="null-p">"……-!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Right after that, the huge katana type Blade that Yato no Kami swung snapped into two.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Yoruka's point of contact with Lux's great sword vanished, Lux immediately swung the sword that he was using for defense.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Quick Draw"</p>
<p class="null-p">The barrier of Yoruka's Yato no Kami was cut apart and the great sword's tip grazed the shoulder armor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yato no Kami that received an impact on its Force Core was dispelled and Yoruka's flesh body in her black clothes was exposed under the moonlit sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Goshujin-sama is also a bad person. It was a trap wasn't it‐right from the start."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I thought that's the only way to win against your Instant Strike‐" Lux replied to Yoruka's fearless smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">From the start Lux didn't believe that he could take the initiative when the opponent was Yoruka.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was fighting by focusing energy to his Blade with the intent to sever Yoruka's Blade using Critical Hit as counterattack.</p>
<p class="null-p">This match itself was something that Yoruka proposed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, Yoruka herself should take the initiative to show her answer to Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Lux's victory for being able to read until that far.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, the technique just now was unexpected. I was only able to block it by chance."</p>
<p class="null-p">He wasn't being modest but saying his honest thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a battle that he could barely win because Yoruka was showing a tactic of aiming to win using only Instant Strike.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If I slacken‐no, even the enemies who still haven't showed themselves are evolving without us knowing about it. Yoruka wanted to tell me that, right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux dispelled Bahamut and held out his hand toward Yoruka to help her stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the next moment Lux felt a sense of discomfort.</p>
<p class="null-p">His back was feeling the cold texture of the ground.</p>
<p class="null-p">He should be looking down on Yoruka, but he was now looking up to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux noticed that their position had been reversed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoruka……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"My apologies. I mentioned that I would tell about the second match after this battle is over‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's eyes that widened in surprise caught the girl's bewitching smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">The second match.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a surprise attack in a situation where he wasn't wearing Drag-Ride.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka was straddling Lux with her Sword Device's tip pointed at his throat.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that point‐, the match had been decided.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The second match……is, my lost."</p>
<p class="null-p">Fuu……Lux let out a sigh and raised his hands.</p>
<p class="null-p">It became a declaration of surrender and Yoruka sheathed her Sword Device on her waist.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I thought, it looks like it's still too early for me to be able to win against Yoruka."</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, the content of this second match wasn't completely outside Lux's expectation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Certainly his basic training of unarmed fighting had been reduced because he was busy with his duty, but even if he had kept up with his training, surely he still would be unable to dodge Yoruka's attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">"One win and one loss, it's a draw. Then‐I won't be able to go along with Aruji-sama's intention."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a draw and so it was considered Lux's loss.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka's tone contained a vague hint of happiness in it from being able to achieve her objective, but there was also loneliness contained in it.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Lux got up so that his body wouldn't get cold and they returned to the academy.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">Late at night in the academy's drawing room.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had wiped his sweat, changed clothes, and confirmed that there wasn't any injury on his body. He was sitting face to face with Yoruka on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Almost all of the female students had returned to the girl dormitory and there wasn't any sign of people in the school building.</p>
<p class="null-p">They sipped hot tea to warm their body while having an evaluation meeting about the secret battle they just had.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐as expected from Aruji-sama. You saw through my Instant Shadow and blocked it. Surely there won't be anybody else than Aruji-sama who can possibly do that from the first time they see it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……. And, what was that technique that you used on me barehanded?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's a secret technique to hit the acupuncture point of human body that had been passed down in the country of Koto. It's the ace up my sleeve."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was somewhat similar with the martial art that Philuffy was using, but Yoruka's technique seemed to go further by pressing the vital point of human body with a finger to steal the body's freedom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I thought, you are amazing Yoruka‐I still can't match you even after my body has been strengthened with Baptism."</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though Lux should be above her when it came to pure physical strength, he easily lost in the way of using that strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, my position will stay just like before‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka in her black outfit stood up from the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">She intended to consider this matter over with this.</p>
<p class="null-p">But‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. For now."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka's mouth was hanging open when Lux said that,</p>
<p class="null-p">"What does, Aruji-sama mean?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoruka will become my queen if I win the two matches against you right? Then‐I'll challenge you again later after I polish my skill more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl in black clothes opened her eyes wide like a saucer in surprise. She was staring at Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a rare expression for her. He thought it was adorable.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eerr‐, that's……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I won't give up."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux interrupted Yoruka's words and smiled strongly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I was able to win in the Drag-Ride match, then next time I'll show you that I can become stronger even unarmed too. So strong that Yoruka can have a peace of mind even without killing your own ego to become a tool."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was Lux's objective.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka was worried for Lux who would be exposed to more danger because of his standing that would become even more complicated by welcoming five queens. But Lux was telling her that he would become stronger himself so that she didn't need to live in the shadow.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was telling her that he would work hard to convince her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why? Why is Aruji-sama going that far just for my position‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I‐want Yoruka to live as a human."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka's parents feared her as an inhuman princess who didn't have human heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka herself didn't feel like denying that. She felt that there was no problem as long as she stuck to her mission by relying on her own ability.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐Lux was looking at a tool like Yoruka as a human.</p>
<p class="null-p">Not just that, he was telling Yoruka who had the feeling of love sprouting in her that he loved her as a woman.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka stood still for ten-odd seconds with her astonished look. Before long she accepted Lux's will with blushing cheeks and a captivating smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I really can't match Aruji-sama. I believe that I'm someone who is extremely loyal to my own mission but"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka let out a small sigh and all tension left her body at the same time.</p>
<p class="null-p">He moved to where Lux was sitting at the other side and sat beside him. Then she gently leaned on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aruji-sama is far more obstinate than the like of me. Whether it was when we first met, or even now‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, can I take it that you accept that I'll continue challenging you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When Lux defeated her in her two matches in the future, she would accept becoming his queen.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, at that time please allow me to happily accept Aruji-sama's proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐I won't let Aruji-sama win that easily. After all I can't possibly hold back and lose and expose Aruji-sama to danger because of that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka chuckled and muttered suggestively.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux could only smile wryle.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were equal as Drag-Knight, but he still had no confidence of being able to defeat Yoruka in unarmed combat.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, he wanted to somehow make it a reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wouldn't be easy because there were also the other girls and his official duty but‐hard work for the sake of bringing peace to this world that he protected with everyone wasn't anything painful for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, we are tired so how about we go to sleep already today? ‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's breathing stopped the instant he said that and moved to stand up.</p>
<p class="null-p">His thought stopped for a moment from the sensation of Yoruka's soft lips that was pressing on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Warm tongue slipped in and the slippery texture of saliva numbed his brain.</p>
<p class="null-p">His consciousness was blown away during the ten-odd seconds of kiss with her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It seems that Aruji-sama is still weak in this kind of match."</p>
<p class="null-p">*Puhah* Lux breathed in and his face blushed crimson. Yoruka smiled at that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, Yoruka. That's‐!? We are, still inside the academy……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's heart was pounding hard. He tried to stop her in panic.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the girl in black clothes didn't stop.</p>
<p class="null-p">She grabbed Lux's hand and sealed his movement while pushing him down on the sofa.</p>
<p class="null-p">Without pause she pecked on his lips once more while pushing her breasts on his chest further.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Puhah……! Haa, haa……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The beautiful black haired girl slowly opened her black clothes and exposed her naked upper body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression was melting with rapture and expectation. An alluring seductiveness was radiating from her.</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut/illustrations/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut_vol_20_11.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"This is Aruji-sama's fault. If Aruji-sama whispered your love that passionately to me‐I too will become strange."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, Yoruka……. Could it be, you're out of control? Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux blushed and writhed fretfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, when Yoruka's fingertips crawled on his bared chest, he was assaulted by a mysterious sensation just from that and his movement was controlled.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her sweet scent put Lux's mind into a daze.</p>
<p class="null-p">The two's sigh was mixed together from the close distance.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their lips pressed together so many times they forgot how many times they had done it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their body that was pressed tightly on each other felt so hot that even the night's temperature was completely outside their notice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you dearly. ‐My beloved."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's consciousness also turned hazy seeing Yoruka smiling at him with such enraptured expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">The inhuman girl who was abandoned due to not possessing human heart was expressing her love to him from her own initiative right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">(‐As I thought, Yoruka is a human.)</p>
<p class="null-p">It was just that the subtlety of her heart was difficult to understand, but she was definitely a human.</p>
<p class="null-p">He had thought that from the beginning, but he felt happy to see the reaction from Yoruka herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Thank you, Yoruka."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux told her. His words were filled with his gratitude for serving him loyally until now, and all his feelings toward her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He gently caressed her hair. It made Yoruka happily rubbed her cheek on him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now he had even completely forgotten the fatigue from the mock battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their time alone was short. Before Lux realized it his consciousness was slipping into darkness.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt listless as though he had used up all his stamina.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aruji-sama, good morning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn, uu……. Eh? Yoruka‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">When he noticed Lux was on a bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was within a wooden room‐his familiar room in the girl dormitory.</p>
<p class="null-p">The clock's hands were showing that the time was early morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka was in her academy uniform sitting on the chair beside his bed while staring at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Strange……. Even though I should be in the academy, I'm sleeping in the girl dormitory before I noticed it.)</p>
<p class="null-p">If he remembered right, he tried to persuade Yoruka to become his queen and had a duel with her. He remembered until that far but‐his memory after that was a bit hazy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noct-san will arrive soon, so I'm thinking to at least give my greeting to</p>
<p class="null-p">Aruji-sama before parting. I will mostly keep myself hidden from here on too after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a special meaning in Yoruka hiding herself.</p>
<p class="null-p">In order to protect Lux from criminal and assassin, she would hide herself from now on too and secretly watch his surrounding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I thought, I want to protect Aruji-sama as your shadow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see……"</p>
<p class="null-p">In other words, Yoruka had no intention to become his queen at present.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, you will accept my challenge again right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Lux hadn't given up making Yoruka his queen.</p>
<p class="null-p">He swore he would become strong in unarmed combat too and defeated her one day to make her his queen.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't want to treat Yoruka alone as a "special case".</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux sat up on his bed and clenched his fist with renewed determination. She smiled in respond.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I shall accept it anytime. I too will earnestly continue to polish my blade for Aruji-sama's sake."</p>
<p class="null-p">And then she too would give her cooperation so that Lux's skill wouldn't dull from the peace.</p>
<p class="null-p">She readily consented to going along with Lux's challenge in the future too in order to make Lux's skill in unarmed combat improved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐, if Aruji-sama want to make me your queen, then there is one more way."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux tilted his head in puzzlement. Yoruka in her uniform walked to his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, her finely shaped lips sweetly whispered into his ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aruji-sama‐just need to make me pregnant. As expected, if that happen then even I will become unable to serve as Aruji-sama's guard after all."‐!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka's cheeks were dyed slightly pink.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's face also got on fire too for a moment from that blunt love confession.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"If Aruji-sama wish for it, you can just work hard in that area you know? It's fine even if we continue from last night from here on, everyday‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka said that while leaning her weight on Lux and sending him a flirtatious glance from her eye that was hidden behind her hair.</p>
<p class="null-p">The passionate approach from her caused Lux's rational mind to be a step away from bursting once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">(N-no good!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux clearly felt how he weak he had become toward Yoruka's advance now that they had become romantically joined.</p>
<p class="null-p">However flirting with a girl who was his junior inside the girl dormitory for even more than this was‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux-san, are you awake? About your schedule today……, ah‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct's voice right after knocking the door changed in tone as though she had guessed something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Recently I kept getting this kind of role, so I'm thinking of watching from start to end without leaving this time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait! We aren't doing anything right now! I'm telling you it's fine!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux hurriedly made an excuse toward Noct who was telling him that with a blank gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, I also don't mind. More importantly, if Noct-san want to then we can together‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't cause even further misunderstanding……-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who was a doll was becoming more and more human everyday beside Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">Such daily life might also be fun.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, looking at Yoruka's unreserved words and behavior, it felt like there would still be a lot of problem even if she accepted the position as his queen.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Episode 6 ‐ The Dear Friends, The Royal Guards (Triad Chapter)</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"King Lux. Your majesty, please wake up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"N, nn……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The morning air had the scent of early spring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt the sunlight that was shining in from the curtain while dozing off.</p>
<p class="null-p">The calm voice without any intonation was hitting his eardrum with orderly rhythm.</p>
<p class="null-p">When he cracked his eyes open slightly in respond to that familiar fce, he found the face of a black haired girl.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's time to wake up. About the schedule today‐first is"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-wait a second Noct!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's consciousness cleared up and his body shot up while he raised his voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……What is it? The schedule for waking up in the morning should be correct."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct was expressionless like usual, but what bothered him wasn't that.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was in the palace of the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux came here from Cross Field in order to have meeting and conversation with military officers and civil officials because he had taken over the official duty as the king from here on.</p>
<p class="null-p">This time he would only stay here for two days, but the Triad had undertaken the role as his aide and guard during his stay in the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, Noct being here waking him up wasn't strange at all but‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not it, your appearance‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux asked while staring closely at Noct.</p>
<p class="null-p">The simple maid uniform with base colors of black and white and the white brim on her head perfectly suited Noct's personality and demeanor.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Doesn't it suit me? That's unexpected. I thought of this outfit as my formal uniform as someone who came from a servant family like Leaflet House."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her expression was blank like usual, but perhaps it was just his imagination, it felt like she was saying that while staring fixedly at Lux in dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, it suit you, yeah."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I'm relieved. Then your majesty, please wash your face and change your clothes. I have prepared the ceremonial clothes for today."</p>
<p class="null-p">On the table inside the bedroom, a bucket filled with water and ceremonial clothes that were tidily folded had been prepared.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that everything was ready as befitting Noct who had the selfconfidence as a first class maid.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, there was something that Lux wanted to say before he changed clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, can you do something, about the way you call me your majesty?" It felt too distant to be called that by his friend, his comrade-in-arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct responded to Lux's question with an exasperated half-opened eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. Lux-san has genuinely become a king, so even though we aren't in public right now, it's not a mistake to form this kind of habit inside the palace. I'm unable to comply with that request as a member of Leaflet House."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux fell into thought for a bit after Noct flatly refused like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry. You're right, I was lacking the resolve."</p>
<p class="null-p">He said that and apologized, then he washed his face and started to change clothes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was just for a year.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if he only served in the role as the representation of king, he reflected that his thinking was too naïve.</p>
<p class="null-p">He would only become a clown if he didn't pay attention to his speech and conduct based on his current position.</p>
<p class="null-p">As someone who was a member of an imperial family in the past, he would give his all to restore this country after Queen Raffi's death.</p>
<p class="null-p">That mental preparedness of his was about to slacken in the middle of his daily life.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The breakfast has been prepared, this way."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct led him outside the room. It seemed she had quickly grasped the structure inside the palace.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the stone corridor outside, Sharis was standing while wearing a cape and a sword on her waist.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur was also showing her face at a slight distance away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Most likely Yoruka was also standing watch somewhere but‐she wouldn't show herself as long as there was no danger approaching Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fundamentally it would be just the Triad who were guarding him during his stay for two days here.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Yosh, I need to pull myself together and give it my all to do my work carefully!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux held his head high and headed to the dining hall. Midway, Noct softly talked to Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, about the matter just now‐I shall call your majesty in the way that you desire when we return to Cross Field."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Thank you Noct."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux felt grateful for her consideration as his friend and his day as the next king began.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like he would become busy too today.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">The first day passed with only inspection and meeting in the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">Discussion about the national defense, the compensation for the soldiers who got wounded from the battles until now.</p>
<p class="null-p">The management and stabilization of the Ruins, the treatment of the DragRides, etc, etc‐there was no end to the meeting.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, there were expert officials who aided him in each matter, so Lux only needed to hear everyone's opinion and gave instruction about the matter in a broad way together with Dist but‐the matters weren't really simple.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though the battle had ended, there were a mountain of problems for the reconstruction.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were also voices that appealed how they had raised achievements in the battle against the Lords, so more materials should be taken out from the Ruins for them‐there were even voices that demanded to make use of the Ruins themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">(But‐that's no good.)</p>
<p class="null-p">If they used the technology of the Ruin thinking that it was fine if it was only them, then certainly the reconstruction would progress a lot more smoothly.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, if the new kingdom that had three Ruins within its territory took out the materials of the Ruins as it pleased, the other countries wouldn't just stay quiet.</p>
<p class="null-p">They would fear that the military of the new kingdom would surpass them and there was no doubt that they would attempt to trespass into the other Ruins too.</p>
<p class="null-p">If that happened‐a war over the Ruins would break out once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why they asked Aeril as the survivor of the Lords to manage the Ruins in a neutral position.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her permission was needed to use the Ruins while the amount of Drag-Ride that was distributed to the whole world was being controlled. At the same time the Ruins would be gradually suspended. That was the principle about the Ruins that was being displayed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time where each country had to face the loss that was born from the battles would begin from here on.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux didn't want to burden the people with even more tax increase but, if he was aiming to build a country that didn't rely on the Ruins, then he would also need to resolve himself.</p>
<p class="null-p">But there were also those among the noble military officer and civil official who didn't want to accept that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone implored so that they and their own faction could be given special treatment.</p>
<p class="null-p">There were a lot of troubles for Lux even though he was just a temporary king for a year.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Queen Raffi, Lisha-sama……)</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only now that Lux keenly felt just how heavy the burden that they were trying to shoulder.</p>
<p class="null-p">He didn't know how far he could go as a king rather than as a knight.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Lux braced himself to give everything he had for this one year and tackled his duty.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">The second day of his official duty quickly ended.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux wearily collapsed on the sofa in the palace's break room. Three girls were accompanying around him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thanks for your hard work today‐Lux-chi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur who was dressed in her royal guard outfit called at Lux who collapsed on the sofa tiredly like a dried fish. Beside her Noct in her maid outfit looked at her in exasperation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tillfur. Please don't make my effort to be in vain."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, you're right. My king, Lux-sama! Your majesty!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The brown haired girl corrected herself in panic. There wasn't a shred of manner and tension from her.</p>
<p class="null-p">The only saving grace was that right now there wasn't anyone else around him other than the Triad.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief, it's unheard of that there is a royal guard who is making fun of the king. There is a need for his majesty to hand down a punishment later like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……. Punishment? It won't be anything perverted right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur played stupid in respond to what Sharis pointed out.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis displayed a shadowy smile seeing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be the one to give you the punishment directly you know, Till. It looks like you won't understand unless you get punished a bit huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, no way. Sorry……I'm reflecting."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Should I have you run twenty laps around the training ground when we return to the Cross Field? That will be just the beginning."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I said I'm sorry! Reallyyy!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur was getting into a panic. Lux slowly raised his body beside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, he smiled wryly at Tillfur.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Just ten laps will be fine. For this time that is. Be careful from now on in the palace and the capital okay, Tillfur."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh, is that fine?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur who had teary eyes asked Lux back with surprise.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. You have worked hard as bodyguard yesterday and today, and also while we were travelling. But, do half of the punishment to make the lesson stick okay?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Waaai! Thank you……very much your majesty!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis and Noct tapped her shoulders at the middle, so she hurriedly corrected her tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis sighed in in exasperation while sitting close beside Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My gratitude for your majesty's clemency. However please keep it in moderation. It's human nature to take advantage of someone's kindness."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Your majesty is too kind."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……. It looks like I'm also still lacking the self-awareness, so I'll try to do better from now on."</p>
<p class="null-p">To be honest, he was helped by Tillfur's casual attitude.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Lux himself who wished to be the next king, so his relationship with the Triad who was staying at his side as his royal guards became stiff and formal at the surface, but emotionally it made him felt lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he was unable to speak such pampered words.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was already blessed enough that he had friends who knew him well accompanying him in his work as a king.</p>
<p class="null-p">They too originally didn't have the responsibility of going this far for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐it was the three of them who asked Lux to become his royal guards.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was really happy for their feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why Lux was thinking that he wanted to compensate them in the trip this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your majesty, it will be time for a break soon. Please go take a bath."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux ate the food that Noct had arranged to keep Lux's condition well, then he took a bath and slept.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected from a girl who aimed to be first class as someone who came from a family lineage of servant, she did perfectly in every aspect.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">The next morning after Lux safely finished his two days of official duty in the capital‐, the day he returned to the fortress city Cross Field finally arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct knocked Lux's room and opened the lock while wearing maid uniform like usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she woke up Lux, Sharis and Tillfur also entered inside.</p>
<p class="null-p">The three of them changed to their academy uniform while also preparing for their return.</p>
<p class="null-p">In their estimation, they would arrive to the academy at noon and then rested their body in Cross Field for the rest of today and tomorrow but‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your majesty, there is something that I wish to ask‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct in her maid uniform was tilting her head while holding a paper.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For some reason, there is a new blank day created in the schedule?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. I'm thinking to go sightsee and relax for a bit before returning back today."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……It's not in the schedule though."</p>
<p class="null-p">"How about, changing the schedule? Either way we have holiday today. There is also a town on our way home, so let's go play for a bit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct made a reproachful glare. Then her gaze moved from Lux to Tillfur.</p>
<p class="null-p">"This is Tillfur's fault. Because you are always behaving carelessly that his majesty also become corrupted."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that really my fault!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur was bewildered because Noct suddenly recited a charge against her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, wait you two."</p>
<p class="null-p">There the leader Sharis interrupted between them. She mediated between the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">She turned toward Lux and then kneeled courteously on the spot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Your majesty, is this something necessary? Resting is also an important job for a king."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. But, after this we won't have any empty schedule for a while."</p>
<p class="null-p">In fact, Lux's official duties were also doubling because of his plan to marry five queens.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then that's all the more reason to not go sightseeing here. Your majesty should rest your body properly while you still have the time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also intend to rest. That's why I'm thinking to stop by at the relaSquarey town on the way to Cross Field. There is also a large inn that is managed by Aingram Company there."</p>
<p class="null-p">Square was a small town that was located between the capital and Cross Field.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was surrounded by beautiful nature and it was a sightseeing spot and area of noble villas. A lot of people went there for relaxation.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had visited that place several times for doing chores in the past, but he had never gone there even once since he entered the academy.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Excuse me, but I don't see where your majesty is going about this?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct spoke up once more. Lux made a troubled smile and told them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About the graduation trip that everyone talked about before, how about going to this place for that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">All the Triad opened their eyes wide in surprise hearing what Lux said.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 5</p>
<p class="null-p">An hour after that‐in the morning.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux and the Triad arrived at the relay town‐Square that was located slightly far from the capital.</p>
<p class="null-p">First they headed to a large inn that was involved with Aingram Company and checked whether there was empty room there.</p>
<p class="null-p">If the inn was full, they intended to head back to Cross Field right away because they had no intermediary with other inn and there would also be security concern, but fortunately there was a single room for four people available.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm glad. It's lucky that there is an empty room."Yes. It must be because of our daily good behavior."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis sighed in relieve. Noct also nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition Tillfur showed a mischievous smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I wanted to continue it for a bit more though"‐. Lux-chi's princess carry event."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha……. It was a bit embarrassing to be carried like that I think."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Though it was also because of Lux-san's own fault."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct retorted at Lux's complaint.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because of the sudden change in the schedule to spend a day for sightseeing tour, the Triad stopped Lux to wear his own Drag-Ride during the trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">If Lux was going to use up a whole day that should be for his rest for playing around, he couldn't use Drag-Ride at all during the trip in order to save up his stamina. In exchange the three girls of Triad carried him in their arms in turn.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was complaining like that, but he too obediently accepted that decision.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, I'll show everyone around the city. Let's go."</p>
<p class="null-p">After finishing their check-in to the inn without any problem, Lux started walking to lead everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only for one day, but his graduation trip with the Triad now began.</p>
<p class="null-p">The reason Lux proposed this trip could be traced on what happened several weeks ago.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 6</p>
<p class="null-p">"Graduation trip?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, how about Lux-kun coming along too if you want? We'll welcome it you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After a while since all the battles were over, at a certain night.</p>
<p class="null-p">He happened to bump with the Triad at the girl dormitory's corridor. Then Sharis asked him that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We have miraculously survived with all of our limbs intact, so we are thinking to have a graduation trip while we can still act together as Triad right</p>
<p class="null-p">now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aa……. Sharis-san will also graduate at the third month huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">If Sharis graduated, then their Triad group would also end.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place Triad was different from the raid force Syvalles, it wasn't an official group or anything.</p>
<p class="null-p">The title was like a pretext for these three girls who were close childhood friend with each other to act together.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, if just one of them left than the group wouldn't function anymore.</p>
<p class="null-p">They must wish to have a trip as commemoration because they understood that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeep yeep. We're planning to leisurely sightsee somewhere, so you should come to Lux-chi."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur candidly entwined her arms on his arm and invited him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, is it okay for outsider like me to intrude like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I think there won't be any problem. Besides, we are currently considering to volunteer‐to be the royal guards of Lux-san who is going to become the next king after this, so this can also serve to deepen our friendship."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come on Lux-chi, your voice is loud. The matter of you becoming the king is also still a top secret right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah. That's right but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, come with us to our room now. Let's have a secret talk there. We'll also bring tea and snacks."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I'll prepare them at the cafeteria."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct loyally followed Sharis's instruction and then they held a tea party in the girl dormitory's room.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had a secret talk once more there while sipping tea.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So what do you think Lux-kun? While you are working as the king for one year‐can you let us serve as your royal guards?"</p>
<p class="null-p">She said.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's eyes widened from his surprise of Sharis's proposal.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After this you are going to work as the next king for a year. Of course, the girls who will become your queens are all skilled, but there is no way you can use them as your guard."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yep, and we think that Lux-chi too doesn't have any intention for that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur too joined her hands behind her head while saying that with an implicating expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Most likely an intelligent person like Lux-san already understand even without us saying the reason but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well, I can somehow imagine the reason but‐……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux scratched his cheek with a troubled look when Noct turned her gaze toward him at the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was right.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha, Krulcifer, Celis, Philuffy, Yoruka.</p>
<p class="null-p">Other than Yoruka, the other four had their own standing inside and outside the country. With them becoming his queens, it made their standing to become complicated too.</p>
<p class="null-p">They couldn't be treated as his "bodyguard" if they became his queens.</p>
<p class="null-p">Furthermore he couldn't possibly make other queen to serve as his guard while having another queen accompanying him as his companion.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why it was essential to have other people served as his guard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped if you don't want us though. After all our skill are still far below those queens. We were also unable to do anything significant in the final battle‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis said that with a dejected tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Lux immediately shoook his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not true. I mean, if the Triad is going to stay at my side‐there will be nothing more reassuring than that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux said that with a heartfelt relieved smile. The three girls became speechless from watching that smile in fascination.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because these three were comrades-in-arms who had overcome many deathly battles together with him‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because they knew each other well and had formed bond that could be trusted between them‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's expression was telling them that without him needing to say it out loud.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was clear that he was genuinely happy that the Triad was asking to be his royal guards.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief, you are really unfair."</p>
<p class="null-p">Ten seconds later, Sharis muttered with a wry smile and blushing face.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"After all you are always unconsciously seducing the girls around you like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, but Lux-chi, you can't increase the number of your queen even more than now okay~"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There won't be any end to it if in that case."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur and Noct also backed Sharis's statement.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I know that! It was, also the fault of Uroboros's loops, so it was a special case‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">While he was being bewildered like that, Lux noticed that the three of them were making such conversation to hide their own embarassment.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis, Tillfur, and even the expressionless Noct weren't hiding their happy smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux took a deep breath while feeling happy in his heart at their reaction.</p>
<p class="null-p">He straightened his back and faced the Triad once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm also asking from my end. Please take care of me during this one year. Thank you, everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day, Lux immediately announced to his surrounding that the Triad would officially act as his guards.</p>
<p class="null-p">His five queens starting from Lisha, his little sister Airi, the headmaster Relie, and Lord Dist were all consenting to it. And so the Triad was formally reborn as Lux's royal guards.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 7</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐Lux and his guards were making merry at Square.</p>
<p class="null-p">They went around to every sightseeing place with horse carriage, enjoying the scenery while slowly looking around the townscape.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thanks to the war finally being over, there was a festival that had been on hold finally being held in this place. The shops everywhere were bustling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux-chi, this way this way! Let's do fortune telling, They said that this place is accurate."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine but, I'm a bit scared. I don't want to get bad prediction for the country's government."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly at Tillfur's invitation, then,</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, we can just ask fortune telling about our affinity."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis said that teasingly. In the end he was made to do it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Midway they watched a show of a troupe, then eating the famous local cuisine as lunch.</p>
<p class="null-p">After lunch the four of them competed with each other in a game of hitting the target, then at afternoon they moved around again using horse carriage.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that they visited a famous casino. The Triad lost, but Lux luckily hit the jackpot and they decided to hold a victory celebration at night.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis would lead Lux even while playing just like a leader.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur would talk to him from start to end with bright smile and made a cheery mood so that Lux could relax.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct would take care of all the miscellaneous matters properly and acted attentively to the details.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, everyone gradually let out their real self came out and the atmosphere was loosening.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that‐they unintentionally spent a relaxing and fun time for the whole day.</p>
<p class="null-p">At evening they ate food in restaurant as the closing party. They also drank a lot and things got really excited.</p>
<p class="null-p">They reminisced of their memories from when they first met and Lux got chased around in the girl dormitory due to getting mistaken as a pervert until the final battle. They shared happiness with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐night.</p>
<p class="null-p">When the lights in the town were getting fewer, the time for the no-holdsbarred party finally arrived.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the end they gathered in the inn's room and drank there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct was already drunk and held a glass toward Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux-san. Can you pour the wine for me? There is still some."</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected, haven't you drank too much?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Several empty wine bottles were scattered around them.</p>
<p class="null-p">The wine was drank with grape juice and water mixed into it, so it shouldn't be that strong, but everyone was completely cutting loose.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. It's a weak wine so there is no problem. If Lux-san won't pour the wine for me then I'll make Lux-san drink it instead you know?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly when the drunk Noct glared at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought that Noct wasn't someone who usually drank alcohol, but as expected she must be getting bolder because they were in the graduation trip.</p>
<p class="null-p">The way she was drunk while still maintaining the logical part of her was amusing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, just a bit more."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux-chi, me tooo. You got to service me this time, hic"</p>
<p class="null-p">After Lux poured wine to Noct's glass, Tillfur pulled at his sleeve from the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was also putting her arms around Lux's neck.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girls had been earnestly considerate of him during the day, but right now their reasoning capacity had been mostly dissolved by the wine.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was his first time seeing them acting like this. The time that he was spending with them like this also wasn't bad.</p>
<p class="null-p">Rather, when Lux thought of how they were accompanying him until now, he felt happy that was able to enter their circle of memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">Because for Lux who didn't even have friend, the three of them were most likely his first friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"However Isee, soon it will also be announcned to the people that Lux-kun will become king……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis who was sitting on the sofa in front of him seemed to be a strong drinker. She looked like she was still maintaining her senses somewhat compared to the other two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fufu, your position has become completely different compared to when you sneaked into our academy and peeked into the bathroom."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That was because the rooftop crumbled!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"A-ha-ha-ha"</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut/illustrations/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut_vol_20_12.jpg">
<p class="null-p">Lux denied it resolutely, but Sharis laughed it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected, she was only looking composed on the surface while she was also actually drunk.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way Lux-chii, do you have any plan of taking mistress?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur smiled mischievously while looking up at Lux with eyes that had become even more intoxicated.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahaha. As expected even for me going that far is‐……tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux laughed self-depreciatingly, but right after that Tillfur whose eyes were staring still at him hugged him tightly from the front.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine you knoow. I'm fine becoming a mistress if it's with Lux-chii"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wai-wait Tillfur, calm down. You should treasure yourself more."</p>
<p class="null-p">Although he was feeling bewildered, Lux tried to calm Tillfur in panic. But Tillfur puffed her cheeks sulkily and protested.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm saying this because I'm treasuring myself! Becausee, I think I'll be happier that way……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's eyes widened in astonishment.</p>
<p class="null-p">It felt like the flow of air was stopping for several moments, but.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Now then, I guess I'll go enter the bath now. How about you Lux-kun, want to enter together with me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, please wake up from your intoxication a little."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whoops, that's right. You already have five beloved queens. There is no way you can listen to the request of mere royal guards like us."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis brushed up her front hair with a theatrical tone and joked.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that even Sharis who he thought as the one who was the least drunk had also entered a somewhat troublesome mode.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, he couldn't enter the bath together with her even as a joke.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As I thought, I'll enter the bath first by myself‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment Lux said that, Noct who was drinking beside him hugged his arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was expressionless with only her cheeks reddening, but the texture of her chest's bulges that was pressing on him made Lux's heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. However, won't we become unable to fulfill our duty as royal guards if we allow Lux-san to enter the bathroom alone?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait!? Even Noct, what are you saying!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was bewildered because the talk was starting to accelerate toward a strange direction.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's alright Lux-chii. We are in our graduation trip after allll"</p>
<p class="null-p">This time the drunk Tillfur was locking his opposite arm.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was thinking even while feeling bewildered.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that the three of them were drunk like never before and their moral was crumbling.</p>
<p class="null-p">He thought that Sharis, Tillfur, and also Noct as charming girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, Lux couldn't possibly add to the number of his queens even more than this. He had to draw the line.</p>
<p class="null-p">And above all else‐he couldn't possibly let the girls doing such thing while they were in such incomprehensible state due to alcohol.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, in exchange I'll listen to everyone's request, so at least spare me from that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly while rejecting their invitation with desperation. The three girls looked at each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Several seconds later, Noct who was staring fixedly at him muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He is, a bit hesitating with our invitation to enter the bath together."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeaaah……. We gotta tell Airi-chan and the queens about it later……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur made a slightly twitching smile and followed up on Noct's words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Umu. Looks like it's possible that Lux-kun will have an affair depending on how he is approached. We will have to watch over him properly so that the next king won't run wild‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis concluded with a serious face and tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that he was splendidly tricked by the three's combination.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I beg you three please don't! I'll go enter the bathroom first……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">When the atmosphere changed like that, Lux went red and ran away in a hurry to the large public bath at the first floor.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 8</p>
<p class="null-p">After Lux headed to the bath, the inside the large room in the second floor that he left behind, Sharis and others looked at each other and secretly conversed.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had opened the window and let the night wind blew inside. Thanks to that their head became just a bit clearer than before.</p>
<p class="null-p">"So, Tillfur, how serious you were with your statement just now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I somehow managed to gloss it over because of the follow up of you two but, it was almost completely serious……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur hung her head down in respond to Noct's question. Sharis also nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. It seems we are cutting loose too much tonight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. It was dangerous just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">The three of them didn't say anything more than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">They understood even without saying it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though they would never be able to marry Lux, they wanted to stay at his side by being his royal guards who were supporting him‐it was something that they had decided after talking it between them.</p>
<p class="null-p">They understood without even needing to say it out loud because of their relationship as bosom friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief, Lux-kun is really a sinful prince."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the Triad also weren't thinking of seriously trying to secretly nurture romantic relationship with Lux that could make the five queens sad.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were firmly drawing the line there as their friends.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if it was a wish that wouldn't come true forever, they were aware that staying at Lux's side and becoming his strength was their happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, today was the last day that they would hesitate like this‐just as they thought that, Noct realized something.</p>
<p class="null-p">"By the way, how much time has passed? Shouldn't Lux-san return already‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Tsu!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The hands of the clock had moved by a lot while they were talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">The three of them were half drunk, but they pulled themselves together and stood up.</p>
<p class="null-p">They ran toward the large public bath in panic.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 9</p>
<p class="null-p">"And, what is going on here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"H-hmm……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Several minutes later, Sharis and co found a dizzy Lux at the large public bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed he fainted lightly because of the alcohol's influence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Fortunately he was only breathing a bit roughly. There wasn't any worse symptom than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter how much his body had been strengthened by Baptism, as expected he could still get blood rushing into his head.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can only bring him to a cool place and give him water while looking after him……. However"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There is one problem."</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can……only, do it huh,"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three who had slightly waken up from their drunken state looked at each other and nodded.</p>
<p class="null-p">The redness on their cheeks weren't caused solely by alcohol. Their heart was pounding loudly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if they wanted to call the inn staff, other than the guards outside the building, there were only female staffs who were still awake at this time.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then, there would be no point to call them. It wouldn't be any different with Sharis and co looking after Lux themselves.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, Sharis pulled up Lux from the hot water.</p>
<p class="null-p">They put a towel around Lux's waist while doing her best to not look at his naked body as much as possible. Then the three of them carried him to their room.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa, haa……. We somehow managed to break through the first hurdle."</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-well, somehow it also feels like that it's half pointless being all that careful though……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"No. We haven't done anything to feel guilty about. We are doing what the royal guard should be doing."</p>
<p class="null-p">The three were breathing heavily wasn't solely because how troublesome it was to bring Lux to their room at the second floor from the first floor. It was because of a more impulsive feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though their head had been cleared up a little from the alcohol's influence, the three of them were still in an excited state.</p>
<p class="null-p">At such time, the young man who occupied their heart was lying down almost naked in front of their eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">The three of them were losing their bearing in such situation while swallowing their saliva audibly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Achoo……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux shivered from the cold while his eyes were still closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"As expected we can't leave him like this. We need to put on his clothes in front of the warm fireplace‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The three of them lifted up Lux and then they laid him down once more on the sofa in front of the fireplace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"There is no other way, so forgive us, Lux-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis muttered that, then she removed the large towel that was wrapped on Lux's body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Then small old scars and upper body that was sturdily firm for such a lean body became exposed.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How should I say it, it's amazing. Normally we dressed him in girl's clothing and made fun of him but‐as expected, he is really a boy." Tillfur muttered with a shrilly tone and cheeks blushing red.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Don't speak any strange impression like that, let's wipe him dry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct looked calm on the surface, but her hand that was holding another towel was shaking. She wiped it over Lux's skin and dried the water from the bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux whose eyes were closed moaned. Noct's movement stopped still from that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her heart was beating fast regardless of her own will.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct intended to behave perfectly as a servant, but as expected, she was unable to stay calm when touching the opposite sex‐furthermore when it was a young man who she loved.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief, what a troublesome person. He is always reckless every time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah. Even when it was just for the like of us‐he would give it his all to fight."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's nice and all, but it's exactly because of that it gave us complicated feeling like this. It feels like there will be even more woman like us in the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's chest was silently moving up and down with his eyes still closed.</p>
<p class="null-p">There wasn't any sign of him reacting at all to the Triad's muttering.</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct's hands were stopping to move because they were about to reach Lux's lower body that was still barely hidden.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Noct, leave it to me if you are scared. I'll fulfill my responsibility as a leader."</p>
<p class="null-p">"You're gonna to fulfill your last responsibility before graduation here!?" Tillfur retorted at Sharis's suggestion in less than zero point two second.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their face was reddening from other cause than alcohol. It seemed they also understood the meaning of what they were going to do.</p>
<p class="null-p">"S-shouldn't we take turn at least? That's, doing it alone, is unfair."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-you have a point……. Let's do it in turn. Prepare everything else while waiting‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's, I'll go bring some water. I want to make Lux-chi drink it."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Please do. Also, Lux-san looks a bit cold with this appearance, we have to warm him‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct wiped Lux's naked body with a towel while staying real close at his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though her cheeks were reddening, she was properly wiping Lux's body with her expression and gaze staying blank.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I bring the water but, does it look like Lux-chi can drink?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Several minutes later.</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur returned while carrying a large water pitcher and a cup on a tray. She was announcing her arrival while still unable to hide her agitation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yeah. I have also mostly finished wiping Lux-kun's lower body, so it's about time."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, you have finished wiping the body already! Not fair!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-it can't be helped right……? We can't let him catch cold, so the wetness has to be wiped quickly‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis pacified the protesting Tillfur.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though both Noct and Sharis should have become more awake from their drunken state than before, their face was redder now.</p>
<p class="null-p">In a sense, everyone here was drunk from the unrealistic situation.</p>
<p class="null-p">The night air that was illuminated by the lamp and the fireplace's flame was bringing about a strangely forbidden atmosphere.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, at the very least I'll be in charge of giving Lux-chi water!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Saying that, Tillfur poured water from the pitcher into the cup, and then she slowly brought it to Lux's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux also unconsciously opened his mouth as though to drink the water.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, no matter what she tried it didn't like the water would be drank properly. The water was trickling from the corner of Lux's lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What to do now……. Don't tell me, by mouth to mouth? But there is no way I can use that way……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, why are you two staying quiet!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The deeply red Tillfur looked toward the silent Sharis and Noct and yelled.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's……. I'm thinking that perhaps there really is no other way than that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"B-but……as expected that will be bad isn't it? That's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. However, we are nursing Lux-san, so isn't it alright to not think about it too deeply like that?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Triad were surrounding the naked Lux who was breathing a bit roughly. They looked at each other's face.</p>
<p class="null-p">After thinking worriedly for a while, the three nodded together.</p>
<p class="null-p">Like that‐the night of the graduation trip of the Triad was growing late.</p>
<p class="null-p">It became a night that the three couldn't forget in various senses.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 10</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa……. I'm really sorry for yesterday. It looks like I have really troubled everyone."</p>
<p class="null-p">The next morning. Lux had completely recovered and said his thanks to everyone in front of the inn.</p>
<p class="null-p">After blood rushed to his head in the bath and he fainted, he heard from the Triad how they called the inn's staff to carry Lux, and how after that all three of them were nursing him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aa, yep. You don't need to mind it Lux-chi. S-say, Lux-chi, do you remember anything about last night?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike usual, Tillfur was muttering her question anxiously with blushing cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason she seemed flustered and embarrassed. Was it because of how she got drunk yesterday and blurting out those words?</p>
<p class="null-p">Though he couldn't remember the specific of what she was saying.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I only remember until I entered the bath I think. That's all that remain in my</p>
<p class="null-p">memory‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">If he recalled correctly, Tillfur was saying something about how she was fine becoming his mistress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-that was! How should I say it, I only said that because I was drunk, so there is no need to think deeply about it! But, I also wasn't completely</p>
<p class="null-p">joking‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur's eyes were rolling in circles in her panic. Lux smiled at her with a troubled expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">The tone of his voice was an intimate one that was directed toward a friend he felt a deep affection for.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Well……. We were doing something even more amazing that that last night though……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Though I don't really remember what happened after that because of the alcohol, so perhaps it was just a dream……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis and Noct were watching Lux and Tillfur's exchange with a sidelong glance while talking secretly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Anyway, thanks to Lux the Triad were able go through a time of fun memory.</p>
<p class="null-p">They intended‐to feel satisfied with that.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were thinking that it was happiness even just from staying beside someone they loved and supporting him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"After Lux-kun's work as king calm down, how about we think of a way to become Lux-kun's concubine? If it's those five and Airi-chan, it will be possible to persuade them somehow."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Though I think it will be a very difficult operation to pull off‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"It will depend on what happen from here on I guess. Though perhaps it will depend on whether we can endure it or not rather than anything that Lux-kun might do."</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the hearts of the girls who served as the royal guards were wishing for more than that.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why‐there was no knowing what would happen in the future.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait-, what are you two whispering over there. Even you two did something like that to Lux-chi didn't‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur misunderstood Sharis and Noct's conversation as them talking about her behind her back. She yelled loudly at them from some distance away.</p>
<p class="null-p">She covered her mouth in panic just after she said that, but it seemed that she was too late.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, what were you three doing to me while I was sleeping!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nothing at all! Now then, let's go back to Cross Field! Everyone in the academy is waiting for us!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Airi too must be worried. Let's go back Lux-san."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm worried about what could possibly happen to my body here……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Triad equipped their Drag-Ride and forcefully carried the bewildered Lux in their arms and dashed off.</p>
<p class="null-p">The next king and his royal guards were rushing through the land that was stretching under the azure sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">They dashed off while hiding a feeling that they couldn't suppress to be mere friendship and wishing for the realization of their dream.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Episode 7 ‐ The Princess's Proof (Lisha Chapter)</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">*Drizzle*. Rain fell like a mist.</p>
<p class="null-p">The veil of thin cloud that was covering the night sky of the royal capital Lordgalia was hiding the world of tranquil night.</p>
<p class="null-p">The preparatory period of Lux becoming the next king was over‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">The marriage ceremony was held at the capital together with the graduation of the academy's third year students.</p>
<p class="null-p">The night before that‐Lisha was tinkering with Drag-Ride at the Drag-Ride hangar.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was located in the ground of the palace, so unlike the Drag-Ride hangar at the academy, this place was inconvenient to use.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, she couldn't stop her hand from working.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He is really late. How long he is going to take, that Lux‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">All the arrangements for the wedding ceremony had been finished.</p>
<p class="null-p">What was left was only to sleep while looking forward to tomorrow but, Lisha was unable to sleep.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though I won't mind if he can be here since yesterday at least for this kind of time. Good grief."</p>
<p class="null-p">The schedule of Lux returning to the palace was delayed. It was bothering her greatly.</p>
<p class="null-p">……No, it's not that guy's fault."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha was wearing the white robe that she was familiar with. Her hands that were tuning the Drag-Ride stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was extremely busy because he was going to marry five queens, and because he was serving as the next king of the new kingdom‐although it was only for form's sake.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, Lux was giving it his all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Am I just being uneasy? As I thought, perhaps it would be better if I didn't allow him to marry the others."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha spoke with a bitter smile while continuing to give maintenance to the Drag-Ride indifferently.</p>
<p class="null-p">The work was over before long.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Fuu, I finished it somehow. Well, I won't announce it because it'll be out of place in a wedding ceremony though!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha muttered to herself and laughed it off.</p>
<p class="null-p">She washed her hands and her face from the oil, then she stared at the night scenery from beside the fireplace inside the hangar.</p>
<p class="null-p">What Lisha was tinkering with just a moment ago was a new type of DragRide‐, something that she tuned for manual labor.</p>
<p class="null-p">From now on the new kingdom would reduce its battle strength little by little and steered the country to the direction of developing the economy.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if it was done drastically in one go, the country would become unable to deal with potential danger.</p>
<p class="null-p">To be able to display strength for battle too when pushes comes to shove‐a Drag-Ride with such balance was in the middle of development right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">Or perhaps, is there anything else more princess-like that I can do? No‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Unlike when Queen Raffi was ruling over the country, this time Lux was the king.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even that would only last for one year. He was a king that acted as a symbol, so he wouldn't be able to interfere with the government too much.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course Lisha too would also be present at the official businesses too as a queen but‐was the best she could do was only something like this as a Drag-Ride engineer?</p>
<p class="null-p">While she was thinking something like that, a human presence was approaching the hangar.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Alma huh, you don't need to guard me, go to sleep already."</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's my line, Ane-ue."</p>
<p class="null-p">Her little sister Alma who was wearing academy uniform and blonde hair that was tied into a short ponytail talked to her with an exasperated tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed she came here to search for Lisha who slipped out from the palace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even though this place is still within the palace ground, please stop doing something so dangerous. Although there are Drakes watching the surrounding, this place has thinner security than inside the palace."</p>
<p class="null-p">"What's with you, do you come here just to nitpick on me?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm worried. Ane-ue work until this late at night‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I get it."</p>
<p class="null-p">Silence fell between the sisters.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so Lisha continued looking up to the night sky outside the window from inside the hangar.</p>
<p class="null-p">Ane-ue, it will be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Alma spoke without criticizing Lisha who wouldn't return to inside the palace.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The Black Hero-dono‐won't do anything that make Ane-ue sad. He will surely make Ane-ue happy."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha guessed her little sister's intention from that sentence.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alma must be thinking that she was waiting for Lux's return due to anxiety of her marriage and the future of the new kingdom from here on.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I know."</p>
<p class="null-p">"The other four queens are certainly formidable rivals but‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……you're right but, this isn't, about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha powerlessly smiled to persuade her little sister.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not anxious because I lost Haha-ue or because that guy isn't at my side. It's also not because I'm thinking something like the other girls are taking him away from me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, why is Ane-ue still working even at the night before the wedding ceremony?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't know. But, I want to do this. Until that guy return to this palace."</p>
<p class="null-p">After muttering that, it felt like the mist that was inside Lisha's chest until now was clearing up.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't say I don't warn Ane-ue if you stayed up late and yawn at your wedding tomorrow."</p>
<img class="null-img" src="https://null-library.github.io/lib/en/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut/illustrations/saijaku-muhai-no-bahamut_vol_20_13.jpg">
<p class="null-p">"I'll be fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha told that with a confidence for some reason.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Surely it will become a special time for me that won't make me able to feel sleepy at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alma saw the faint smile on Lisha's face from the side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Alma was entranced by that expression of fleeting happiness.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was the figure of a girl whose true wish was granted after fighting without throwing away her responsibility as a princess even though that status was putting her in agony.</p>
<p class="null-p">"In the past, I was also scared and unable to sleep at night when I became a prisoner of the old empire."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha looked back at her distant past and talked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'll be killed. The world might end anytime. I was feeling scared like that while waiting for father to save me."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alma also knew about that.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the end, Count Atismata chose to prioritize his great cause rather than saving Lisha.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm not intending to criticize Chichi-ue's decision. However since then I harbored a feeling of distrust toward man. ‐But, now is different. I'm so excited that I can't sleep. I never even imagined that it will feel this joyful to be married with the man who I first fell in love with."</p>
<p class="null-p">Is‐that so."</p>
<p class="null-p">Alma nodded and she also looked up to the night sky.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was thinking to accompany her big sister for a bit more with her talk.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to be at Lisha's side before she married tomorrow and became a queen from a princess.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ane-ue, which part of Lux-dono that you love?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-!? What are you asking so suddenly!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alma's question was like a surprise attack that made Lisha flustered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm interested about it. It will be for my reference too in the future."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……The reason of me liking that guy, it's not, really something that I can speak with just several words."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because there are too many things that you like about him?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps but‐it's not anything like that that made me want to go as far as marrying him. ……Maybe."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha replied with a somewhat awkward tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Suddenly she thought to head to the hangar's rooftop as though she was unable to wait for Lux's return any longer.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was cold this late at night even though it was early spring.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the coldness should be abating if the rain had stopped.</p>
<p class="null-p">She wanted to meet him‐quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">She climbed up the stair toward the rooftop with that feeling in her chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">"ah"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha looked up and swallowed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The sky that had stopped raining had a superb view.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a bright starry sky that looked as though jewels were scattered everywhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">The scenery was so beautiful it made her at a loss for words. She looked up to the sky while forgetting even the coldness.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's pretty."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tomorrow will surely be sunny if it's like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a scenery that cleansed and exhilarated the heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was only lacking the person she wanted to be at this place‐Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, she didn't feel lonely.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is that guy also under this starry sky too right now?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes, surely he is also thinking about Ane-ue right now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't know about that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha spoke bitterly with a negligent tone that sounded somewhat mischievous.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That guy……. He is carrying on too many things other than himself, till he got his hands completely full. A troublesome man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"But‐Ane-ue like that part of him right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wrong."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Alma was shocked by Lisha's denial.</p>
<p class="null-p">That guy has a lot of good sides to him. How he is kind, how he perceive the little details, how he doesn't hesitate to work hard, how he is sincere, but you</p>
<p class="null-p">know‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Surely what attracted her the most was something else.</p>
<p class="null-p">Just when Lisha was about to say that, a single Drag-Ride was visible at far away with the moon behind it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lux?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha murmured. Right after she realized who was the pilot, Alma slowly turned her back toward her big sister and walked down the hangar's stairs.</p>
<p class="null-p">Until now she was talking to Lisha to guard her and to keep watch so she didn't catch cold, but she realized that there wasn't any more need for that.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lisha, sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two's gazes crossed with the starry night sky at the background.</p>
<p class="null-p">The distance between them was reduced very quickly.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then, the face of the girl staring at Lux burst into a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux planned to go directly to the palace, but he hurriedly changed direction and landed on the hangar's rooftop.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha slowly walked toward Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You idiot, you're late. How long you are going to make the bride wait huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry Lisha-sama. The meeting was dragging on‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">First they exchanged greeting like that to ascertain each other's presence.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that, Lux immediately made a puzzled expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Were you working? But‐why until this late?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tsu……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha was flustered when Lux pointed that out.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-well, because there was a work to do for the Drag-Ride that is being developed for manual labor. I was just doing it for killing time a little."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason‐she averted her gaze without being able to tell the truth that she was waiting for him.</p>
<p class="null-p">That's no good! If you force yourself to work until late at night when it's this cold, tomorrow it will be‐Lisha-sama is going to marry with me after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Marry, even though Lux was somewhat embarrassed to say that term, he grabbed Lisha's shoulders and drew near to her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha's face was also similarly reddening from embarrassment. However she still counterattacked.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-you yourself, why are you returning back alone when it's this late! That's dangerous. You let your guard down too much."</p>
<p class="null-p">She folded her arms and puffed out her cheeks while criticizing Lux's carelessness.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Lux spoke hesitantly with a troubled expression.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eerr, but, the Triad were also accompanying me until midway. I was alone only for ten-odd minutes. I came here alone because‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's not what I'm saying. Even though the Drag-Ride has a heater, the rainy night is cold‐what are you going to do if it's you who catch a cold huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha glared fixedly at Lux with an upward gaze.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was the flip side of her embarrassment about being unable to give up waiting for Lux even when the night had grown late.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux smiled wryly after pausing for a while and,</p>
<p class="null-p">"I decided to go back even though it's this late already because I want to meet with Lisha-sama quickly."</p>
<p class="null-p">He said that bashfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Awkwardly.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, he stared straight to the girl he loved in front of him and spoke of his true feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I thought that perhaps, Lisha-sama isn't sleeping to wait for me. If that's the case then I have to go back quickly‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-idiot……. What kind of person do you think I am huh"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha reflexively averted her gaze seeing Lux's fleeting smile and muttered.</p>
<p class="null-p">She felt her cheeks, and her body growing hot.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, I'm also a big idiot."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's eyes widened like a saucer at the words that Lisha muttered faintly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I noticed just now‐I was working because I wanted to be at your side."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha got closer to Lux who was still wearing his Drag-Ride with an earnestly relieved smile from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because I, can't skilfully talk about things like the country's policy or the like. That's why, if there is something that I can do then I want to do it. You are also like that right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux in his pilot suit faced Lisha in her uniform.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha had to look up slightly toward him. She stared at his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their face was reflected in each other's eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">"If it's you then surely, you are doing something like that. You are always doing what you can do with everything you have. That's why, if I also do the</p>
<p class="null-p">same thing‐then we will always be together even if our position has changed or even if are separated. I was, thinking like that……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Aa, Lux thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">After hearing Lisha's feeling, Lux once more thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">The prince who wished for a revolution in the old empire, and a hero's daughter who sought salvation.</p>
<p class="null-p">After they met the first time, Lux and Lisha's position changed. They became a princess and a knight serving her.</p>
<p class="null-p">Now they would become a new king and a queen who stood close at his side.</p>
<p class="null-p">Toyed by the era and destiny, the two's position and relationship were also moving and changing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so‐there was definitely something that was connecting the two of them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"From now on, I'll support you. Just like how you have supported me until now, that's why‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was waiting for Lux's return. She was doing what she should do.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux quietly embraced Lisha's body in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who endured loneliness and sadness, and yet she still looked forward and fought.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl who showed Lux a path of kingship.</p>
<p class="null-p">His feeling of love toward Lisha was overflowing.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Thank you very much, Lisha-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Wait, don't hug me while I'm dressed like this. I, had just worked until now, I'm smelling of oil right now……I think." Lisha was getting into a panic from being hugged.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Lux wouldn't let go of her body.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love you, truly."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nn……, me too, I love you."</p>
<p class="null-p">He gently whispered into her reddening ear.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha too closed her eyes and lifted her face slightly, waiting for the time their silhouette overlapped.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm sorry to have made you wait Lisha-sama, uwa……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux wiped his hair that was wet due to the rain and changed clothes from pilot suit to a loungewear before he headed to the bedroom‐there Lisha had changed into a red camisole.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what's with that uwah. I have really psyched myself to wear this you know? Yoruka advised me."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was waiting inside the dim room with only the faint light of lamp illuminating the room.</p>
<p class="null-p">The beautiful blonde hair that Lisha had was glowing. Not only that, her figure was giving off an allure that was different from usual. Lux was entranced by her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"No, that's, you're pretty‐it made me unconsciously let out my voice."</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-don't say something so embarrassing! But well, thank you……"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">They weren't inside the palace's drawing room, but the bedroom.</p>
<p class="null-p">She intentionally called Lux to her own room‐it made him conscious whether he wanted it or not.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux recalled when they first met. He was looming over Lisha in the large public bath.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, Lisha's body was hidden by the steam. Even now her height hadn't changed much from that time, but he got the feeling that she had gotten sexier since then.</p>
<p class="null-p">He almost gulped, but to diver his focus he poured a crimson wine into the two wine glasses nearby.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then both of them lightly lifted the glasses and toasted.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-then. In celebration of the wedding ceremony tomorrow"</p>
<p class="null-p">"For our future and the new kingdom's future‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of them lightly drank the wine.</p>
<p class="null-p">The rich aroma filled their nose and spread within their chest.</p>
<p class="null-p">It tasted bittersweet. The rich taste felt like it dazzled their eyes and gave them a dreamy state of mind that melted their reasoning.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Perhaps this is a bit too strong for a drink before sleeping."But, we are just going to rest after this right? Then it's fine."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's face reddened slightly and he smiled at Lisha.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was tiring returning home this late at night, but he was able to meet with this lovable girl whose heart was connected to him.</p>
<p class="null-p">The long-awaited wedding ceremony would be tomorrow.</p>
<p class="null-p">He was happy enough with that.</p>
<p class="null-p">But,</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-what, we can sleep already? Without doing anything‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Tsu……!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha was sitting on the bed with her legs placed in W-shape. She was asking him that with a sidelong glance.</p>
<p class="null-p">The unexpected question made a bittersweet and tingly heat to be born inside Lux's head.</p>
<p class="null-p">Was this, an invitation from her?</p>
<p class="null-p">(But, Lisha-sama is, don't tell me‐)</p>
<p class="null-p">The inside of Lux's mouth felt dry even though he had just drunk wine.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……E-err, do you mean a good night kiss? If it's that‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux took a deep breath, then he somehow made a gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">He wouldn't be able to calm down without doing that‐but.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You, you must be thinking of me as a little kid huh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eeh……?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha glared at him with blushing cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-is it alright, Lisha-sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux firmed his resolve. Then he also got on the canopy bed.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bed sunk slightly with soft elasticity.</p>
<p class="null-p">He silently brought his face closer, and then their lips touched once more. Hot.</p>
<p class="null-p">Somehow it felt like that even though their body temperature should only have risen slightly from the alcohol.</p>
<p class="null-p">After exchanging a kiss for several seconds, they parted from each other slowly. Lisha was staring at Lux in a daze.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I like the kiss just now too but‐. What I want to do isn't that kind of kiss.</p>
<p class="null-p">But the adult kiss. It should be a good time already to do something like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-I see-"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha was also mustering all her courage to the best of her ability, but Lux was also greatly shaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, they were lovers who would marry tomorrow. They had known of each other's feeling enough.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was why, there shouldn't be any problem at all.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Even I am a mature lady. A baby cannot be made just from a normal kiss. I at least know that much."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Y-yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Wait, you only know from there!</p>
<p class="null-p">He had the urge to retort like that, but he was happy that a girl who was estranged from love affair like Lisha was taking the initiative to approach him.</p>
<p class="null-p">(Lisha-sama is mustering her courage. Then I too have to act like a man</p>
<p class="null-p">here……!)</p>
<p class="null-p">Thinking that, Lus kept sitting on the bed while his hands went around Lisha's back.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-then, is it alright?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them stared at each other. Lux told her that even while his voice was trembling somewhat.</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond Lisha looked down shyly while nodding.</p>
<p class="null-p">*Slid*, Lisha took off her camisole.</p>
<p class="null-p">Underwear with pure white lace came into his view.</p>
<p class="null-p">"T-that's……turn around if you can. As expected being watched while I'm doing this is‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"U-understood."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was listening to the rustling sound of fabric for ten seconds after that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's, fine now……"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha was now wearing only her underwear inside the room with only the faint light of the lamp illuminating the darkness.</p>
<p class="null-p">In addition Lisha was putting the bed sheet over her body. She was staring still at Lux with an expression that was a mix of anxiety and expectation.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Lisha-sama, you are beautiful."</p>
<p class="null-p">"D-don't stare like that. Although it can't be helped, this is embarrassing. It's because it's you that‐nn"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux shortened the distance while Lisha was in the middle of talking and lightly kissed her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It makes me happy, Lisha-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……I, I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">They stared at each other once more. The sound of their beating heart was getting louder.</p>
<p class="null-p">They understood each other even without exchanging words when they both had gotten into the same mood.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, wait. I still have two pieces of clothes remaining."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Because with them on, we won't be able to create a baby even after taking all this trouble."</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Yes?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's brain came to a halt hearing those mysterious words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"We can't make a baby without getting naked, hugging each other, and kissing right? Good grief, the way male and female body work is really a mystery."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux's brain froze.</p>
<p class="null-p">He couldn't comprehend what Lisha was saying right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Say, Lisha-sama. Where did you learn that‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eei, don't made me say something like that. From books! Like romance novel or something!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux froze stiff. Then he averted his face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha was fidgeting impatiently during that time. Then she leaned closer to Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's why, I have resolved myself right now. Come at me anytime!" Lisha said that while spreading open her arms.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even though her body was slightly shaking, she put her trust on Lux and acted courageously.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux was feeling bewildered seeing that, even so he suddenly relaxed the tension in his expression and smiled.</p>
<p class="null-p">He felt healed by her feeling.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I love you, Lisha-sama."</p>
<p class="null-p">He tightly embraced her small body.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then the night passed by peacefully.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">The next day.</p>
<p class="null-p">The marriage ceremony of Lux and Lisha were grandly held at the cathedral of the royal capital Lordgallia.</p>
<p class="null-p">"The hero who saved the world and the princess who is the memento of the previous hero are married!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"How auspicious! This is the new beginning of the new kingdom!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That chore prince has grown up splendidly eh……. Lisha-sama has also worked hard."</p>
<p class="null-p">A horse carriage was running through the capital's castle town. The cheers of the people were showering the carriage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Right now Lux was inside the carriage‐together with Lisha who was clad in pure white dress.</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux and Lisha were waving their hand sometimes to the populace while showing gentle smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, the students of the academy and their comrade-in-arms of the Seven Dragon Paladins from the other countries‐all of them were also coming here for their wedding.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How are you feeling? What's your impression being welcomed by everyone as the king?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The carriage passed through the main street and finally returned toward the palace.</p>
<p class="null-p">Midway, Lisha suddenly asked him that from his side when they had completely withdrew inside the carriage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux hesitated for a bit, then he stared straight at Lisha and answered.</p>
<p class="null-p">"To be honest, I might be feeling a bit uneasy. What can someone like me do, will I be able to choose the correct future‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Since his failure in the revolution, since he became the chore prince.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux had been living all this time while thinking that.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐he saw the figure of the ideal ruler from his encounter with Lisha.</p>
<p class="null-p">Since then he fought many battles.</p>
<p class="null-p">Talked with others.</p>
<p class="null-p">Overcame all the dangers and deepened his bonds with the girls.</p>
<p class="null-p">The world widened the place where Lux belonged too when he was originally just alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then now‐he was in the future that he reached.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Things will surely be alright if Lisha-sama is at my side. Surely."</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha nodded happily with blushing cheeks.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I also feel the same. If you are at my side, then surely‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The carriage was slowly passing through the palace's gate amidst the rain of cheers and applauses.</p>
<p class="null-h1">Epilogue ‐ The Weakest Undefeated Bahamut</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 1</p>
<p class="null-p">"Have a nice triiiipp, mommies!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come back soooon"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Leave it to me to house sit desu!"</p>
<p class="null-p">At the seventh Ruin, Moon that was floating in the sky of Turkimes Commonwealth.</p>
<p class="null-p">The Gear Leader Re Plica and young children were waving their hands toward the duo who were going to depart to the new kingdom.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It has been one month‐since Lux-kun finished holding the wedding ceremonies with everyone huh."</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl with braided silver hair, Aeril Vi Arcadia smiled while speaking with a heartfelt tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">The babies who were put into cold sleep hidden deep within the Ruins.</p>
<p class="null-p">She had gathered the few survivors who descended from the bloodline of Arcadia Empire and Xfer and raised them.</p>
<p class="null-p">She was managing the Ruins' function while gradually sealing them to slowly return the technology and knowledge of the current mankind to the normal state.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aeril was passing her days while carrying out that role as her job.</p>
<p class="null-p">She went around the seven Ruins while strictly managing the system, deciphering the hidden information, and rescued the survivors that evacuated into the depth of Ruins.</p>
<p class="null-p">She would help those survivors to adapt to this era and search a place for them to belong.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course the number of criminals and ambitious people with their own private force who were still targeting the Ruins was still many, so she couldn't let her guard down.</p>
<p class="null-p">Every day was always hectically busy for her, but those days were fulfilling for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm unwilling to be treated like mother even though I'm at this age and have never gave birth even once. We should make them call us Onee-sama instead."</p>
<p class="null-p">The brown skinned Drag-Knight Soffice was murmuring with a blank face that looked somewhat displeased.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aeril smiled wryly hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Those kids are smart. They intentionally call us like that knowing that we dislike it."</p>
<p class="null-p">The two of them flew toward the new kingdom while thinking of the children who were growing up well day by day.</p>
<p class="null-p">They flew under the clear azure sky with their Drag-Ride. Then Soffice asked Aeril beside her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Come to think of it Aeril, are you alright about Lux?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">She suddenly asked such vague question.</p>
<p class="null-p">However Aeril instantly grasped the meaning of her question.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was exactly why she was unable to reply right away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You loved him right? How about asking him to be his sixth queen? It's still not too late."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why are you talking about that again at this kind of time?" Aeril asked back with a stiff smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Is it alright for me to ask this when there are other people?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's……spare me from that."</p>
<p class="null-p">Aeril smiled while keeping flying for a while. Then before long she began talking.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I love him. Perhaps, if I insist that I also want to marry Lux-kun……they won't refuse me. Those people are kind after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"…………"</p>
<p class="null-p">Aeril tone seemed light without burden. Soffice quietly waited for Aeril to continue.</p>
<p class="null-p">"But, it's alright. Lux-kun is that kind of person after all, so he always shoulders a lot of things. I can't possibly add even more to his burden than this."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Are you alright with that? You are‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. I'm already saved by him. I'm able to free myself, from the cursed fate of the Lords so……"</p>
<p class="null-p">She could be accepted in this era.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was someone who trusted her feeling and fought for her, liberating her from the chain of hatred of the old era.</p>
<p class="null-p">Aeril was already free now, so…</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see."</p>
<p class="null-p">Soffice also smiled and flew through the sky while drawing closer to Aeril.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, several seconds later Aeril muttered with a small voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Well, perhaps I'll think about it when Lux-kun's term as king is over.</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, Lux-kun's workload might also lighten too."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Aeril……. I think, that's a pattern of failure."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's fine! I'm just thinking, that's all!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The two were flying through the clear sky while making such frivolous talks.</p>
<p class="null-p">The wind and sunlight of spring felt extremely gentle and pleasant.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 2</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, this is it for my lesson. Everyone, please learn it properly."Yes!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis told the students inside the classroom before slowly going out.</p>
<p class="null-p">When she got out to the corridor, Sharis who was now the king's royal guard showed herself as though she had been waiting for her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Looks like you have grown accustomed to being a special lecturer aren't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Please don't make fun of me. I'm still fumbling around with this work." Celis's dignified expression softened into a bashful look.</p>
<p class="null-p">After she graduated, she was studying in the university for the sake of governing the western territory that had been ruled by Dist until now while sometimes she would also show herself at the academy as a lecturer about Drag-Ride.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Also, please don't let your guard down. Perhaps there are still some threats remaining somewhere even if their scale is far smaller."</p>
<p class="null-p">"And yet considering all that, it looks like you are really concerned with the passing of time huh. ‐Well, it's a day where you can meet him after several days after all, so I guess it can't be helped that you are getting impatient and also fired up."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wha-……! The way you said it like that is not permitted! It's not like I'm worrying or anything about Lux so‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, you are saying that he is properly sparing his time to look at you Celis.</p>
<p class="null-p">Looks like he is doing really well with this polygamy life."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis teased Celis with a suggestive tone.</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis's pace quickened somewhat in respond to that while heading to the courtyard.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oh ho, unlike your mouth, your body is honest. Or perhaps‐you can't hold it in anymore?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Enough already! We are inside the academy you know!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">As expected Celis got angry when Sharis teased her once more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"My bad Celis. It has been a long time that I got too carried away."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis apologized with a wry smile. Perhaps she had spoken too far even for a teasing due to jealousy.</p>
<p class="null-p">At the end of the corridor, there were two girls sending an exasperated stare toward them.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was Airi, and Noct.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief, I thought that the two of you have become adult after graduating, but you two haven't changed at all."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ahahaha"</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis laughed off Airi's sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. But, well, is Celis-san a type to act orderly and endure even though you have only just gotten married?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Noct retorted. Then Airi threw her interjection to that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because she is someone who can easily feel lonely even though she look like that. It's more worrying when she is pretending to be tough."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Err, can you two please not tease me too much? More importantly‐why are you two here?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Just as you know, today is the day Aeril-san visit, but we heard from Yoruka-san that it feels like there will be a bit of incident occurring‐" Noct calmly told the two.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How troubling. Even though peace has finally arrived, there are still many people coming out with sinister designs."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi sighed and told them about the situation in concrete.</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed‐some bandits Drag-Knights had grasped the information that Aeril would head to Cross Field this time for giving her report. They were planning to attack by taking one diplomat in Cross Field as a hostage..</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Well, it seems that Yoruka-san will be able to save the hostage soon, so we need someone to take the role of pursuing the bandits but, both of you‐your skill have dulled recently haven't you?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I see, perhaps that is true."</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis's lips slightly relaxed.</p>
<p class="null-p">Her hand was naturally moving toward her sword belt on her waist.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 3</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a sprawling plain slightly to the west of the fortress city Cross Field.</p>
<p class="null-p">The captain of the bandits that were made up of dozens of Drag-Knights was now being completely anxious.</p>
<p class="null-p">They weren't a large organization.</p>
<p class="null-p">They had sneaked out a flute from the chaos of the previous great battle. Using that they were burning small villages at the countryside while making it looked like Abyss's attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">They plundered the villages' fortune and food to expand their organization little by little.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were a group of wretches who attacked the weak like a thief at the scene of fire when the fate of the world was at stake.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were originally soldiers of small country. One day they assassinated their superior and stole the Drag-Rides and formed a group of bandit.</p>
<p class="null-p">However‐even they didn't put much stock to their own strength.</p>
<p class="null-p">They knew that there was always someone above themselves in this world. They would never try challenging the strong.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even at the previous great battle, they only focused on attacking the weak while making it looked like the work of Abyss.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, their consecutive successes created confidence‐a lax in their heart.</p>
<p class="null-p">That was instinctual for any living thing.</p>
<p class="null-p">Before they knew it they started to get bored of the easy victories and of living sneakily while avoiding public notice like a mole. They began to seek for even more stronger battle strength and reward.</p>
<p class="null-p">After the previous great battle, the activity of the Ruins was halted and people and Abyss stopped coming in and out from there.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even if they tried to destroy the outer wall to enter inside, the wall was too solid and normal weapon would be useless.</p>
<p class="null-p">Therefore, they thought that it was impossible to strengthen their force even more than this.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, if they could capture the Ruins' manager who was called Aeril Vi Arcadia, then it would be a different story.</p>
<p class="null-p">It would become possible to open the Ruins with her strength and they would obtain great power.</p>
<p class="null-p">The leader of the bandits eavesdropped a talk that Aeril periodically stopped by at Cross Field. He dispatched his subordinate's Drake as spy and took one unarmed diplomat woman as hostage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their strategy was to use the hostage as bait, then they would surround Aeril and beat her up.</p>
<p class="null-p">The strategy progressed smoothly.</p>
<p class="null-p">It advanced perfectly without the new kingdom army or that famous Syvalles detecting them.</p>
<p class="null-p">That should be the case but‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why-!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">The leader who was piloting EX Wyvern at the sky of the plain yelled toward the unbelievable reality.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were hit by a surprise attack before they could launch their surprise attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">More than ten Abysses that were manipulated with the horn flute and the force that was hiding in the shades of rocks were attacked instead by only several Drag-Knights.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally, the bandits were in pandemonium.</p>
<p class="null-p">The force that was going to attack Aeril was taken down one after another.</p>
<p class="null-p">In that moment‐a call came from another Drag-Knight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You are the captain of the bandit group Hound something aren't you. You have been attacking the villages and towns at remote region with weak security since half a year ago by taking advantage of the chaos‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-who is this! Where did you bastard sniff out this plan!? What's your objective‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"……Haa. What a troublesome person. Don't ask in a rush like that."</p>
<p class="null-p">The calm voice of the girl irritated the leader even more.</p>
<p class="null-p">"For your first question, I am Airi Arcadia. An advisor of Syvalles. And‐" Airi proclaimed to the bandit indifferently.</p>
<p class="null-p">"About this so called plan of yours, we have learned it from some time ago. Though we investigated first whether your group is connected to even larger organization or not. It seems there isn't anyone behind your group, so we'll annihilate your group already."</p>
<p class="null-p">They were left alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">It wasn't that the opponent didn't notice them. They had been detected since a long time ago but the opponent pretended to not notice them‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was them who got spied on. The bandit leader realized that now.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn you……! Men, give it your all! Engage the enemy with all your strength!"</p>
<p class="null-p">"OOOOOOO!"</p>
<p class="null-p">In respond to the man's order, his subordinates who were under attack yelled in fervor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Although they were bombarded by the enemy, they also had a considerable force of their own.</p>
<p class="null-p">They also still had more than ten Abysses at their side.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were going to counterattack with such thinking‐, but then the bandits heard a strange sound.</p>
<p class="null-p">*GAUN!*</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a sharp sound of something slicing through the wind, then several of the Wyverns were shot down.</p>
<p class="null-p">There was a girl clad in huge crimson Drag-Ride at the sky above the plain some distance away.</p>
<p class="null-p">Around her were several projectile weapons with the shape of arrow head floating.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was a Divine Drag-Ride, a machine with high level of difficulty to pilot, but the girl was piloting it skillfully.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me that's‐the Crimson War Princess, Lizsharte!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The bandits shook in their boots.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the leader gave precise instruction even while feeling shaken.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't falter. She is just one person! Bombard her with the Cannons of the Wyrm squad and take her down!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, right after the Wyrm user bandits followed his instruction and readied their Cannon‐the weapons they were holding got shot through one after another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Whaaa-!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Sorry but, you won't be able to shoot her down with attack of that level. You need to be able to read the future at least‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl floating behind wearing blue and silver Divine Drag-Ride chuckled gracefully.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lizsharte approached to right behind her and pouted her lips.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What do you mean by that Krulcifer! Come to think of it, I never have a mock battle with you recently. I should be still stronger than you."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, let's finish this work quickly and test out that claim. They are too much of a letdown that it's dissatisfying."</p>
<p class="null-p">For some reason they began to quarrel with each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, the two's hands kept moving without rest.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bandit Drag-Knights were getting shot down one by one in less than several seconds.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Damn you, release the hidden Abysses! Blow the horn flute!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The leader panicked seeing that and gave instruction to the force at the rear.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, a fight with a different new kingdom army was already breaking out there too.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then‐they were trounced one sidedly.</p>
<p class="null-h2">Part 4</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ei"</p>
<p class="null-p">The purple land battle type Divine Drag-Ride Typhon skated with a speed that couldn't be followed by eyes while launching a punch with its whole weight behind it.</p>
<p class="null-p">Each punch would smash through the core of a medium sized Abyss. The Abysses were returning to dust one after another.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible, how can that much power……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The Drag-Knight who was using the horn flute to manipulate the Abyss was intentionally left alone to defeat all the Abysses first.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the Abysses who flew to escape from the land battle were stabbed by the huge Lance of a girl driving gold colored Divine Drag-Ride. Their number kept decreasing drastically.</p>
<p class="null-p">Of course, they were Philuffy and Celis.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Impossible. What's with that movement, that skill! How can the Abysses are so easily‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that you have any time to worry like that though? It'll be better if you hurry and escape."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi's warning came once more through the Dragon Voice. It flustered the bandit leader.</p>
<p class="null-p">This was the true strength of Syvalles that he heard from rumor.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even the bandit group that should have grown considerably wouldn't even last a minute before it got annihilated.</p>
<p class="null-p">The leader lost its fighting spirit due to the difference in strength that was beyond the imagination. He reached out his hand to use the hostage that was hidden behind a rock as his shield but‐his trump card had vanished.</p>
<p class="null-p">"N-not here! Where did that diplomat go to!? She was still here just now‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"You only noticed it after this late‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">A girl in black clothes wearing azure Divine Drag-Ride appeared from empty air some distance away.</p>
<p class="null-p">The girl was carrying the female diplomat with her armored arms. She then leaped away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"HOOWWWWWWWW!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Yoruka used a function of the special equipment type Drag-</p>
<p class="null-p">Ride‐camouflage to approach close to this position. The leader only noticed it right now.</p>
<p class="null-p">However, the bandit leader shuddered at the stealth ability to approach until this close without allowing her presence to be detected at all despite using camouflage.</p>
<p class="null-p">His only choice now was to abandon everything, his subordinates and his battle strength and ran away.</p>
<p class="null-p">"UOOOOOOOOOOH!"</p>
<p class="null-p">But, he couldn't fight those five Divine Drag-Ride users.</p>
<p class="null-p">While his subordinates were luring them, the leader flew in full speed toward the direction where the five weren't fighting.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, the man saw it at that moment.</p>
<p class="null-p">A huge black Divine Drag-Ride was flying toward him from far away in front of him.</p>
<p class="null-p">(There is another one……. But I don't care! If it's just one then I can blow it away using Howling Roar as long as I can see them coming. And then I'll only need to run away at full speed!)</p>
<p class="null-p">The leader made that judgment and gathered the energy of the EX Wyvern into the head part in preparation of the battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">One second, two second…….</p>
<p class="null-p">The leader heard the Dragon Voice once more while the mysterious black Drag-Ride was approaching.</p>
<p class="null-p">"What a troublesome person. Why are you intentionally choosing to face the opponent with high difficulty?"</p>
<p class="null-p">There was no time for him to interpret the meaning of Airi's exasperated words.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bandit leader could only carry out his best option‐executing the tactic of displaying his maximum power to remove the enemy that was approaching him head on.</p>
<p class="null-p">He pointed the tip of his Blade to behind to pretend that he was going to slash while firing the Howling Roar a step ahead.</p>
<p class="null-p">The moment he yelled to fire the Howling Roar‐an impact ran through the EX Wyvern that the leader was wearing.</p>
<p class="null-p">*ZAGUUU!*</p>
<p class="null-p">"Eh?"</p>
<p class="null-p">A stupid voice leaked out from the man's mouth.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Nii-san is used to that kind of trick. The number of times he had fought in the tournament is astonishingly high. After all he is the Weakest Undefeated."</p>
<p class="null-p">The shoulder that contained the Force Core of the EX Wyvern had been slashed without him realizing it.</p>
<p class="null-p">How did an opponent that was charging from the front and entered the range of the shockwave that he should have fired first dodged it‐.</p>
<p class="null-p">In the first place, the figure of the black Divine Drag-Ride was gone from his front.</p>
<p class="null-p">It had vanished from his field of vision when he realized it.</p>
<p class="null-p">"WHYYYYYYYYYYYY……!"</p>
<p class="null-p">The leader who was taken was falling while screaming. In the middle of it, he saw the black Drag-Knight floating behind him when he turned around.</p>
<p class="null-p">"He passed you by in high speed. He approached you only in half speed, then when he foresaw your strategy from close distance, he accelerated rapidly just before you crossed each other. Nii-san had circled behind you before you could fire your Howling Roar."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux made use of Divine Drag-Ride Bahamut's high mobility after seeing through the opponent's plan and took him down accurately.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Seeing through the opponent's preliminary movement and tactic, then counterattacking in advance. This is‐the technique called Quick Shot." The bandit leader couldn't listen to Airi's words until the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">His Drag-Ride was dispelled and he fell toward the ground in his flesh body.</p>
<p class="null-p">Naturally he was prepared to die, but someone caught him just before he crashed.</p>
<p class="null-p">A brown haired girl clad in the strengthened type general purpose Drag-Ride EX Wyrm‐Tillfur Lilmit.</p>
<p class="null-p">She immediately tied up the leader with the Drag-Ride's wire tightly and took away his Sword Device.</p>
<p class="null-p">With that the bandit leader was completely restrained.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Capture success‐perfect! As expected from mee! "</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. That's splendid Tillfur. Clap clap clap."</p>
<p class="null-p">Beside her Noct who was wearing EX Drake was clapping while staring fixedly at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Wait, this is all we amount to do!? Even though we have come out tooo!" Tillfur went along with the joke and yelled a retort with tearful eyes.</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis who was wearing EX Wyvern smiled wryly while patting Tillfur's head from the side to console her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"It can't be helped. After all the elites of the new kingdom are coincidentally fully present int eh academy. Besides, Lux-kun too‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, that's right. Lux-chi, welcome baack!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Tillfur was dejected, but as soon as she saw Lux landing on the ground, she drove her EX Wyrm in full speed toward him.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I'm back Tillfur. Airi and everyone too‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux in his Bahamut smiled. Then everyone else also gathered around him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone became one with Lux at the center.</p>
<p class="null-p">"How was that, my battle just now. It made you fell in love all over me once again right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"I don't think that you did anything that great though‐?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha puffed out her chest with a smug face, but Krulcifer retorted at her.</p>
<p class="null-p">"That's because you snatched my prey! My Tiamat's firepower is too powerful that it's difficult for me to hold back to not kill them!"</p>
<p class="null-p">They argued with each other like usual.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief, what a troubling juniors I have here. Even though each of you have your own position, you two are getting back to act like children when in front of Lux."</p>
<p class="null-p">Celis who was watching that from a distance muttered with a small sigh.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Indeed. But, Celis-senpai too, was really high spirited."</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy told her with a faint smile. Even Celis's face blushed red hearing that.</p>
<p class="null-p">"P-please don't make fun of me. As a former captain of Syvalles, I have the duty to look after my juniors‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Celis-senpai and Phi-chan too, are both of you doing well? Thanks for your hard work just now."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Lu-chan too, good work."</p>
<p class="null-p">Philuffy and Lux matched each other's gaze deeply. The greeting they exchanged went deeper than just words.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes! Of course. You are really kind Lux, to suddenly call out to me like this."</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi and Noct who saw from the side Celis's eyes sparkling smiled wryly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Don't tell me, she became a lecturer in the academy is also because she hasn't been cured from her tendency to become lonely?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi stared in exasperation at Celis. Noct nodded with her blank expresison. "Yes. But I think that she has become a lot better than the past."</p>
<p class="null-p">It seemed that the degree of Celis's dependence to Lux was still high.</p>
<p class="null-p">There‐Yoruka slashed at Lux's back with her Yato no Kami.</p>
<p class="null-p">The members of Syvalles who had completely let their guard down opened their eyes wide in shock.</p>
<p class="null-p">"!? Watch out-!"</p>
<p class="null-p">Someone yelled that, but Lux calmly held his Blade in an instant to block the attack.</p>
<p class="null-p">Either way, Yoruka's Blade stopped just an inch before it hit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good work in rescuing the hostage. The bandits has been mopped up with this right?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Both of their swords had stopped just before the clashed. Lux then talked to Yoruka with a smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Also, that's a splendid constant alertness Aruji-sama. It looks like you haven't let your guard down even after successfully defeating me in those two matches."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yoruka might run away from the position of queen if I can't reassure you after all."</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux replied gently.</p>
<p class="null-p">One month since he made an agreement of "two matches" with Yoruka, Lux had splendidly defeated her and Yoruka accepted becoming his queen.</p>
<p class="null-p">Even so, it seemed she was uneasy whether Lux would let his guard down after winning against her. Sometimes she would launch a surprise attack like this at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux thought that this way of being considerate was really like her.</p>
<p class="null-p">He told everyone else about it and fixed any possible misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="null-p">While Lux was continuing to rejoice in his reunion with the girls and conversed with them, the bandit who was restrained with a wire all over him suddenly raised a bewildered voice.</p>
<p class="null-p">"W-why……"</p>
<p class="null-p">The overwhelming difference in strength to defeat them without actually hurting them, and the specs of those Drag-Rides.</p>
<p class="null-p">The bandit leader who thought highly of himself as someone possessing high battle strength even among the bandits couldn't help but question what happened.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Why, did you seal the Ruins even though you have that much power……! Don't you want even stronger power!? No, you should even put the world under your rule! And yet‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Haa……. You really haven't investigated enough even though you were driven by greed and intentionally attacked here. Don't you know anything about Nii-san?"</p>
<p class="null-p">Airi who was sitting on the shoulder of Noct's EX Drake sighed and said that faster than anyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Really. I'm amazed you can say that even though right now you yourself are entering yourself into the list of someone who failed because of such conceit."</p>
<p class="null-p">Sharis also shrugged while smiling refreshingly.</p>
<p class="null-p">"You see, it's because Lux-chi is that kind of person‐that's why he was chosen as the king. He has convinced everyone with the way he is."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. Lux-san‐no, it's simply that his majesty is that kind of person. Though he is somewhat too soft on girls."</p>
<p class="null-p">"It's not at the level of somewhat anymore. All of us here are the witness." Krulcifer instantly retorted at Noct's mutter.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lux who heard that showed a flustered expression for the first time today.</p>
<p class="null-p">"I-isn't the talk moving to a strange direction for some reason!? Is this a courtroom for me!?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Isn't it just Nii-san getting your just desert?"</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yes. There is no mistake."</p>
<p class="null-p">The combination of Airi and Noct's fixed stare immediately pierced at him.</p>
<p class="null-p">When it became lie this, he didn't have any dignity whether as the king or as a Drag-Knight.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Oooi, Lux-kun."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yahhoo, young man."</p>
<p class="null-p">"Ah, both of you, long time no see‐"</p>
<p class="null-p">At that time, Aeril waved her hand in her Drag-Ride from the sky. Soffice also gave her greeting with her expressionless face.</p>
<p class="null-p">Their arrival was a godsend for Lux. He raised his hand too and smiled at them.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Good grief……. But, perhaps things can be considered as going well right now despite Nii-san being Nii-san. After all he is managing a lineup of troublesome people like this‐and this country."</p>
<p class="null-p">The group that joined up with Aeril returned back and handed over the bandits after that. Then they had a talk about the situation of Ruins.</p>
<p class="null-p">After that‐surely everyone would get along well with each other even while fighting over Lux.</p>
<p class="null-p">Everyone helping each other, understanding each other.</p>
<p class="null-p">They were surely advancing forward bit by bit.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Then, how about we return to Cross Field's academy soon, Lisha-sama?"</p>
<p class="null-p">After rejoicing in this reunion after quite some time, Lux called out to the girl who was now queen.</p>
<p class="null-p">The princess who Lux once served replied to the king with her best smile.</p>
<p class="null-p">"Yeah, let's begin the dawn of the new kingdom, together with all of us."</p>

<p class="null-h1">Afterword</p>
<p class="null-p">Although the number of commercial works throughout the world is as many as the number of stars, how many of them are a tale that was written from start to end in a way that one can consent with?</p>
<p class="null-p">Akatsuki was thinking about such thing while the end of this series was approaching.</p>
<p class="null-p">Thank you very much for accompanying this long series that had spanned seven years until the very end.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's an obvious fact for the one writing but, the thing called light novel isn't something that can be made alone.</p>
<p class="null-p">No matter which work, since the beginning of the series it is something that is created by the group work of a lot of people to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
<p class="null-p">This series fortunately continued for long. When luck was on its side, the longer it went on, the number and range of people involved with it increased and widened.</p>
<p class="null-p">The editor, the illustrator, the proofreader, the designer, the seller, the people of the printing office, the people of the bookstores, the mangakas of the manga, the anime director, the scriptwriter, the sound director, the voice actors, the game company, the people of the publisher who took care of me for the signing event in Taiwan‐and there are still a lot more people that I don't have enough space here to mention.</p>
<p class="null-p">I who was simply writing this work laboriously in my home alone at first ended up making a lot of people worked for the sake of this series.</p>
<p class="null-p">But, even that work had come to its end before I realized it.</p>
<p class="null-p">The time for change, for parting has come due to various circumstances.</p>
<p class="null-p">When I pondered how should I conclude the series' last volume with the afterword, I suddenly thought.</p>
<p class="null-p">A total of seven years. The one who was involved with this work from start to finish, is none other than I myself and the laptop that I bought when I first debuted and used for ten years until now isn't it?</p>
<p class="null-p">Are there really just two creators who are involved fully with this series that remained in the end?</p>
<p class="null-p">It made me felt uncharacteristically lonesome.</p>
<p class="null-p">But I immediately noticed that it was a mistake.</p>
<p class="null-p">I haven't finished with that part but, let's take a break for a moment from that and continued with my miscellaneous impressions about the characters from before.</p>
<p class="null-p">The remaining characters are Lisha, Krulcifer, and the Triad.</p>
<p class="null-p">First from Krulcifer!</p>
<p class="null-p">Perhaps she is the most popular character including at the anime too. No accurate statistic has been taken, but she is a character that makes you feel like that.</p>
<p class="null-p">Actually she isn't a character I created with too much calculation. I have liked cool character from the start, but I wanted to see that kind of girl expressing her emotion and love, so it became like that at the second volume.</p>
<p class="null-p">It was my favorite scene when it got adapted in the media mix too.</p>
<p class="null-p">Lisha-sama!</p>
<p class="null-p">In a story where a lot of heroines are showing up, I think that the main heroine is the most difficult position. Even though she is a princess, how did she end up with the mechanic attribute?</p>
<p class="null-p">To be frank, it was because there were too many heroines making appearance at the planning stage.</p>
<p class="null-p">Let me rephrase it because it's not explaining enough. In a story a heroine doesn't only need personality and position in the story, they also need to be assigned with "performance role".</p>
<p class="null-p">This series has the concept of multiple heroines from the beginning. There was no childhood friend and little sister character at the planning stage and the editor at that time told me to add them, so it made me didn't want to purposefully create character with the position of "mechanic" which is essential for mecha battle.</p>
<p class="null-p">It's obvious from the example of Airi who has the explainer role, but if someone isn't given such role, they will lack depth. The depiction of each character will be weak and the story will collapse.</p>
<p class="null-p">And so, as a last resort, I thought that perhaps it will be fine for Lisha to have that role from my personal thinking and also for having a role to closely support Lux until the end.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then the Triad. These three are characters who were created due to pressing need.</p>
<p class="null-p">If all the characters are only using Divine Drag-Ride, it won't be clear what are their differences from normal Drag-Rides, and it would also feel strange if all the mob students are nameless, so the Triad are needed as "the symbol of the normal students".</p>
<p class="null-p">But, their individuality thickened as the story progressed and I gradually grew to like them.</p>
<p class="null-p">As I thought, I totally like all the heroines. I love them all.</p>
<p class="null-p">For the last, to the editor and illustrator Murakami Yuichi-sama who has taken part in this long last job.</p>
<p class="null-p">And then to all the readers who has shared this long seven years with me and my laptop, I express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone.</p>
<p class="null-p">I pray that we can meet again someday somewhere.</p>
<p class="null-p">A certain day at April 2020</p>
